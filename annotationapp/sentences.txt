0.87 	 Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos except with a hosts who have a combined IQ of three.
0.62 	 Coulier must've needed to money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
0.77 	 Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are "yesteryear".
0.96 	 These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable!
0.55 	 The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives.
0.58 	 Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'.
0.64 	 Thus signifying everything!!
1.0 	 I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director!
0.54 	 For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say "Snap Out Of It!!"
0.6 	 Totally eighties!!
0.75 	 I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers.
0.88 	 They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past.
0.91 	 I left the cinema feeling glad that I had not been swayed by the IMDb reviewers.
1.0 	 14 hours later I am still trying to find flaws in the plot but I cannot think of anything serious.
0.73 	 It still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way.
0.95 	 David Morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no Michael Douglas.
0.99 	 It's impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot, yet it's believable in a certain way.
0.99 	 As for me, I couldn't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary -"sos malo" ("you're mean")... put in the mouth of DÃ­az, the greatest one.<br /><br />I'm rather tired of seeing movies "designed for" Peretti.
0.77 	 I know he won't make it if it's to follow the rule that "second parts were never good", so if he makes it, I'll surely go see it.
0.95 	 I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time.
0.64 	 No, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems.
0.52 	 A nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not.
0.95 	 I actually prefer the sequel to this film as I like the fact they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is.
0.97 	 The plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart, they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion.
0.58 	 Not sure about this character, at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something.
0.81 	 Not all that good, but I will pick this ahead of that Culkin kid any day of the week.
1.0 	 I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights.
0.76 	 If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas.
0.64 	 In addition to the dramatization of historical events, the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother.
0.99 	 While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference, she does not use it to excuse German society.
0.51 	 She takes care of her, protecting her from the Gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed.
0.62 	 I saw it".
0.83 	 While this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters, it is a historical fact that Goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting Rosenstrasse.<br /><br />The director Margarethe von Trotta, an activist, feminist, and intellectual, is no stranger to political drama.
0.52 	 In Rosenstrasse, a film she worked on for eight years, she had to make compromises, adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced.
0.97 	 The events at Rosenstrasse give the lie to Germans, who say, "there was nothing we could do".
0.52 	 Watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on TV, I watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy!
0.74 	 During the filming, Dev Anand asked Panchamda (R.D.
0.9 	 Burman) to compose something special for this film.
1.0 	 It is considered a "grindhouse" film, which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie (or worse).
0.99 	 With a cleaner sound and picture, this could have been a Hollywood hit, I suspect.
0.91 	 Sure, it's not "The Godfather", but it's not supposed to be.
0.94 	 Well, okay, not really.<br /><br />If nothing else, this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast.
0.63 	 <br /><br />Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more "cutesy" and more upscale, (after all... we are talking about M-G-M) than the standard animated short done over at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or lowly Columbia.
0.87 	 Anyone frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to light up their imaginations would do well to hunt (and I do mean hunt) this scarcely-seen item down.
0.84 	 (aka: DEMONS III)<br /><br />Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films.
0.91 	 It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.<br /><br />An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer.
0.71 	 It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it.
0.58 	 The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee.
0.78 	 Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases.
0.63 	 All the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate,after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don't watch the movie making- just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child?
0.89 	 People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.
0.78 	 This time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery, except for having an extra exit, which is not guarded, very ingenious.
0.97 	 The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again.
0.65 	 All the good stuff more than likely.
0.87 	 Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff.
0.74 	 You'll need it.
1.0 	 Let's talk about the acting for just a second, the Carradine guy who's career peaked in 1984 when he did "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually a great comedy).
0.57 	 He should have did what Mark Hamill did after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night.
0.73 	 He made his mark as a "Nerd" and that should have been that.
0.51 	 O.K.
0.57 	 I just wanted to be sure.
0.81 	 I'll close on that note.
0.99 	 Thank you for your time.
0.6 	 At times there is almost a desperation, as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound, surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside (as did happen to some), Rin-Tin-Tin.
0.92 	 Watch "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia.
0.8 	 This is the film in Antonioni's middle period that most critics dismiss quickly, as a 'flawed' look at 60s American youth culture/politics.
0.77 	 I went to a screening of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me laugh, it had some very major flaws.
0.99 	 It first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real-life divorcee trying to find love in LA.
0.54 	 Jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this man's dates progress.
0.99 	 The context/setting with the old mariner himself is fine, clear, and without pretense.
1.0 	 Who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"?
0.99 	 or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?"
1.0 	 It seems to me, as a recent film school graduate, that in these times of New Zealand film reaching new heights, the general public seems to think every New Zealand film made is great.
0.9 	 My whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh, but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema.
0.99 	 2, of course, a far superior film to this one) in the birth of Polynesian cinema.
0.9 	 I hope Pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from Sione's Wedding in how to NOT reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say.
0.74 	 Even if it is done in a comedic fashion.
0.96 	 Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused.
0.96 	 This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world, I mean seriously, this movie scared the heck out of me.
0.73 	 What the heck?
0.94 	 Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll, but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home.
0.99 	 In this pit they encounter the Greedy, who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full.
1.0 	 This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too.
0.63 	 As scared as I was, I have to admit I'm glad I watched it, sometimes you need a "WTF?!"
0.73 	 movie to spice up your selection, believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me.
0.92 	 It's official, that doll is just plain creepy, let's just put it this way, there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother, a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.
0.51 	 But it's still a good movie, and I did laugh alot.<br /><br />*** (out of four)
0.96 	 All he has to do is get a job as the Blob.
0.63 	 Not only is this a puzzler, but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity.
0.51 	 Huh?
0.83 	 Then there's a short scene where he whacks his former General, and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around.
0.98 	 In the Name of The People turns out to be the regular Friday night tearjerker.
0.96 	 If you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch Dean Man Walking!
1.0 	 Aoki's character is both hilarious and pitiful.
0.97 	 It's mediocre and silly in parts, brilliant and classic in others, with compelling, gripping pacing.
0.52 	 There are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up "Make my day" scene recalls the "Do you feel lucky" one, one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film's Scorpio, an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as Harry's partner - just to name a few.<br /><br />Harry Callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department, still mean, still tough, but now he's older and wearier.
0.96 	 The first film posed a simple question, "What about the victim's rights?"
0.94 	 Vice versa?
0.77 	 Depends?).
0.66 	 And is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister's tarnished rights?
0.98 	 Looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform.
0.73 	 David Duchovny,(Dr. Eugene Sands),"Connie & Carla",'04, was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine.
0.65 	 Dr. Sands was visiting a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie,(Claire),"Taking Lives",'04, who immediately becomes attracted to Dr. David Sands.
0.97 	 Timothy Hutton,(Raymond Blossom),"Kinsey",'04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections.
1.0 	 Gary Dourdan,(Yates),"CSI-Vegas TV Series", plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE who is a so-called body guard for Raymond Blossom.
1.0 	 Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws a great deal of attention from all the men.
0.93 	 This film is not the greatest, but it does entertain.
0.97 	 Then again, that was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch she is today.
0.99 	 At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit...not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger.
1.0 	 Mitchell being Mitchell, the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either.
0.93 	 I can't imagine watching it on it's own, however.
0.8 	 I had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute.
1.0 	 If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you.
0.86 	 <br /><br />The storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes, but in the end I think it made everything better.
0.98 	 The ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise.
0.97 	 Janet has come out to her mother already but Cara's parents are still in the dark about their daughter's homosexuality.
0.99 	 The pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from Malaysia for her younger brother's wedding.
0.96 	 That same week British Columbia legalizes gay marriage.
0.95 	 With Janet wanting to wed, Cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative Chinese parents that's she's gay.
1.0 	 Cara's situation is contrasted with that of Jesse (Trent Millar).
0.98 	 Jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen.
0.98 	 His biological father Daniel (Andrew McIlroy) is coming for a visit soon.
0.67 	 McIlroy, Millar & Sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with, it's no surprise that none impress.
0.51 	 It's possible that the campiness was purposeful.
0.52 	 That time is gone.
0.99 	 In this day we need quality as well.
0.58 	 :Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy.
0.6 	 I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark.
1.0 	 And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite.
0.83 	 I was hooked from beginning to end.
0.59 	 Great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump, but to make you go "What the f*ck did I just see?"
0.99 	 All the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about, so I won't rehash what has already been said.
1.0 	 I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I am a true horror fan, not easily spooked by tripe like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill".
0.94 	 What gave me the bad dreams was the unease I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with those guys.
0.99 	 It's not about Bogeymen that jump out at you,alien invasions, or tons of gore.
0.9 	 So on the one hand, they get what they wish for from an occult book, but may ultimately wish they hadn't.
0.95 	 National Lampoon was once a funny magazine.
0.86 	 Yet still call themselves Batman fans.
0.94 	 Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft. tall top hat.
0.95 	 The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface making the Dummy the whole centerpiece for the character.
0.81 	 and The Joker to an acrobat with dreads.
0.9 	 I suppose many people comment/review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- I'm writing due to the latter.<br /><br />I was excited for the sequel to "Wargames" ..
0.99 	 I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, I felt it was worth watching more than once.
0.65 	 "The Dead Code" was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms.
0.55 	 Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (the real life war machine) that he is a high level terror threat.<br /><br />Even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - The government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity.
0.54 	 They say things like "He has expert knowledge of bio-terror" ...
0.98 	 So then a movie-long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles ensues.
0.92 	 Didn't most western slaves comes from West Africa?
0.99 	 An American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men?.
0.98 	 The miniseries was superb, and it is unfortunate that DH should have gotten his hands on something unique, and made it mundane.
1.0 	 Firstly, I would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors.
0.99 	 a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas".
0.73 	 But I read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value.
0.95 	 See it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies.
0.84 	 He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs.
0.91 	 The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater).
0.64 	 Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards.
0.97 	 I am a huge fan of Say Anything, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (I wasn't that big on Singles), so it's safe to say that I look forward to anything that Cameron Crowe attaches his name to.
0.99 	 Well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong.
1.0 	 Anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory.
0.87 	 I was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end.
1.0 	 In the theatre in which I saw the movie, there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot.
0.98 	 I'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this.
0.88 	 I've heard about this movie for many years, and finally got a chance to see it.
0.91 	 Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens it back up with new recruits, among them Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold), and Sandy (Debralee Scott).
0.57 	 One by one, they are murdered by the killer, until only one remains.
0.68 	 The ending seems like it's thrown together, which is a shame.<br /><br />Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes total, the rest you can just fast forward through.
0.66 	 Maybe catch it on TV, but it's not worth buying.
0.77 	 In music it was a decade that many see as a low point, due to corporate rock and disco.
1.0 	 Some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded- and reek of the then current Arab oil crisis and rampant inflation.
0.86 	 A later film like Escape From New York is an obvious progeny.
0.79 	 The only light in the film comes from artificial sources, and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless.<br /><br />The end of the film, where Thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into Soylent Green wafers, is both chilling, and oddly drama-less.
0.99 	 In the end, the Soylent minions hunt Thorn down, but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to Chief Hatcher.
0.58 	 If your going to make a comedy, make it funny.
0.63 	 please.
0.76 	 The acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done.
0.63 	 Other acting is fine.
0.97 	 The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.<br /><br />Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story.
1.0 	 It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.<br /><br />Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent.
0.9 	 If there was a scale below 1, it would get a -10, following in the footsteps of Godspell.
0.99 	 Saving grace: kudos for era costuming.
0.87 	 Does he match the fifty/fifty rate some claim for Chabrol?
0.58 	 Do we see here too much or too little Miike?
0.71 	 Others here will hit on most of them, though not perhaps Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural.
0.81 	 Only once, when Yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arms, did One Missed Call startle me a little.<br /><br />One other point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (looks like Christopher Walken) as the detective.
0.99 	 That said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a TV mini-series.
0.87 	 Has anyone been able to buy this movie?
0.73 	 Do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster?
0.99 	 Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.<br /><br />That's it, folks.
1.0 	 You can count about 10 clichÃ©s that the film is building up to, but it only delivers on about three of them, and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot.
0.95 	 Recommended if you've just seen something really stupid, and want to rebuild your faith!
0.91 	 The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous.
0.7 	 I loved Honey, I shrunk the Kids when I was little.
0.94 	 It was an original story and had such an exciting plot!
1.0 	 The sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company.
0.78 	 But when Wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way.
0.99 	 The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree.
0.77 	 Steven Vasquez directed and co-wrote with James Townsend, the star, this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions: make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller.
0.86 	 The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder.
0.73 	 It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film.<br /><br />Devon (James Townsend) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna (Sarah Kelly) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian (Alex Wilson) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level.
1.0 	 They bond, Devon comes out, and the mysteries begin: boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devon's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Dan Swett) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon's consoling mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship.
0.96 	 It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl McDougle) who apparently is investigating the missing boys... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick.
0.99 	 And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc.<br /><br />Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye (and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently!)
0.96 	 But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level.
0.99 	 Maybe their next one will be more polished.
0.76 	 Grady Harp
0.98 	 I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it.
0.79 	 What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head.
0.82 	 The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell.
0.8 	 Is there a big wave?
0.5 	 A tsunami?
0.61 	 Is it the end of the world?
0.66 	 From a wave?
0.63 	 The last wave?
1.0 	 It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife.
0.88 	 Charlie keeps asking him "Who are you?"
0.94 	 and it becomes truly disturbing after a while.
0.6 	 This is a wrong-balanced, non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better.
1.0 	 Sheriff's play "Journey's End" on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theatre, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley.<br /><br />I left the theater shattered.
0.92 	 I am a stage actor and a director myself, so I know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally, as well as psychologically.<br /><br />But what I had just witnessed, came so much to life, that I had chills in my spine as I left.<br /><br />None of these emotions came to life, while watching "Aces High", the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen, in cooperation with R.C.
0.95 	 Sheriff himself, shortly before he died.<br /><br />The screen adaptation takes place in the skies over France.
0.64 	 So, gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with.<br /><br />The only plus of the movie, are the aerial battle scenes, which look dated in their special effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen.<br /><br />Granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in trenches, and not in the sky, but that was the "German" vision on things, if one would like to be picky on such things.<br /><br />"Journey's End" is just the other side of the medal, and would have made it into a great movie, if they had left it alone and intact.<br /><br />The transfer on DVD is poor, even though in Widescreen and adapted for 16:9 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater.
0.99 	 It sports various defects, such as minor scratches and dots, although the copy, for the rest, is clean.<br /><br />If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old-timers, then this is a picture for you.
0.88 	 But I rather would suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although that too, is a movie filled with inaccuracies.<br /><br />For the rest of you, who love good acting and drama, I would leave this one out.
0.97 	 Buy the play.
0.81 	 Dubious because in the original play, none of the men we come to know and sympathize with, stay alive.
0.65 	 Then, suddenly, total peace and silence.
0.97 	 The curtain comes up.
0.89 	 Lights.
0.64 	 And here they all are.
0.81 	 Obedient corpses...<br /><br />Far more interesting and far more shocking than "Aces High" finale, which is also dragged by the hair.<br /><br />It is up to you to judge.<br /><br />For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do so, I would take the play and develop it, the way it was meant.
0.85 	 Adding here and there some action scene in the field, just to visualize the "outer" horror and slaughter going on in the "vasty fields of France", around the men involved, but then, just strictly concentrating on what is going on, in that tiny "shack" at the edge of sanity and the world...<br /><br />Want such a movie?<br /><br />Then ask for it.<br /><br />This is not it.
0.79 	 I saw this movie back in 1984, we first started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep.
0.95 	 So we went instead to see this movie.
0.55 	 If you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head, you will want to watch this one.
0.54 	 <br /><br />The question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are: Do you think the government would be capable of doing this?
0.95 	 A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal?
0.83 	 How talented do you have to be to do this?
0.98 	 I know she has a Martha-Stewart-esquire empire.
0.51 	 Brycer?
0.72 	 Who has that kind of time?!
0.95 	 The photographs Mario took of the village were also unnerving.
0.81 	 The second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and I'm still not sure what was going on there.
0.87 	 All in all, watchable but not even close to being a favorite.
0.95 	 I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager.
0.96 	 I loved every word.
1.0 	 It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing.
0.5 	 I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under "GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS."
0.96 	 (That's the Library of Congress subject heading.)
0.95 	 So they handed it to Gus Van Sant.
0.98 	 It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy.
1.0 	 His clout allowed him to hire the very best.
0.99 	 And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny.
0.98 	 Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.7 	 well, SEXY!!!
0.97 	 He's more like Hugh Hefner!
0.96 	 He's a randy old goat and he knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean.
0.97 	 <br /><br />JOHN HURT as "THE COUNTESS."
0.77 	 Okay, he's a gay friendly man.
1.0 	 You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role.
0.9 	 For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad.
0.8 	 "Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely.
1.0 	 But that was BLACK humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.<br /><br />RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean."
1.0 	 Except that in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving.
0.99 	 As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it like this.
0.96 	 "God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."
0.51 	 Did you read this book?
1.0 	 <br /><br />UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw."
0.99 	 This is a tough role.
0.98 	 Still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures.
0.96 	 Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia.
0.95 	 I don't know how anyone could hate this movie.
0.89 	 It's not your typical alien movie.
1.0 	 These aliens are so stupid and confused.
0.56 	 You need to rent it at least once.
0.93 	 Douglas is the one who is framed.
0.89 	 Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't.
0.88 	 A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and...that's it.
0.63 	 I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service.
0.77 	 I hope not.<br /><br />I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.
0.56 	 I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided.
0.92 	 Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said.
0.6 	 Kind of weird.
0.71 	 Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage?
0.93 	 <br /><br />Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good.
0.96 	 I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero.
0.91 	 The "little-people" also play a big part in the movie, especially when they are drunk.
0.82 	 If i keep going, i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that, just go and get the movie and you will not regret.
0.78 	 The film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic.<br /><br />Much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big, this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers.
0.98 	 The owner of the club is frustrated with the Kid's arrogance and little does the Kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival.
1.0 	 From Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat."
0.61 	 Me too.
0.97 	 "Welcome to the party, pal.
1.0 	 "<br /><br />In the truly superb Hong Kong crime drama, known by its English title as "Breaking News," there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot.
0.99 	 And so the hot shot good-guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf, so that the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls.<br /><br />There's also a half-hearted attempt at creating a "love interest" between one of the 'visiting cops' and the sole female 'visiting cop'.<br /><br />The visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the Triad gangster leader, who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries ( Biehn, Maggie Q, and some others ).
1.0 	 It really is the perfect time for this one.
1.0 	 If you want to see a thrilling action movie, don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through.
0.95 	 However, if you want a good laugh, please watch it!
1.0 	 I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night.
0.96 	 In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall.
1.0 	 Gotta love it.
0.64 	 Also Farentino's charac.
0.99 	 would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship.
0.9 	 IN HEAVEN'S NAME!
0.97 	 The restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for a much better film.
0.72 	 We now know that Baby Face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age.
0.99 	 Meng Lo plays yet another bad ass.
0.9 	 Any chop socky fan can apperciate this.
0.97 	 The only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart.
0.81 	 But Jerry flounders at his desk job, and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family, he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty.
0.94 	 But beware: You should avoid colorized version of this film, and see it in black-and-white if you can.
0.68 	 The color is bright, garish, and unrealistic, and in many scenes, Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde.
0.83 	 Yikes!
0.96 	 Only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film.
0.57 	 This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream!
0.98 	 Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher?
0.54 	 It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress?
0.99 	 I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti?
0.87 	 She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life.
1.0 	 She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man.
0.99 	 Nothing more, nothing less.
0.84 	 The movie's prime flaw is the slow pace which might test the patience of a lot of young viewers.
0.94 	 I had a recent spectator experience with The Perfect Witness (2007) because the NetFlix computer recommendation engine suggested I watch this film.
1.0 	 Apparently, at some point, I told it how much I liked Michael Haneke's, Benny's Video.
0.94 	 I don't know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over Thomas C. Dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse.
0.94 	 "), but he's a "filmmaker" or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be Johns in the seedy back alleys of Philadelphia with his DVX 100B.
0.77 	 Also, we've got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up, real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it, backwards, just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest Âsame guy who just now calls himself a "poet.
0.7 	 "I'm an artist," "I'm a filmmaker."
0.97 	 And go ahead, you can wear all the accrutements of a "creative" but don't expect us top respond to you, to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down Wes Bentley's career.
0.99 	 My guess is history will eventually have say something about that Âlike, probably that's in not is good as you think it is.
0.66 	 And yeah, odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma, end up like our man Micky here in The Perfect Witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand.
0.98 	 Great.
0.99 	 The intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation, and lack of serious argument are obvious, and stunning.
1.0 	 This is a Michael Moore film without the humor or the film-making acumen combined with a Richard Dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor.
0.59 	 Skip it.
0.58 	 22 times??
1.0 	 )<br /><br />Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best movie I've seen since 'Citizen Kane'".
0.81 	 That pretty much says it all - and serves as a dire warning!<br /><br />What are the ingredients for a sure-fire cinematic disaster, and one that will haunt you, never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain?
0.96 	 For the "art"?!?
0.98 	 This is quite an achievement.
0.83 	 Stillborn.
0.81 	 But as it that weren't enough, she sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs Â you know, the kind that enabled the Mariah Careys, the Celine Dions, and the Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air-waves for decades now.
0.79 	 The way she looks in this movie, well
 it cannot be described in words.
0.51 	 E.T.
0.77 	 She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015.
0.78 	 She looks HORRIBLE.<br /><br />The songs.
0.67 	 Particularly "Papa Can You Hear Me Squeel Like A Demented Female Walrus In Heat?"
0.98 	 and "Tomorrow Night I'll Prepare the Sequel, YENTL 2: THE RETURN OF THE BITCH".<br /><br />Did you know that Streisand considered having a nose-job early on in her career, but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change?
0.7 	 Killing two flies with one swipe, that's what it would have been.<br /><br />If you're interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.<br /><br />SHOULD BARBRA STREISAND FINALLY GO INTO RETIREMENT?
0.97 	 Some story lines do not evolve, they just happen.
0.63 	 The wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes!
0.88 	 Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mom, her son, and trying to keep all their lives together.
0.94 	 "White Noise" had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since "The Exorcist" I think.
0.93 	 Seeing as EVP is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact.
1.0 	 Not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people.
0.52 	 Someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but it makes us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do.
0.89 	 We need the old days back, the blood and gore days, the Freddy Kruger, the Jason, The Mike Myers days.
0.56 	 It was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified.<br /><br />As such, "Zabriskie Point" may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters may be one-sided and predictable.
0.99 	 Even the anti-establishment students are as inauthentic as the gov't they rebel against.
1.0 	 It is Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the world's most beautiful blond is a redhead!
0.85 	 (Who needs it???)
0.9 	 Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrich's films (and I have seen most, including "Pittsburgh") this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching.
0.58 	 The color photography is OK (this is a very early Technicolor release), but to no purpose.
0.85 	 The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived.
0.88 	 Yet another example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film?
0.82 	 Highly unrecommended.
0.52 	 just below the surface lies what?
0.91 	 now that's smart.
0.54 	 menace?
0.63 	 foreboding?
0.81 	 sexual tension?
0.56 	 do yourself a favour and give this a miss.
0.69 	 The story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the Valley of the Kings, of King Seti I, second pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty, New Kingdom period.
0.52 	 It is not a bad yarn, and a great deal of the film is shot on location.
0.86 	 Even the scenes in the Winter Palace Hotel lobby in Luxor were really shot there, and not in a studio.
1.0 	 Frank Langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated Egyptian.
0.61 	 He should take it up as a sideline.
0.72 	 Having started life as a model at the age of ten, what hope could there be for her?
0.71 	 And to think that this film was directed by Franklin Shaffner, who won an Oscar for 'Patton'!
0.88 	 She takes a taxi to Giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids, gushes in ecstasy: 'But they're so BIG!!!!'
0.62 	 Barf!
0.55 	 Elements of the story are sound.
0.78 	 True!
1.0 	 It was fun to see the name of Cyril Swern as sound recordist on the film, as I knew him pretty well long ago.
1.0 	 Stanley Kubrick's step-daughter Katharina is described as 'draughtswoman'.
0.87 	 Anyway, the antiquities in the film are pretty good, actually.
1.0 	 And we get to see lots of the Cairo Museum and numerous scenic locations.
0.87 	 They actually go inside King Tutankhamun's Tomb!
0.84 	 But there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic, one being the cacophony of traffic noise of Cairo, which is accurately rendered in the background, and would make anyone who knows Cairo chuckle nervously.
0.86 	 Also, the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time, another touch of authenticity.
0.53 	 It could have been good.
0.98 	 1st watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary, yet sadistic(which makes sense) portrayal of a relative of the Marquis De Sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did.
0.99 	 This Tobe Hooper film really doesn't do a whole lot different than his similar in style Freddy Krueger movies with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a dual role(the Marquis De Sade and his relative).
0.58 	 The Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most.
0.82 	 This is such a film.
1.0 	 Trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and I think the film is best understood while taking drugs--it's that incomprehensible.<br /><br />The film begins with some very cute Japanese animation involving a cat.
0.9 	 Oddly, and I don't know why, some see this as a work of genius.
0.98 	 I have begun to melt so I will make this review as short and sweet as possible.<br /><br />There's this astronaut, and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys, ya know?
0.73 	 Except something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back...well, never mind what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut has begun to melt!
0.89 	 Like an ice cream cone in July!
0.84 	 I guess he also checked out the "melting man" handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts ripping people apart.<br /><br />There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need any others?
0.89 	 What's important is WHO will he munch next, and WHAT will be left of them?
0.98 	 The makeup is neat but everything else is...SPLAT
0.57 	 The writing and performances were both first-rate.<br /><br />Sadly, John Ritter died during the series, and it put a damper on things.
0.72 	 They had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members, and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they handled it well.
0.89 	 That was great.<br /><br />*** out of ****
0.9 	 And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story, it is so cookie cutter.
0.8 	 It goes from point A to B with little surprise.
0.99 	 <br /><br />A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes.
0.98 	 Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was "missing the hoop" or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.<br /><br />So...watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie!
0.96 	 Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making.
0.54 	 And he is so handsome it hurts!
0.89 	 But now after so many sad sad movies about the legend, I'm having serious doubts.
0.96 	 And while this one MAY be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (no mean feat there), it's still sad that the best non-documentary film on Bigfoot remains "Harry and the Henriksons" <br /><br />My Grade: D
1.0 	 Call me a walking mail clichÃ© but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs etc.
1.0 	 Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film.
0.96 	 It seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story.
0.51 	 Not that the writing was all the wonderful, rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary "style" prized by those who don't know how to direct).<br /><br />This film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making (which is most of them).<br /><br />Just terrible.
1.0 	 It says a lot about Sundance and what it's become that Victor Vargas was showcased there.
0.97 	 There was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn't bother me.
0.89 	 As for their being no mention of it on the package.
0.99 	 Thats more to do with the silly Excempt from Classification certificate that the BBFC have.
0.94 	 Though there are elements straight out of Elmore Leonard territory, this comes closer to an episode of "Dynasty", since the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - i.e.
0.98 	 Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one.
0.9 	 On the other hand I've studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story.
0.81 	 The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing.
0.68 	 Like throwing in Antonius' marriage to Octavia, and then pushing it aside two scenes later.
0.68 	 And like calling Antonius by his actual name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes.<br /><br />Though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady.
0.98 	 There isn't an ounce of dignity in her.
0.91 	 Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers?
1.0 	 That point is completely immaterial to any argument to be made against this total dog of a movie.<br /><br />I think sports movies fall into two categories; well made movies about the human spirit and competitions, and `By the Sword'.<br /><br />Honestly this movie never could decide what it wanted to be, a touching drama for trying to be your best in life, an indictment of competitive motivation or a martial arts flick.
0.95 	 I liked those movies.
0.71 	 I was too young to remmeber when I first saw this movie.
0.78 	 We quote it at least once a day.
1.0 	 Sure, it's about a really, really drunk millionare that is irresponsible.
0.59 	 The whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie.
0.87 	 Well, out renting movies one weekend i see the box art for this one and see the T-Rex.
0.52 	 Is it me our through out the movie was there scenes clearly spliced from other movies?
0.68 	 Not to mention the Rex's hungry is never satisfied...ever.
0.94 	 This one was hilarious.
0.53 	 I'm not even sure if this was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you will laugh.
0.98 	 OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles...when you cry shouldn't "tears" come out?
1.0 	 You will be writing Mr. Spielberg thank you letters the next day.
0.52 	 This film follows anthropologist Tobias Schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to West Papua and then Peru.
0.99 	 nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism.
0.99 	 (Watch for the graphic circumcision scene).
0.99 	 When questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: "Why Not?"
0.56 	 Who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong?
0.71 	 That said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle.
0.61 	 When I first found out that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie, I wanted to watch.
0.53 	 So I had even more reason to watch.
0.53 	 Well, I watched.
0.91 	 It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies.
0.92 	 But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine once more.
0.94 	 I judge any film, on it's own merits, not by it's source.
0.98 	 I dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers: that it's simply an expanded version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth".
0.87 	 So what?
0.73 	 Not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter (and that COULDN'T possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump), but I think this serial has the World's Record of Stock Footage.
0.94 	 I mean, most of it is stock footage!
0.83 	 And not just from another serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the cool "molten rocks" scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from itself!
0.96 	 The whole "trip to the Moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8!
0.99 	 And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes!
1.0 	 Prepare to see the sunniest Moon ever!
0.87 	 And Moon men that can not breathe on their own world?
0.86 	 The only positive thing I can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everybody has the right to be an hero!
0.99 	 2/10.<br /><br />(BTW, check out the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women's Lib pearl).
1.0 	 I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry.
0.98 	 Maybe it was because the soundtrack(which I listened to before I saw the film) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors) and supposedly dealed within it's script with modern social behaviour, maybe because it's photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical.
0.63 	 Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichÃ¨s I talked about before(those always work, always) and screaming performances(it is a well acted film in it's context)..and by screaming I mean, literally.
1.0 	 Anyway, it is after all, a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).
0.92 	 James Cahill should act in Gay Porno .James is in every scene , he cannot act to save his life .
0.95 	 The film features Eva Longoria who is hot but James can't even score with her !!!!!!!!!
0.87 	 James clearly want's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again .
1.0 	 His martial Arts skills are minimal at best , Some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one .
0.98 	 I've been a fan since his first album.
0.92 	 <br /><br />There are many who have been able to interpret Mr. Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville, and Willie Nelson come to mind, but those people selected for this performance were just awful.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing Leonard Cohen on film that will illustrate his insight, talent, and intelligence.<br /><br />So sad
0.99 	 I have only seen him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer where he played a weak character.
0.71 	 But I think it is well-worth re-watching, which is why I taped it.
0.94 	 And then there's the mistakes they made and have to live with.
0.81 	 I liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to hook us in, but not enough to bog down.
0.55 	 Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life?
0.91 	 Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life?
0.51 	 (Obviously so, since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.)
0.99 	 However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and the Unknown Comic again (although, to make the movie "spicy," they included only his most vulgar routines).
0.65 	 And as someone else has pointed out, this is Phil Hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute).
0.84 	 Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name he was born with.
0.99 	 Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
0.8 	 An uptight voyeur who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad-seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they're off to discover America.
1.0 	 It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release.
0.99 	 Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.<br /><br />The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover.
0.84 	 In a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve.
0.96 	 Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.<br /><br />The swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated.
1.0 	 The love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so.
0.5 	 More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.<br /><br />Not so.
0.63 	 The jarring "workers" scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed.
0.97 	 In these days of 'single mothers' that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true.
0.99 	 At that time I didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had.
0.68 	 I did know who Betty Hutton was, and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic.
0.97 	 Of course, shoot me, I don't like "It's a Wonderful Life" either.
0.94 	 It shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples.
0.99 	 It show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others.<br /><br />In the screening I have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film.
0.72 	 And rightly so.
0.94 	 It has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film.
0.73 	 It is a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste.
0.94 	 It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players.
0.95 	 Turns out, the Judge made the arrangements for the hit-man, because she was divorcing the judge, and threatening to take all his money.
0.95 	 This is all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given away.
0.96 	 After the hit, the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast, but in trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians are killed.
1.0 	 Along the way, the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump, finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man.
0.96 	 But what it lacks in premise, it more than makes up for in acting and realism.
0.94 	 We even get romance (not gratuitous -- just another very real piece of this story).
0.88 	 Even somebody got killed by it.
1.0 	 I have a six month old baby at home and time to time she fights sleep really bad.
0.81 	 She'd rather be in the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy poodle than watch T.V.
0.52 	 I don't know if she will continue to like them in the future but for now she's attached.
0.95 	 An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies.
0.97 	 You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies.
0.87 	 <br /><br />It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having Zizte edited into the movies he is taking about.
0.94 	 For someone who is supposed to know much about movies, his own is, cinematographicly speaking: yeiks.<br /><br />To put it in Zizek's own words - I saw 5\-\!7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />Mr.
0.98 	 I award you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on your soul.
0.6 	 No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.
0.97 	 And not in a fun Jackass way.
0.57 	 Then there's Dracko (Rivas).
0.99 	 Then there's Freya's dad (Lockyer), who plays a dubious role as well.
0.51 	 2/10.
0.77 	 It was funny and sad and yes, the guy Andie MacDowell shagged was hot.
0.79 	 I think my Mum would like it.
0.95 	 I still think they should have been allowed to call it the Sad F**kers Club though...
0.52 	 Or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life.
1.0 	 You can't blame a guy for being a little frightened though.
1.0 	 There are reasons, some valid, some not, and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason.
0.95 	 There is only one problem really.
0.52 	 As Dan, he is also self-deprecating, awkward and scared.
0.9 	 Whether he's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen, unable to stan d still in his anxiety, Dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd.
0.63 	 Would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film?
0.94 	 I can't say.
0.78 	 This show is not clever.
0.97 	 The standout for me was George H.W.
0.72 	 I place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'.
0.78 	 All he does is slightly emulate a Texan accent, and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences.
0.99 	 If you want funny political satire, watch Daily Show/Colbert.
1.0 	 Or look for any political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, since the stop motion action figure animation is EXTREMELY well done.
0.97 	 Priceless
0.99 	 Scenes to make you squeal with delight: montages galore, a strip-tease in a kimono (what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on, instead of take them off?
0.85 	 ), and a climactic battle on skis!
0.62 	 Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL?
0.69 	 Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie.
0.54 	 Nothing is changed nothing is removed.<br /><br />Originally Released as a 3-hour film.
0.72 	 Today B-Movies have larger budgets.
0.99 	 Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without him it would never have been made.
0.55 	 He is a Modesty Blaise fan, and picked a good writer and director.
0.81 	 One of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby, who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community.
1.0 	 The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby.
0.94 	 They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger, and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth.
0.92 	 As an example, there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife.
0.76 	 The camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms.
0.62 	 You get the idea of their desolation and isolation, but not much more.
0.57 	 He plays a uncommunicative man, true, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego, played by Denis Leary.
0.73 	 Kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on Earth.
0.94 	 John Phillip Law plays a forest/park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far, far away.
0.99 	 Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J.
0.98 	 Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
0.99 	 I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat .
0.65 	 My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing.
0.97 	 It isn't like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines, and it's not all comedy and no story.
0.94 	 I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT.
0.98 	 Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable.
0.65 	 It's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.<br /><br />If you took the actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining.
0.95 	 It could have been a better film.
0.83 	 In particular Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez) a grim boarding house keeper, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras) a teacher of an "esperanto" type international language.
0.89 	 It was Bacall's second film, and (sad to say) almost sank her long career.
0.74 	 Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again, and her star resumed it's ascendancy.<br /><br />It's a bleak film (as was the novel).
0.94 	 But this ain't life but its representation, an imitation of life.
0.94 	 Sirk never tried to show reality, on the contrary.
0.51 	 None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood (most notably Technicolor) to distinguish the artificial from the real thing.
0.79 	 Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else.<br /><br />Another of Sirk's statements summarizes this: `You can't reach, or touch, the real.
0.96 	 One ends up giving up.<br /><br />Therefore, we are in a hall full of mirrors where there's no difference between real and its false copy.
0.99 	 That town ain't real either, with those hideous oil pumps all over the place.
0.77 	 So in this realm the acting is affected, the decore is fake, the trick is visible.
0.68 	 Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit (the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower, for example).
0.99 	 Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time.<br /><br />`The angles are the director's thoughts; the lighting is his philosophy'.
0.92 	 A house that resembles a mausoleum, that no party can cheer up.
0.94 	 Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director's craft.<br /><br />Sirk considered himself a `story bender', because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose.
0.98 	 It wouldn't work in any other hands.<br /><br />The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin, who was for 50's comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama.
0.67 	 Now we regard them as `cult' or `bizarre', because we are not those spectators anymore.
0.74 	 That is why Todd Haynes's homage `Far from heaven' turns into a pastiche, because it reproduces Sirk's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between.
0.97 	 I absolutely agree and I'm sure the parallel is not incidental.
0.56 	 If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO.
0.8 	 Drugging her up, Randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her, whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms.
0.56 	 Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith is Lavelle, in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a Senator.
0.99 	 The prison is appropriately crummy and the girls, despite being quite attractive, look the part of desperate inmates longing, yearning from the very pits of their souls, to escape such horrid entrapment.
0.99 	 As you might expect, you get naked women in showers, prisoner in solitary, a cat fight, shootouts, attempted escapes which go awry, and other exploitative elements(..such as a horrifying shock therapy session, not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of Belle).
0.59 	 Interesting enough, Demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension, understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.
0.53 	 In comparing this to Serial Mom, Mr.
0.67 	 This is not nearly as polished.<br /><br />There is a dark side here.
0.99 	 I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great.
1.0 	 I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending.
1.0 	 All the stories were great though.
0.91 	 When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it's telling you something.....4 of 10.
0.88 	 Even the Visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen.
0.76 	 If you haven't gotten into BSG, @ least try this & I'll bet you become a fan & will want to see how the BSG story came to be.
1.0 	 Every once in a while, a group of friends, with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent, will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm.
0.99 	 Except for two:<br /><br />Firstly, it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film, as sported by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies).
1.0 	 Given this, and the excellent Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie, you would be expecting a odd, and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience.
1.0 	 The beginning is intriguing what with it's small town spooky atmosphere.
0.99 	 From that moment on the whole atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is ruined.For those of you who have seen it, who can ever forget good old Johnny screaming out "COP KABOB!!"
0.64 	 I can't believe they got the rights to that Santo & Johnny song.
0.8 	 This film was cutting edge for its day.
0.58 	 The films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us.<br /><br />The underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film.
0.96 	 I consider myself a "Roosevelt Democrat", but would appreciate a bit more subtlety.<br /><br />Of course, the problem could be with me.
0.88 	 <br /><br />The only thing that kept me from giving this a "1" was the nice scenery, human and plant.
0.85 	 **** out of ****
1.0 	 I don't know how or why this film has a meager rating on IMDb.
0.71 	 The film that Vilgot is making.
0.52 	 It's about a young woman named Lena(IE.
0.84 	 "Blue" is not a sequel at all.
0.84 	 IMDb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one.
0.99 	 BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie.
0.93 	 the special effects.......well good lord Bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie.
0.96 	 I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class from 4 years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better movie than this.
0.82 	 They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop.
0.65 	 I DO however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals.
0.81 	 If you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you whatsoever.<br /><br />On a final thought: How in the world are there 7 movies ranked BELOW this on IMDb?
0.92 	 The story is typical mystery material: killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease.
0.94 	 Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there's only so much he can do with a TV budget and the network censors on his back.
0.99 	 Unfortunately, as this is made for TV, the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found.
1.0 	 If you're in the mood for a film like this, I've some excellent suggestions: pick up a copy of Dario Argento's "Deep Red"(my highest recommendation; superb film), "Opera", or even "Tenebre".
0.92 	 They're stronger in every category.
0.54 	 Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie.
0.99 	 Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun".
0.94 	 If comedy is your thing, watch away.
0.93 	 Of course this is in my opinion.
0.51 	 In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was well-written and the story, at times, was interesting.
0.99 	 However, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel.
0.7 	 It's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.
0.95 	 OK, here it is: "Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama."
0.79 	 Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly.
0.97 	 Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of Lhasa in 1943, speak perfect English, also with dubious accents.
1.0 	 Of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now-reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west.
1.0 	 We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader.
0.9 	 In other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves donÂ´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go.
0.7 	 Eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in Egypt.
0.83 	 Really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century.
1.0 	 I also didn't realize the series flopped.
1.0 	 It is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time.
0.73 	 The first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but that is to be expected from any show.
0.78 	 I have become a BIG BAD SWIM groupie, tracking it to film festivals whenever & wherever I can.
0.87 	 I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it!
0.66 	 Tom Wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill.
0.76 	 <br /><br />It is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start.
0.8 	 Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific people -- whether real or fictional straw men -- who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer.
0.76 	 Hello, I was alanrickmaniac.
0.68 	 I'm a Still Crazy-holic.
0.95 	 It was just another movie I watched partly on TV.
0.64 	 Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends.
0.97 	 Then on several film posters and the film script.
0.95 	 Right now it has become that worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and Still Crazy parties.
0.94 	 <br /><br />How could that happen?
0.96 	 Or don't.
0.52 	 I'm addicted to this film.
0.93 	 Will all of you please lay the hell off Todd Sheets!?!
0.8 	 Let's give you $30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with!
1.0 	 Sure the acting is laughable at times.
0.99 	 There are holes in the plot, yes.
1.0 	 The plot does seem far-fetched.
0.97 	 I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to.
0.89 	 Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that.
1.0 	 When I look back on my college days at Ohio University, there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories.
0.89 	 Channel 23 is OU's local access channel and until the last few years, pretty much played anything they were sent.
0.97 	 This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then scanning pictures of them online, to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs.<br /><br />However, the king, in my opinion, of the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater.
0.78 	 My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was complete, I don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened.
0.76 	 Its sort of like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk.
0.99 	 Plus, I desperately want the Theme to Midnight Skater.
1.0 	 Kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it.
1.0 	 Sweet God I love that song.
1.0 	 I have to say that the locations look good and Franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there.
0.95 	 Jess Franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money, and overall I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works.
0.92 	 In today's world of digital fabrication, there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer.
0.96 	 I wonder if this movie was made for TV?
0.98 	 Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, poorly written, horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing I own (no small statement, friends).
0.61 	 For me nothing compares 2 U, Pia... and I don't suppose I'm the only one who's ever felt this way!
0.97 	 With really nothing else he can do, he decides that for once he's going to lie.
0.99 	 It's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation.
0.72 	 It's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt, have at least been morally compromised like Michael.
0.8 	 But where do i find it?
0.55 	 If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975, Go WATCH IT.
0.83 	 If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character, it would still be worth a watch.
0.64 	 Ajay Devgan(Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think, they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days.
0.99 	 Sushmita Sen carries herself well, with grace and make-up.
0.51 	 :)
0.7 	 Watching CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses, it isn't any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV--but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine).
1.0 	 A single mother, grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident.
0.93 	 Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid.
0.97 	 "...no, genius, it's from "Citizen Kane"!).
0.52 	 Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death.
0.7 	 She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits), but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way.
0.99 	 This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat, "It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there".
0.84 	 The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS.
0.84 	 <br /><br />In the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane, and Tower Two's subsequent fall, you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby.
0.66 	 that was definitely some serious in-depth reviewing there.
0.76 	 By the end, I actually shed a few tears.<br /><br />It seems to be in the nature of most old films to drag for 7/8th length and then catch fire right at the end.
0.84 	 You see, to earlier audiences, what are to us the "slow parts" were the main body of the story.
0.87 	 Well, that isn't going to happen.
0.91 	 Think about it for a minute or two.
0.87 	 It's not some high-tone universal abstract plea for forgiveness; it's a plea from one dimwit, and those who feel sorry for the big lummox, for a little mercy.
1.0 	 It's that personal, and that embarrassingly naked an appeal.
0.8 	 For after being mad at Gypo, irritated at him, thinking this is the dumbest character of all time, you finally find yourself won over by the scene of Gypo's erstwhile girlfriend pleading to another woman to talk her man into going easy him.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The film may be sentimental, but the sentimentality is not cheap as some here have charged.
0.9 	 And the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours, if you are reading this.
0.76 	 Perfect metaphor for this film really.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The photography of Skye is beautiful though, but then Stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.
0.65 	 It's set in 'contemporary' Africa, (it was made in 1979), and is about the slave trade.
0.71 	 Richard Fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone.
0.9 	 Nicolas Roeg ?
1.0 	 He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW didn`t he ?
0.92 	 This doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth .
0.71 	 It proves my theory about "star power."
0.59 	 )<br /><br />-Zaphoid<br /><br />PS: My theory about "star power" is: the more "star power" used in a show, the weaker the show is.
0.71 	 Another way to look at it is: "more is less.
0.66 	 ")<br /><br />-Z
0.87 	 Someone please convince Leno to do a sequel!
0.85 	 Dingman's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies.
0.96 	 I won't ruin it for you, but it makes the explosion of the Death Star pale in comparison.
0.87 	 Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta.
0.98 	 Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him.
0.94 	 Thats been done already!<br /><br />I really think Alec Baldwin should just stick to being Kim Bassinger's husband.<br /><br />Right after the movie ended, TNT showed the 1959 movie, Trail at Nuremberg.
0.93 	 That movie is FAR superior.
1.0 	 And many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it.<br /><br />Babaganoosh!
0.67 	 In what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 I've had to endure in a long time, Al Pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure.
0.99 	 Not his usual typecasting, which was nice.
0.74 	 Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on TV or in earlier films.
0.84 	 Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have you believe "Once Hollywood has you, you can't get out."
0.89 	 Overpopulation, air pollution, year-long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule.
0.8 	 The only hope comes from a food product called Soylent Green.
0.9 	 But what is this particular food stuff really made of?
0.81 	 As it turns out, Cotten was on the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing.
0.78 	 Heston believes that this wasn't just a garden-variety murder, that Cotten was bumped off for a reason.
0.62 	 What Robinson finds out about Soylent Green shocks him beyond all imagination; but before he can tell Heston all of what he knows, he has himself euthanized.
0.98 	 This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look like a masterpiece.
0.74 	 Why would a person go back to a person, who kicks them in the teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again.<br /><br />This film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse (not just forgive it, but fully accept it).
0.96 	 I obviously wasn't embracing my inner masochist.<br /><br />As Bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many wonderful aspects to this film; however, in order to justify the reunion of Eli and Tom, more character development would have been helpful.
0.91 	 We are never acquainted with Eli's masochism, in fact, we are led to believe that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is highly evident.
0.66 	 This movie is interessant.
0.96 	 Little Tree's education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you.
0.71 	 Readin' 'Ritin' and 'Rithmetic?
0.64 	 Oh my gosh.
0.98 	 He should learn to adapt to new discipline.
0.6 	 Those were the times!
0.96 	 Little Tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right.
0.79 	 It's quite easy to identify with him...<br /><br />The screenplay is sloppy/non-existent.
0.93 	 I had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel...so invariably my expectations were crushed.
0.84 	 The scene at Bishop Myriel's was fine.
0.6 	 In fact, other than the galleys, things survived up until the dismissal of Fantine.
0.99 	 Valjean is able to fetch Cosette for Fantine before the Champmathieu affair, so they reunite happily, yet another change.
1.0 	 After this three minutes of accuracy, however, the movie again begins to hurtle towards Classic Novel Butchering.<br /><br />As Cosette and Valjean are riding through the park, they come across Marius giving a speech at a meeting.
0.98 	 When he comes to hand out fliers to Valjean and Cosette, he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the TV set.
0.57 	 OF COURSE THEY ARE REVOLUTIONARIES!
0.7 	 It's a historical FACT that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832.
0.98 	 <br /><br />At one point Cosette goes to give Marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets Eponine.
0.59 	 Or at least not the Eponine of the book.
0.64 	 This Eponine appears to be a well-to-do secretary girl working for the prison reformers (who are working out of the Cafe Universal as opposed to the Cafe Musain).
0.51 	 <br /><br />The rest of the movie is sort of accurate, except that Javert's suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation.
0.99 	 The movie ends with Valjean watching Javert jump into the river.
0.59 	 The elimination of Fantine's suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her.
0.92 	 That Cosette knows Valjean's past from the start messes with the plot a good deal.
0.97 	 I did not even see Thenardier, and Mme.
0.99 	 The same with Gavroche.
0.73 	 I did like Frederich March's interpretation of Valjean a lot, however, which was one of the redeeming features of the movie.
1.0 	 On the other hand, Charles Laughton, for all his great acting in other movies, seems to have missed the mark with Javert.
1.0 	 The author of numerous novels, plays, and short stories, W. Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) was considered among the world's great authors during his lifetime, and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public.
0.97 	 Published in 1944, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is the tale of a World War I veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values.
1.0 	 It was Maugham's last major novel--and it was immensely popular.
0.9 	 Given that the novel's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues, it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version--but Darryl F. Zannuck of 20th Century Fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication.<br /><br />According to film lore, THE RAZOR'S EDGE was to be directed by the legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Maugham himself--and it does seem that Maugham wrote an adaptation.
1.0 	 Tyrone Power, recently returned from military service during World War II, was cast as the spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell; Gene Tierney, one of the great beauties of her era, was cast as socialite Isabell Bradley.
1.0 	 The supporting cast was particularly notable, including Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson, and Elsa Lanchester.
1.0 	 Both budget and shooting schedule were lavish, and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike.<br /><br />But time has a way of putting things into perspective.
1.0 	 Seen today, THE RAZOR'S EDGE is indeed a beautifully produced film--but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity.
0.73 	 We are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself.
0.99 	 It has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees.<br /><br />We are left with the shell of Maugham's plot, which centers on the relationship between Larry and Isabell, a woman Larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them.
0.98 	 Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent, but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support.
0.91 	 Fortunately, the supporting cast is quite good, with Herbert Marshall, Clifton Webb, and Lucille Watson particularly so; the then-famous performance by Anne Baxter, however, has not worn as well as one would hope.<br /><br />With a running time of just under two and a half hours, the film also feels unnecessarily long.
0.82 	 Regardless of the specific scene, it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, the film has not been remastered, but the print is extremely good, and while the bonus package isn't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor.
0.99 	 When all is said and done, I give THE RAZOR'S EDGE four stars for production values and everyone's willingness to take on the material--but frankly, this a film best left Power and Tierney fans, who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars, and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
1.0 	 I rented this film on Netflix after it won all the Oscars, to see if it was really that good.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrayal (for the most part) of a group of soldier's rotation in Iraq.
0.92 	 What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different attitudes about the war.
0.8 	 It was both unrealistic, and very long.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film was OKAY, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7, was because it was a major letdown for winning Best Picture at the Oscars.
0.99 	 I felt like this film could have been so much better considering Saving Private Ryan lost Best Picture, but was much better than this film.
0.84 	 Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down which only won 2 Oscars.
1.0 	 I honestly do not know how this won best picture.<br /><br />If you are looking for an action packed war flick, rent Black Hawk Down.
0.97 	 I'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible.
0.57 	 Anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of Elk Hills.
0.99 	 The plan goes sour when Aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over Elk Hills after they get rid of all the bad elements.
0.55 	 The first-rate cast of familiar B-feature faces constitutes as a major asset: Victoria Principal as Ben's sweet hottie girlfriend Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as flaky saloon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as the feckless mayor, David Doyle as a slimy bank president, Andrew Stevens as an affable gas station attendant, John Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as one of the 'Nam vets, Anthony Carbone as a smarmy casino manager, John Steadman as a folksy old diner owner, Paul Gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully, and Dick Miller as a talentless piano player.
0.76 	 Moral: Don't hire other people to do your dirty work.
0.84 	 Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to see this film.
0.86 	 I just never got around to watching it.
0.97 	 The plot has nothing that interests me.
0.94 	 I know nothing about soccer (football.)
1.0 	 I am one of those American fools that has no clue.
0.95 	 I had never even seen David Beckham before this film.
0.63 	 I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America.
0.6 	 Enough about me.
0.97 	 <br /><br />Truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven.
0.99 	 I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents.
0.99 	 I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything.
0.99 	 (This is not a criticism of the film!)
0.8 	 Bake finds Sherry working there, while Bilge runs into Connie first when she comes in as a dowdy spinster and then showing up as a glamour girl.
0.57 	 I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie.
1.0 	 <br /><br />This is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be.
0.98 	 I would never have thought I would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound.
0.57 	 Thanks to Martin Scorsese I did (the movie was from F. Borzage).
0.77 	 Gomez has something to do with this.
0.99 	 However, the film doesn't try to guilt trip you.
0.58 	 The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, gritty, and ugly life and it's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of Joe in this film does.
0.99 	 Anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous, awkward, and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that.
0.99 	 The sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be.
0.51 	 They are not graphic, but they are realistic, and that's what people should keep in mind when they view this film.
1.0 	 The course language that is used in the film, particularly the word "fag" is used effectively and is not gratuitous.
0.94 	 They have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual.
1.0 	 Welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack.
0.66 	 Where we'll see, That's right.
0.56 	 and that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN.
0.52 	 nah.
0.86 	 REALLY sadly that was the best part of the movie.
0.86 	 They dressed her up in a dress, he gets kidnapped, then released, he runs back to the house, then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends?
0.81 	 In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I do like Whoopi.
0.75 	 And the dinosaur craze.
0.98 	 I didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running.
0.57 	 Whether or not it was rated as "good" or not doesn't really matter to me.
1.0 	 And no, I'm not a juvenile.
1.0 	 Nor am I a moron.
0.69 	 On a positive note, the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well.
1.0 	 Looks like the production budget was very generous as well.
0.93 	 The film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories, a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action.
0.94 	 At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity.For a good reason!
0.98 	 Oh well,it is a bit of a change of pace in late Victorian London.A bit of sixgun law:-)
0.95 	 It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days.
0.99 	 My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot, Margarita Levieva.
0.99 	 She doesn't have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful.
1.0 	 It makes me sad that there can be people such as Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world w/no redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty.
0.71 	 I'd recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable.
0.98 	 Here's hoping this makes her career, & if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years.
0.58 	 The stooges are always funny when they cook.
0.92 	 They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending, but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars.
0.97 	 The ENTIRE MOVIE is flashbacks from the first Boogeyman movie as well as, inexplicably, footage from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love film Brainwaves.
0.59 	 Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structure--all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot, and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them.
0.64 	 The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot, and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH.
0.98 	 The typical argument is that the latter film is over-long: at almost two and a half hours, this is certainly a valid criticism to make.
0.85 	 And yet, something just doesn't hang together quite right.
0.66 	 It feels almost as if the script was pored over, and *every* single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted, and that's exactly what happened.
0.97 	 No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up... and that's probably the film's biggest weakness.
0.91 	 It has 16 numbers (give or take a few), and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra, this really starts to turn one numb after a while.
0.98 	 You might well feel that each song, each dance, can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking... and that's true.
0.99 	 But that's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place.<br /><br />All this long preamble doesn't mean there's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH.
0.81 	 And the *dancing*--again, the film suffers from the 'too much of a good thing spoils the effect' syndrome, as it does with Sinatra's singing.
0.79 	 But once again, if it's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe, or tapping across the screen in a sailor's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief... might as well err on the side of overdoing it!
0.99 	 I must say that I really had no idea that I was going to sit down and watch this movie.
0.98 	 I guess it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between class.
0.94 	 I really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film.
0.92 	 But, something about this movie really did it for me.
0.76 	 I would now see myself as a huge fan.
0.59 	 Give it a chance, it won't let you down.
0.96 	 Jane Â "poor, plain and little" Â grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt, her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school.
0.93 	 She arrives as a governess in the household of Mr Rochester, utterly friendless and alone.
0.89 	 Rochester is the caged tiger, busy "paving hell with energy"; potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him Â but "pervious, through a chink or two".
0.92 	 I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy.
1.0 	 Only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial.
0.95 	 what a relief to find out I am not imagining this programme!
0.93 	 Maybe I am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune, but at least I now know it is not just me.
1.0 	 The movie had a cute opening, I truly believed I was in for one of the best romantic comedies i've seen in a while... there was something particular "foreign" about the way the movie was set up, realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical.
1.0 	 The most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every 'likable' character.
0.86 	 A scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the "woman of his dreams" only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on- lookers.
0.66 	 Come on.
0.75 	 In the end, the 'good guys' win, 'bad guys' loose... You get the picture.
0.8 	 A WASTE of a potentially interesting movie.
1.0 	 With that magnificent sonorous voice of his, Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in.<br /><br />He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film.
0.81 	 the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice...that's it.
0.54 	 And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews, you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching.
0.61 	 My advice is to stay far away from this film, if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek.
0.99 	 Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week.
0.59 	 Since Melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to hook up with her, but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die.<br /><br />To be honest the real reason I wanted to watch this film is because Dana Kimmel of Friday The 13th pt 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie.
0.99 	 After over an hour, only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way.<br /><br />The movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s, the movie suffers from being too dark at times.
0.57 	 She offers him double to kill Wayne.
0.76 	 Viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a TV movie but it's bigger than that.
0.61 	 The slick, slowly-timed direction, moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the DVD on a big HDTV.<br /><br />The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo.
0.96 	 It's tragic, and you know she's going to end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do.
0.98 	 Totally empty.
0.95 	 The "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.<br /><br />It's a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema.
0.88 	 I was waiting to see this movie from a long time.
0.69 	 The acting is really spell binding though I think Esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself.
0.71 	 it's so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable.
0.98 	 WOW - and there are plenty more examples like that.
0.99 	 oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot/Cool hand Luke)
0.74 	 When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen.
0.58 	 I've heard complaints about the weird insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie.
0.86 	 The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions.
0.99 	 Even the worst hypocrite of them all, the archbishop, leaves us with the thought that "Of course, she was innocent.
1.0 	 She had no idea what she was saying, no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church.
0.98 	 Unschooled, she had no idea of what the church's stand on such matters even was.
0.83 	 Why?
0.97 	 They used gas jets in the movie, and 2 of them were stopped up.
0.77 	 Suddenly, the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her.
0.78 	 Thankfully for her, they didn't have to repeat the shot as it was SO realistic: she WAS being burned!!
0.66 	 He also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death, you don't want to be around to watch them die.
0.91 	 We Christians, even the most anti-Semitic have no problem with falling back on the Old Testament when it comes to capital punishment, even though it was overridden by Jesus' words.
0.89 	 Bring on public executions like this little girl's.
0.81 	 Smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls' senses.<br /><br />The only little 'pick' I have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite, even to the point of madness.
0.93 	 You gotta wonder!
0.77 	 !<br /><br />If ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logic-tight compartments, this is one.
0.78 	 First of all I saw this movie without knowing anything about it I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me.
0.98 	 The characters are believable and interesting.
0.99 	 One wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong.<br /><br />All the characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians.
0.84 	 What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!!
0.83 	 Usually I don't like dramas.
0.94 	 This movie captured my attention minute by minute and I even did not like "The pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because i did not like the acting of Will's son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors, I saw him also last night in "The day the earth stood still" and I confirmed my sensation that Jaden can't act).
0.69 	 If you have a minimum of heart you'll don't regret watching it
0.61 	 The story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight.
0.73 	 I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them.
0.85 	 Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well.
0.94 	 Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives.
0.83 	 As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination.
0.73 	 Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen.
0.61 	 Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies.
0.99 	 This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why "La La land" is so named.
0.79 	 His final victim is to be the daughter of the ferryman.....he concentrates his wrath not only on those directly involved in his fate but their relatives as well.<br /><br />Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma that passes for her acting style.
0.99 	 But who's complaining?
0.61 	 It's not the story that is the major attraction but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general moodiness of the piece.
0.94 	 I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable.
0.78 	 Judge for yourself.
0.94 	 When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body.
0.75 	 Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk.
1.0 	 <br /><br />This virus is very intelligent.
0.79 	 The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM.
0.9 	 The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I've had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL.
0.98 	 I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and I didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games.
1.0 	 (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie?
0.64 	 What?)
0.91 	 I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do?
0.93 	 Some years ago, satellite channel U.K. Gold promoted repeats of 'Men Behaving Badly' with the hype: "Here it is, the original flat-sharing sitcom!".
1.0 	 This was in fact untrue.
0.98 	 But there must be no naughty business.
0.98 	 She was not alone.
0.69 	 Mortimer and Cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it.<br /><br />Richard O'Sullivan was still playing 'Bingham' in I.T.V.
0.61 	 's 'Doctor In Charge' when this got started.
0.82 	 George had lost interest in sex, but Mildred had not.
0.79 	 He worked so well he was made into a regular.<br /><br />Within a year of its debut, there was the inevitable movie spin-off.
0.93 	 I am not a big fan of the 'Man About The House' movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen.
0.93 	 It reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the 1940s and '50s, complete with ray guns and ridiculous science.
0.61 	 You must watch this movie!
0.99 	 As soon as I began to see posters and hear talk about this movie, I was immediately excited.
1.0 	 The Matrix was an incredible to behold and I couldn't wait to see the second one, especially after beginning to see the trailers for it at other movies.
1.0 	 While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as always, there simply were too few of them.
0.74 	 Unless you're a psychology major, you most likely will not understand most of what is said in the movie, and because of that simply won't care.
1.0 	 It became somewhat of a romantic movie with the showing of events happening in the lives and relationship of Neo and Trinity.
0.98 	 What movie ends with "To Be Concluded"?
0.6 	 How original is that folks.
0.95 	 Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue?
0.61 	 Akshay's minuscule role has also put him at par with Amitabh.
0.86 	 I didn't understand what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie.<br /><br />There were a few loose points in the script; like; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city.
0.96 	 Kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague.
0.98 	 How can the family of such a big don doesn't have any security cover?
0.65 	 He made this a father-son movie to remember.
0.57 	 Failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try.
0.99 	 Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.<br /><br />I thought the movie was OK...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.<br /><br />Ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it?
0.63 	 <br /><br />I hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
0.91 	 It worked really well at doing that.
0.57 	 That's all this is.
0.85 	 Cheese.
0.92 	 Why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy?
0.84 	 I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!!
0.6 	 Does that sound good?
0.98 	 In a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0.0.
0.59 	 the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word "film" itself.
0.98 	 Torture and watching BEN & ARTHUR.
0.98 	 You know how people always say things like, "Good things come out of everything!"?
0.92 	 It's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own.
0.62 	 There are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there's BEN & ARTHUR.
0.99 	 This is BEN AND ARTHUR.
0.64 	 "It is not an original discovery, by many voice you have (quite off the pitch, by the way), but it departs somewhat from the norm in the Spanish cinema.
1.0 	 The downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined, and while some points are not well developed, others are out of place.
0.75 	 The problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players, therefore we can not identify with the dramatic, and not give us a solid base comic too, leaving everything except pure joke.
0.99 	 Perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do, but that is no excuse to lower our guard.
0.62 	 Any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled, as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that, we presume, they wanted to do, can not afford to have little moments finished successful (beyond bad) as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh, lost drunk, compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him.
0.8 	 It is true that the film by Manuel Gomez Pereira has its hits (some of the moments involving Jose Sacristan), but the whole is a anodyne Story, a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better.
0.66 	 Please.
0.51 	 2210.
0.76 	 the characters.
0.77 	 Hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies!
0.98 	 Mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the 90' mark.
0.61 	 The beautiful sets are here with all that made the Hamer production values a trademark, yet Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect.
0.99 	 It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie!
0.98 	 Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical.
0.79 	 I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes.
0.72 	 So this film isn't for a world audience.
0.94 	 And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I like.
0.99 	 I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie.
0.95 	 My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie.
0.68 	 But I have a thing for westerns, being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this Dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts, as his films go anyway.<br /><br />The film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain, sounding like a blank Marlon Brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast, along with the obligatory cheap looking sets.
0.59 	 ***
1.0 	 Hey genius....triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about Asian culture.
1.0 	 I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end.
1.0 	 I would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development.
0.6 	 I know the movie didn't have the budget of the "Bridges Of Madison County" which I believe was released around the same time.
0.87 	 As someone mentioned, I wish that Miss Spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be.
0.61 	 She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope that she would consider doing the casting too.
0.71 	 The acting was OK, but please, you can really feel the "Straight to Video" feeling.
0.59 	 Gene Hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination.
0.81 	 This film is really something of a curate's egg, good in parts.
0.97 	 I sat through it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands, but if I were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie, I would have to give it the thumbs down, with a few caveats: Jason Behr is good in the part of John Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear, although we are given hints in Livien's well-acted relationship to his parents, but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer (which it shouldn't be).
0.89 	 Nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting, albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film.
0.79 	 At any rate, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derivative about them.
0.73 	 The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me!
0.96 	 This episode is a bit confusing.
0.55 	 Some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but I have to say I was a bit confused from the beginning!<br /><br />Clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of Fairview Mental Institution and is made fun of for believing that he's a superhero.
1.0 	 The doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was, in fact, crazy.
0.98 	 Demons and vampires also didn't exist.
0.98 	 Ned Kelly (Ledger), the infamous Australian outlaw and legend.
1.0 	 Sort of like Robin Hood, with a mix of Billy the Kid, Australians love the legend of how he stood up against the English aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change Australia forever.
0.72 	 If ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was.
0.87 	 (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `Nature in Australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover.
0.5 	 When one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, I myself was wishing I had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!
0.91 	 In a few words there is a lot more sex, nudity and alcohol.
0.84 	 If you enjoy seeing a bunch of dudes making assholes of themselves, go to this movie.
0.83 	 <br /><br />Yes, the movie is very much like "Bend it like Beckham", but I actually think this movie pulls it off better.
0.61 	 This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit .
0.88 	 We get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called R.I.P.L.E.Y.
0.72 	 Patriot Act or not.<br /><br />I don't know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the US.<br /><br />The computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against Will, his mother & Dennis wasn't sanctioned by a Government agency.
0.83 	 We discover that the "guy" who ran into Annie is Falken (not played by the original actor sadly) who faked his own death.<br /><br />We also get to see WOPR as "what's going to help" them beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used back then.
0.87 	 RIPLEY's attack mission against Philadelphia is halted (far too easily in my opinion) and it decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed.
0.74 	 The play isn't great to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as Peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origins (we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc.)
1.0 	 Only Fiona Shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone, even if that performance is as light, truthful and entire as Shaw's.
0.8 	 Ben Kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role as just that.
0.93 	 My only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things.
1.0 	 This movie was great the first time I saw it, when it was called "Lost in Translation."
0.83 	 But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned into Carson, California.
0.5 	 How can a character that wears hundred dollar T-shirts and has never been inside a Target department store expect to give advice to a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant?
0.99 	 Sure, it's cheesy, but who cares?
0.92 	 )<br /><br /> The plot goes like this: After a battle between Fire & Ice, a kings daughter is kidnapped by Jarols (Ice) subhuman creatures, while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her.<br /><br /> Yeah it doesn't sound as a original as Nurse Betty, but that's not the point.
0.67 	 Really.
1.0 	 America are you blind give the award to real shows.
0.95 	 i hate this show along with 30 rock.
0.97 	 thank you CBS.
0.61 	 but keep this show gone and never bring it back.
0.72 	 never ever ever ever.
0.9 	 those are the types of movies or TV shows that i give a one.
0.82 	 the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show.
0.99 	 i don't see why everyone loves it.
0.64 	 my opinion again.
0.99 	 the class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not from watching your show.
0.76 	 also it appeared that he lived by himself... then that he was a foster kid... then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still.
0.58 	 now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus' intently on him for the contingency of the movie.
0.7 	 but i thought the news people said he wasn't... hm...<br /><br />now the movie comes to a close.
0.82 	 are these people in the same situation?
0.89 	 i highly doubt it.
0.78 	 In some of the scenes, I thought out loud...why has he never been approached to play singer/songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic.
0.72 	 The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true.
0.93 	 Death at any turn.
0.69 	 I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through.
0.98 	 In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief.
0.56 	 It's not just Al's career-low performance that hinders the film though: there are numerous other flaws with Revolution, more of which will be said later.<br /><br />Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb (Al Pacino) lives in the north-eastern region of America with his son Ned (Sid Owen/Dexter Fletcher).
1.0 	 He leads a simple life Â living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements.
1.0 	 The country is lorded over by the English colonialists, but during an eight year period (1775-83) a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born.
0.92 	 Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army Â swept away by events they can barely understand, the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another.
1.0 	 Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay (Natassja Kinski), a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry.
0.88 	 Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.<br /><br />Where to start with the film's flaws?
0.5 	 At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along.
0.96 	 The idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy Â that feeling of "being there" in the confusion of battle and musket fire.
0.74 	 The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate.
0.86 	 Action sequences defy belief.
0.68 	 Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set, but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields' character as well as graphic deaths.
0.98 	 It also wants to be a buddy picture, a coming of age picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelogue, and a western.
0.52 	 That it manages to do just fine.
0.99 	 I do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good.
0.97 	 Which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great.
1.0 	 I enjoy the story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models.
1.0 	 Plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.
0.97 	 Most of the French films I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but that's okay.
0.98 	 I found them interesting, well-photographed and with intriguing actors.
0.87 	 )<br /><br />This movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening.
0.99 	 But then it became talk, talk and more talk....which is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery.
0.95 	 Thus, if you love plays, you should like this...but I want a little more bang for a murder story.
0.7 	 The clothing styles, the scenery, and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted.
0.89 	 <br /><br />Plot - in five years, they robbed twenty-seven banks and then vanished without a trace.
0.99 	 Holy crap this is so hysterical!
0.67 	 Why aren't American comedies written like this?
0.74 	 Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot.
0.8 	 I couldn't believe it was the same guy as House!
0.97 	 I couldn't agree more.
0.61 	 There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her top off.
0.51 	 !
0.89 	 While creating an American sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential, it just isn't met here within this show.
0.71 	 Most of the supporting characters aren't fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags.
0.88 	 As in any sitcom, they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to, and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see Bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there because....why?
0.99 	 Keeping them there without any real reason--even the really unbelievable one given by Joanna Cassidy in the very special 2-part abortion episode that has major problems of its own--is where the show just falls apart.
0.63 	 To simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation.
0.97 	 A show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily, but somehow aren't able to.
0.92 	 And that's a fatal error that really killed the program.<br /><br />Chalk it up to a show in its infancy.
1.0 	 Regardless, the show is worth a watch.
1.0 	 With Godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju (giant monster) genre.
1.0 	 Many sought after success; a few gained it.
0.96 	 But unlike Godzilla, Gamera was marketed as a friend to all children, later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril, and thus Gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies.
1.0 	 While the new Gamera movies directed by Shusuke Kaneko are marvelous, revolutionary monster movies, the original series, including the original, is nothing special.<br /><br />The first Gamera movie, titled in Japan as "The Giant Monster Gamera" was clearly a Godzilla want-to-be.
0.91 	 Even though the movie was produced in the era of color films, it was shot in black-and-white.
0.58 	 To imitate the first Godzilla movie from the 1950s.
0.99 	 Gamera also attacks Tokyo.
0.87 	 Because Godzilla attacked Tokyo in the first movie.
0.71 	 I don't know much about the Japanese version, for the version I am familiar with the Americanized version, where scenes were cut and new footage with American actors were inserted (is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first Godzilla film?)
0.58 	 Now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description, but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie.<br /><br />And although Shusuke Kaneko would later transform Gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s, in the original series, Gamera was not an attractive screen presence.
0.56 	 He just waddles around like a toddler, swaying with each step, and knocks miniature sets over.
0.99 	 As usual, everybody wants to destroy Gamera except for a little kid (Yoshio Uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a 'central' role) who thinks Gamera is a nice turtle.<br /><br />Most movies in the genre that "Gammera the Invincible" is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure.
0.97 	 Even in the company of many other Godzilla-imitators, this Gamera film is not a particularly good entry.
0.96 	 Like Godzilla, Gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters.
0.99 	 But in the case of Gamera, my verdict is just the opposite.
1.0 	 I strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s Gamera trilogy directed by Shusuke Kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested.
1.0 	 The new films are inventive, well-made, exciting, and above all, fun.
0.99 	 "The Second Coming Of Suzanne" is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated, yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep.
0.9 	 Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot.
0.56 	 Yeah...sure.
0.51 	 1/10
0.61 	 I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5.
0.95 	 Now I am older I am interested in show witch are not rated Us.
0.9 	 I have started to watch Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG).
0.99 	 This is a thinking man's silly movie.
0.86 	 So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as advertised.
0.73 	 Each battle was the exact same as the previous.
0.53 	 That will take 6 men from the battalion," and then an actor dies.
0.91 	 The cast of the movie is too big for its own good.
0.86 	 Despite such a long movie, none of the characters were well developed.
0.6 	 They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same.
0.79 	 The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river.
0.68 	 The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town.
0.98 	 It's hard to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place.
0.93 	 The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie).
0.99 	 Neither is it "gripping, taut."
0.86 	 Unfortunately, we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over.
0.95 	 That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer, and "cunning vixen" scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence.<br /><br />I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised.
1.0 	 It would've been an outstanding film.
0.88 	 Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version.
0.99 	 Thats terrible.
1.0 	 it sucks.
0.57 	 ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot but doesn't give time to good ones like Six Degrees.
0.95 	 Everyone's story is now left incomplete, now I'll never know if Steven and Whitney would get together or Carlos and Mae.
0.6 	 I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else.
0.96 	 This is really such a downer.
0.76 	 It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company.
1.0 	 This is probably one of the worst movies ever made.
0.99 	 It's...terrible.
1.0 	 The harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead.
0.59 	 I'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans.
0.65 	 (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
0.76 	 Mark L. Lester is (un)known for his violent (without reason)movies (Commando, The Base).
0.56 	 It's another low-budget unknown B series action movie.
0.93 	 So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other, hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish, what do we get???
0.74 	 It would be better spent reading...<br /><br />...well anything to be honest
1.0 	 Weak scripts at times?
0.6 	 Yep!
0.6 	 Yep!
0.6 	 Yep!
0.6 	 Yep!
1.0 	 I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but found so much of the Dracula/Frankenstein/Mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap.
0.83 	 Mixed in with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak.
0.81 	 Additionally, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his demise, the end of his journalistic career, or jail time.
0.92 	 Lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Lily.
0.98 	 In my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as "The Mummy" because of the success of Brendan Fraser`s film.
0.8 	 I`m sure that you can find better horror movies.
0.85 	 Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made, Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her... Must have been desperate.<br /><br />The bad guys all have bad-guy accents - *bad* bad-guy accents!
0.83 	 (Plummer especially!
0.68 	 Where *did* he learn to do "German"?)
0.98 	 Plummer does bring a certain class to his part, and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick.
0.97 	 The acting, such as it is, is sort of 70's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee's very obviously faked fight scenes, but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film.
1.0 	 I think that, deep down in the darkest, slimiest part of their heart, everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit.
0.85 	 While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid, it also gives us a chance to see that, relatively speaking, most of us have it real good.
1.0 	 Jerry is performing a public service, and we should be grateful.
0.97 	 "Ringmaster" shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show, or so they would like us to think.
0.88 	 The movie follows the pre-requisite Springer story line: Love triangles.
0.96 	 One triangle involves Connie, her daughter Angel, and her husband Rusty.
0.9 	 The other involves Starletta, Vonda, and Demond.
1.0 	 When the two hapless groups meet up in LA, their lives intertwine and collide head-on, all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show.
0.87 	 It also makes me very glad that I don't live in the squalor it's characters do.
0.59 	 It's billed as a comedy, but it just isn't very funny.
0.78 	 Maybe some people watch this and laugh non-stop.
0.76 	 If you think blow jobs and rape are funny, well then I guess you're one of those folks.
0.63 	 And even if there weren't such problems, how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story?
0.84 	 Watching Springer play Springer is sad.
0.88 	 It's like he was going for a 'What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer' vibe, and he failed.
0.66 	 Just the opposite.
0.78 	 Not so surprisingly, no one in this movie went on to greatness.
0.92 	 The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom.
0.7 	 It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts.<br /><br />Here are my Final Thoughts: What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn, who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience.
1.0 	 Somewhere out there, in this crazy, mixed up world, there is a perfect movie for each of us.
1.0 	 Until next time, take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
0.82 	 And don't ever watch "Ringmaster".
0.67 	 show.
0.81 	 I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some "indie"" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it.
0.55 	 Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed.
0.99 	 Within minutes I feel great!!
0.55 	 1.
0.81 	 Take the time.
0.99 	 It really helps.
0.5 	 2.
0.9 	 Closeups are better for Video.
0.58 	 4.
0.69 	 When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before<br /><br />having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking.
0.51 	 5.
0.88 	 Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it.
0.57 	 And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed.
0.99 	 Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they wish!)
1.0 	 starring Melinda/Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr).
0.85 	 She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they're transformed by a newly fallen meteor.
1.0 	 Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications.<br /><br />First off, Clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie.
0.99 	 Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in his film, because she alone keeps you watching.
0.97 	 She proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her Marie.<br /><br />The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture.
0.8 	 They just serve as incidental music for decoration.
0.93 	 It all begins when Michael Keaton, fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since Batman, loses his beautiful author wife, Anna, to a car accident, possibly caused by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she's supposed to be rich.
0.99 	 In his grief, Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby: recording nothing and then watching it.
0.78 	 But she's...DEAD!...Must be ghosts.
0.51 	 Mhmmm.
0.77 	 He gets out of his house just in the nick of time, because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves ("D*mn it!
0.84 	 Am I right guys?
0.93 	 is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons, who in Raiders of the Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him, looking like the cartoons that they are.
0.99 	 The little kid just smiles.
0.79 	 I have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me.
0.99 	 Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window.
0.99 	 This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less).
0.95 	 Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story, he is assumed to be the mole.
0.67 	 No one could have done it better than Matt Damon.
0.92 	 Like Cox, he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision.
0.93 	 I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit, and routinely go to see animated films.
0.75 	 Never happened.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was Gandalf and Magneto).
0.93 	 The problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the ADD-set.
1.0 	 But if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
0.97 	 It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode).
1.0 	 The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride.
0.91 	 I'll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes.
0.93 	 But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance.
1.0 	 The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude.
0.84 	 I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic.
0.99 	 However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.<br /><br />All in all, I don't mind Father of the Pride.
0.91 	 What's not to like about this film?
0.66 	 Everest, there is so much more to it.
0.99 	 The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)<br /><br />It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one.
1.0 	 They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode.
0.9 	 Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business.
0.98 	 Critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.
0.99 	 They shrug and probably never give it another thought.
0.58 	 Some mean-spirited critics (Variety, for example) didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not.
0.88 	 <br /><br />Everybody from ex-Yugoslavia who isn't some extreme Serbian radical will agree with me.
0.77 	 This movie, shows Serbian side, and only Serbian side.
0.78 	 No Serbian crimes were represented.
0.55 	 All ''professionals'' who were interviewed are not professionals at all.
0.66 	 There are thousands of other things, but all of it can be easily checked.
0.91 	 Only few of all accusations are true.
0.96 	 <br /><br />Croatians, Slovenians, Bosnians, and Macedonians never entered Serbian borders.
1.0 	 <br /><br />And Serbian radicals are very, very pleased with this movie (there is about 40% Serbs who vote for radicals).<br /><br />I think everyone understands my points in here.
0.9 	 In this so called documentary is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: Inform yourself before watching this movie.
0.6 	 We are sorry for the situation, but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward) as well.<br /><br />The sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues, and Capano actually had her psychologist killed.
0.95 	 Talk about high concept.
0.66 	 On the plus side this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen-time, his five minute presence seems a tad long.
0.93 	 <br /><br />The re-produced for American audiences version of this, the first film in the "Gamera" series, adds English language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed Japanese fare.
0.79 	 Clearly, the monster is following in the footsteps of "Godzilla".
0.97 	 TV series, musician Wes Farrell's ludicrous theme song heightens the US version's camp appeal.<br /><br />*** Gammera the Invincible (12/15/66) Sandy Howard, Noriaki Yuasa ~ Dick O'Neill, Brian Donlevy, Albert Dekker, John Baragrey
0.81 	 Poor Basil Rathbone, an egotistical composer who's lost his muse.
0.59 	 And then they discover what they've been doing.
1.0 	 Not one of the show's highlights.
1.0 	 I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was great in American Gothic) but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film.
0.99 	 unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby, this is incorrect, although the post-er said he was there they must have a hearing problem!
0.99 	 Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place.
0.91 	 I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada.
0.76 	 I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
0.98 	 I love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say "silent hill" ( which i found to be quite good, but still, was missing something ) and movies that keeps you guessing, this i thought was one of those movies.
0.75 	 At first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down.
0.96 	 I mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of "stolen" themes from that movie in here.. All in all i would say, watch silent hill instead of this one, its better, its more scary, it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better.. And best of all, you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one..
0.93 	 For those looking for a sequel for the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s, this isn't it.
0.97 	 Nor is it a historical drama.
0.51 	 !
0.58 	 A good thriller that works.Delivers both mystery and subterfuge.How reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen.Sentenced to unfair penalties.Even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent, friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie.
0.77 	 How come therefore that it's so packed with McGovernisms.
0.84 	 The majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds.
0.81 	 This is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets.
0.99 	 Numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse.
0.71 	 The only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or forests.<br /><br />But within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot.
0.87 	 Artistically, the film looks right.
0.99 	 Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing.
0.96 	 It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.<br /><br />The acting and direction won't win any Oscars.
0.65 	 For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding.
0.99 	 The music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers.<br /><br />I'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen.
0.87 	 This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD.
0.92 	 And the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.<br /><br />Bottom line -- Is it worth seeing?
0.75 	 If, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a MST3K fan).
0.82 	 The two little child-actors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in Venezia.
0.65 	 People don't seem to be giving Lensman enough credit where its due.
0.52 	 Lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine.
0.54 	 Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka.
0.85 	 Theoretically, anyone could wield the lens.
0.99 	 They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white.
0.64 	 The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60's series where they were battling the Xylons).
1.0 	 Their high-flown lines are rather embarrassing too.
0.71 	 Of course, this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth, hope and possibility being crushed in France, or maybe France itself, despairing, resigned, waiting for death.
0.9 	 Living a rather aimless life, he is profoundly shaken by the lovers' pact, and becomes fatalistic, realising the folly of trying to cheat death.<br /><br />In this way - the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs, and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - Edmond is like a romantic prototype of Melville's clinical killers.
0.83 	 The film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return.
0.76 	 Characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve.
0.86 	 Any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.
1.0 	 The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, i thought her performance was wonderful.
0.52 	 Also, I find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with Gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her.
0.97 	 As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is .
0.62 	 Overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ?
1.0 	 I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies .
0.99 	 Likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( It`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of New York city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable<br /><br />But don`t be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because I consider this to be the best ecological film of the<br /><br />70s .
0.97 	 There is no match.
0.56 	 Except for maybe Melissa in Clarissa Explains it All.
0.99 	 Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth.
1.0 	 Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance).
0.83 	 Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles.
0.8 	 I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for.
0.98 	 Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban.
0.97 	 She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice.
0.96 	 If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
0.99 	 The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people.
1.0 	 Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views.
0.91 	 This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black.
1.0 	 During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles.
0.52 	 Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family.
0.77 	 Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie.
0.77 	 The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.
0.93 	 Unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wife's transformation (the fiends!
0.66 	 ruining it for us).
0.51 	 The beginning part about Alcatraz is a little bit slow, but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where Eddie is on stage.
0.99 	 (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow probably help, huh?)
0.97 	 Fair warning: Eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words in.
0.65 	 Silly, often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his orbit.<br /><br />Am always amazed by Daniels.
0.98 	 He showed such depth and promise in 1983's "Terms of Endearment" as Shirley MacLaine's philandering son-in-law.
0.98 	 As the years have passed, Daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good, meaty role.
0.99 	 At least, the television show brought about a variety of situations.
0.99 	 In the film, we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-Martin.<br /><br />The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film.
0.62 	 On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed.
0.98 	 In the film version, a blond bomb-shell as Brown, tries romantic entanglement.<br /><br />Television star Ray Walston has a small role as a government agent, or is he really that?<br /><br />A very big disappointment for those who enjoyed the television show so much.
0.86 	 Antonioni's movies have aged not well.
0.96 	 <br /><br />I have reviewed yesterday "Zabriskie Point".
1.0 	 In this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of L.A., the publicity advertisements, the deserts,etc., that show the fascination of the author in his American journey, in the same way than Wim Wenders years later.
0.66 	 - The executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation.
0.82 	 - The couple of fat middle-class in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of the nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money.
0.79 	 - Last but not the least, a lot of couples making love in the desert.
0.74 	 And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is then you probably won't like this film.
0.93 	 Special effects are for the birds.
0.99 	 What a gem.
0.99 	 Take it from there as that, alas, is the best part.
0.79 	 I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started back watching it again.
0.75 	 Also there isn't any drugs and violence on it.
0.59 	 Kids should be watching more shows like Full House instead of half the mess on TV now a days.<br /><br />I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth.
0.99 	 Recreation of 1950's (London) Soho and the up-and-coming people.
0.59 	 Give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video.
0.56 	 Besides who are the audience?
1.0 	 Who cares about a book that was well remembered way-back-when.
0.79 	 David Bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight.
0.99 	 The soundtrack album is clay pigeon material.<br /><br />There is one good thing though.
0.87 	 Good recreation of period Soho.
0.9 	 There is really nothing nice I can say about it, besides the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime.
0.65 	 Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker.
0.87 	 Dialogue?
0.75 	 And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate?
0.72 	 The producers must have got something right.
0.76 	 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights.
0.93 	 I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned but man... this is one of the worst dragged out films I have ever seen.
0.81 	 <br /><br />I never, ever, walk out on films, but watching this one at home with family, I walked out.
0.9 	 I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
0.79 	 This reworking of Anthony Shaffer's classic play did not last long in cinemas.
0.52 	 He now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead, played in that version by Laurence Olivier.
1.0 	 (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but lost to Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.)
0.99 	 Looking puffy and washed-out, Caine glides through the part with less depth than he displays as Batman's butler.
0.95 	 What's next -- ALFIE II, or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING?
0.89 	 The late Mr Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must be turning in his grave, wishing he could plan a real murder or two!
0.74 	 It's directed by Martin Kitrosser of Friday the 13th fame.
0.99 	 If you liked the weirdo 4th installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one.
0.9 	 I liked it better than the Matrix!
1.0 	 Enjoy.
0.97 	 It is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale, with the aim of to entertain with bloody, sleazy and humorous context.
0.85 	 The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen, if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi.
1.0 	 Simply: an enjoying and rare gem.
0.54 	 The emotional impact of this movie defies words.
0.89 	 Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically.
0.98 	 OK, I didn't know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido, honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention.
0.74 	 This radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead.
0.9 	 In the town of Willard, a housewife ,Helen, buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill's zombie phobia.
0.98 	 One day Fido's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie.
0.94 	 Timmy "kills" the zombified neighbor.
0.91 	 When a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor, they capture Fido and Timmy.
0.95 	 Helen comes and rescues Timmy and Fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing.
1.0 	 Went to Wal-Mart and found this film on DVD and had no idea whether I made a bad purchase or a good one.
0.72 	 It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end.
0.76 	 Okay, there are a ton of reviews here, what can I possibly add?<br /><br />I will try anyway.
0.96 	 I couldn't disagree more.
0.82 	 <br /><br />During the flashbacks, it's obvious that he isn't all gruff.
0.74 	 If he was totally gone, his partner Marley would never have come for his sake in the first place.
0.56 	 And after all, we are none of us past hoping.
0.81 	 I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say.
1.0 	 And the line that gets me every time, "God forgive me for the time I've wasted."
0.79 	 Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the film.
0.95 	 So much so you can almost smell the sweat.
0.77 	 Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at first a nuisance to her then they become close.
0.52 	 I think you'll like it.
0.8 	 I'm hesitant to call it a Giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are; but many genre entries break the mould, and this would seem to be one of them.
0.75 	 The plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by Julie, his patient who, for some reason, she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her.
0.55 	 We then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people, but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before Julie's arrival...<br /><br />The film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth.
0.81 	 This never really comes off, and I preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point (if any) the film is trying to make.
0.91 	 The film does explain itself at the end; which is lucky as I'm sure I'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then!
0.92 	 Maybe a little dancing would help.
0.69 	 A pretty average scifi film.
0.97 	 Three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed, drugs, ego, and bad attitudes.
0.99 	 Even though these folks were the scum of the earth I still found myself pitying them.
0.81 	 They never really stood much of a chance.
0.61 	 I remember a certain Tuesday, the morning of 18/6/02 to be exact.
0.99 	 In the meantime, the play metamorphoses from a comic play into an indictment against the aloofness of the Israeli society.
0.86 	 With the intention to see a play, that is.<br /><br />This movie, according to Haim Buzaglo himself is the first part of a current agenda trilogy.
0.62 	 I sincerely hope that the other two films will be derived from the experiences like the one I wrote about in the beginning of my review as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent and a plot that is anything but compelling.<br /><br />4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.<br /><br />P.S.
0.56 	 This movie was a landmark in austerity.
0.58 	 but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic.<br /><br />if you check this film out, try to get the letterboxed unrated director's cut for the best viewing option.<br /><br />rating:9
0.89 	 <br /><br />Yes, it is predictable much like The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc etc etc.<br /><br />This show is just good clean television.
0.52 	 Especially with the Coyote!
0.64 	 Perhaps watching again will change that.
0.82 	 Michael Brandon pops up to play a slimy take-no-prisoners type whose comeuppance you can't wait for.
0.99 	 Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men.
0.83 	 Can Superman change the people's ways in time to save the mole men?
0.83 	 Alan Alda plays real-life "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member.
0.98 	 Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble.
0.88 	 Dr. K(David H Hickey)has been trying to master a formula that would end all disease and handicaps, but needs live donors to complete his work.
0.99 	 His doctor brother Richard(Dennis O'Neill)has a son named Eddie(Derek Philips)who is accepted to medical school.
0.79 	 Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah(Lizabeth Cardenas)who is pre-law and plans to attend law school herself the coming fall.
0.97 	 She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah calls things off with her current boyfriend who is also shagging the lady of Walt(Bill Sebastian;Eddie's best friend who recently paid for his cheating girlfriend's boob job).
0.57 	 Eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears on the throes of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard..let him "recuperate" Eddie using his secret, illegal methods.
0.62 	 When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie horrifying results occur.
0.94 	 Eddie's face bulges massive warts while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh.
0.98 	 The gore is limited with a few munching scenes but most of the violence occurs off-camera.
0.72 	 The part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too.
0.97 	 The narration is almost hypnotizing, and from the opening lines, it is impossible to turn away.
0.56 	 Kareena has improved her figure, but is not a good actress anyway.
0.95 	 Akshay is good.
1.0 	 Anil is also good.
0.99 	 May I say the role wasn't good..<br /><br />Great deal of cheapness is filled in.
0.96 	 It has a history of so many good films.
0.99 	 Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text...
0.79 	 Though I still mean it.
0.6 	 And here comes yet another -SHOE!- and I cannot stop here yet.
1.0 	 This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do.
0.54 	 In fact, I'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon."
0.96 	 A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one.
1.0 	 Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent.
0.96 	 In the wake of the hit-man's assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering.
0.83 	 Oberon, who is single and the granddaughter of a judge, pretends that she's the lady in question, Lady Mere, when she's really Leslie Steele.<br /><br />We've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time.
0.71 	 She wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries on, with that hair-do, she's ready to play Snow White.
0.76 	 Davidson at 6200 ft. west of Tahoe, is a prime example, or in the context of the movie, should be.
0.89 	 Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver, suspiciously the same year the Civil War began.
1.0 	 It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name "Mark Twain" and went on to become America's most famous writer.
1.0 	 It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune, and the launching pad of John Mackay, who became the wealthiest man in America, the third wealthiest man in the world.
1.0 	 In the 1860's Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns, the home of the big bonanza, at one time the largest "metropolitan" area west of St. Louis and East of San Francisco.
0.68 	 Flynn is Capt.
0.95 	 Vance Irby, played by Scott.
0.91 	 These two are always getting in each other's way.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.74 	 Irby!
0.94 	 Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named "Julia Hayne", obviously a historical lunge at the town's first lady, Julia Bulette, who in real life a celebrated prostitute.
0.86 	 Go figure.
0.66 	 In "real life" Twain reports that on the last day of the War, the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt.
0.76 	 One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot, like they're fishing, or trying to make the bullets go faster.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 ?
0.85 	 The truth was unreal.
1.0 	 Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust?
0.61 	 It's a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a "city of illusions," where it is said evil seeps out of the ground .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.99 	 Okay, other than that it's a fun movie.
0.97 	 Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying.
0.68 	 No doubt that Prince Philip from "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar-looking.<br /><br />On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) isn't supposed to be likable because she's cold, jealous, bitter and cruel.
0.99 	 However, the stepmother isn't as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters.
0.77 	 The way he walks, sticking up his nose in the air and those arrogant and snobbish facial expressions make him funny.
0.86 	 It is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles, but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision.
0.52 	 I liked this movie because it basically did more with less.
0.99 	 Any more and it would have started to drag.
1.0 	 I understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of the Indians was unacceptable.
0.82 	 But this moving isn't about politics.
0.98 	 It follows that tried and true European formula that they love to subsidize, that is never seen, but that the critics think makes an "important point".<br /><br />The movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between Americans and Europeans regarding employment.
0.81 	 In this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it's the government's duty to provide them with work.
0.98 	 I, like many die-hard Trekkers (or Trekkies, i don't care!)
0.65 	 (I was shocked!)
0.99 	 I can't think of anything I didn't like.
0.97 	 'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives.
1.0 	 It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince.
1.0 	 to those saying this movie stinks.
0.93 	 The only flaw in this movie is, I don't think there was enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles.
0.87 	 They should have dwelled more on that.
0.76 	 Selma Blair needs to eat something.
0.68 	 She's worrying me.
0.81 	 Go see.<br /><br />RATING: **1/2 out of ****
0.94 	 The colors, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies, and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon.
0.96 	 For me, this movie fit like a glove.
0.9 	 This movie is not for everyone.
0.96 	 You're either bright enough to get "it" or you're not.
0.93 	 It was difficult to read the ?subtitles (what do you call that in silent films?)
0.75 	 I can't believe this is on this website as a comedy!
0.61 	 He is the right age rather than being played by someone who is almost a teenager as in the other films.
0.73 	 That's right, you heard me.
1.0 	 <br /><br />I can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice.
0.68 	 To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: don't quit your day job.
0.98 	 I am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) in the right colour (white) and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigades.
0.62 	 I couldn't fault any of this from my memories, and the sandbagged Anderson shelter and the WVS canteens brought it all back.
0.52 	 Amateur, no budget films can be surprisingly good ... this however is not one of them.<br /><br />Ah, another Brad Sykes atrocity.
0.6 	 Normally, a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not this guy.
0.77 	 It's a good movie, but after you've seen it once, you might want to see it again.
1.0 	 Actually I probably found it more entertaining than 'Ghoulies', but I preferred thst one's darker tone.
1.0 	 That's where the fun occurs.
0.83 	 It's silly, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing.
0.99 	 Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak... and with attitude.<br /><br />Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') were fair leads.
0.65 	 Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles.
0.95 	 And we get titty shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree to boot.<br /><br />A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert.
0.89 	 According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were leftover sets from the Klaus Kinski film, ANDROID which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks.<br /><br />Inside the container is a midget alien (played by Ray's son) who starts clawing people to death.
0.98 	 It's fun to watch, I'll grant ya that.
1.0 	 As said before, the visual effects are stunning.
1.0 	 They're breathtaking.
0.75 	 I personally use Blender and graphics like that are not easy AT ALL.
0.65 	 The conflict seems to be between man and nature here.
0.6 	 Here, there's a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature.
0.68 	 As the movie progresses, it's clear that a conflict exists between man and nature.
0.5 	 Proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian looking after a lost child to being a "sick man".
0.8 	 He betrays us.
0.98 	 It's not a story about someone, through struggle, emerging stronger.
0.85 	 It's depressing and has not point because there's no great truth about the human soul or about the world brought to light like a great drama does.
0.83 	 However, the graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than mere eye candy.
0.95 	 ...but the graphics are good.
0.77 	 And of course as every Disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys that one.
0.96 	 The only character that has not been disgraced in this film is Tink.
0.64 	 The only star is for her.<br /><br />The story itself then?
1.0 	 Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece of- There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one.
0.8 	 )<br /><br />Ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal.
0.93 	 Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions.
0.97 	 Jordan took a month to train, and they cast her as a person who makes the Olympic team.
0.96 	 I remember this film, exhibit in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for the time of a week.
0.98 	 Although it could seems incredible, and I can't offer any explanation for it, this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to... movies of art and big quality (that, is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, BuÃ±uel, and...
0.85 	 Very indicative.
0.71 	 It seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm.
0.94 	 I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film.
0.65 	 "Summer Of Sam" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz.
1.0 	 It's a gritty, earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of '77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city.<br /><br />The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood, and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat.
0.99 	 Lee then belabors their high energy, chaotic lives, which are filled with anger, lust, and general turmoil.
0.94 	 Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace, that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good.
0.99 	 (There has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye; Mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio).<br /><br />And no flat butt to boot, which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres'.
0.99 	 Mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded German-Guy Victim No.
0.98 	 2, but from all I could see from her bikini shots, she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it.<br /><br />Mandy's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'Mommy's Girl', with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones.
0.96 	 Her bisexual nature (allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with German Guy No.
0.55 	 But this would enable her to reconcile her Bo Derek face with her Vida Guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too Nordic, and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by Michelle Johnson of the 1980's whose early fame in Blame it on Rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground.<br /><br />Vambo Drule.
0.97 	 The man refuses and he's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand.
0.6 	 It seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in "Manchurian Candidate."
0.59 	 Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers?
0.57 	 <br /><br />No, I momentarily paused on Cheap Seats while channel surfing, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I blacked out.<br /><br />It's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad.
0.97 	 The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters.
0.99 	 making the environment more darker.
0.79 	 This is 2006!
0.86 	 Most of the horror scenes we're taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies.
0.98 	 How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, its now coming from the window next door?
1.0 	 If you want a good horror movie, go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website.
1.0 	 My rating: 8/10.<br /><br />Misc notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was (predictably) poorly dubbed, and lacked full cast & crew credits.
0.8 	 I can't believe currently this movie is rated a 6.9.
0.91 	 This is because i've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not as well of thinking their below their standards which i feel is very shallow.
0.83 	 Why cancelated?
0.96 	 We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones.
0.9 	 Prior to seeing Show People, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only.
0.99 	 I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls.
0.96 	 This is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy, and I must say that no matter how much of the period-specific references you actually get (I didn't, apparently), you will not be bored by this movie.
0.99 	 Its a german movie, which is unfortunately a bad precondition, cause we rareley produce more than moderate movies ;).
0.78 	 Especially Gigi, the main actor.
0.55 	 You live every second, every feeling he does.
0.85 	 Well, you just dont believe him the role.
0.99 	 Many people will probably hate this movie, say its boring.
0.75 	 Not much tension?
1.0 	 - yes, but an outrageous movie.
0.53 	 9 out of 10.
0.99 	 The movie tells the tale of Dolemite, a bad ass pimpin' hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife.
0.57 	 <br /><br />2.
0.77 	 WWE Crusierweight championship: Jamie Noble w/ Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really didn't care about either wrestler and didn't get interested until Kidman did a shooting star press.
1.0 	 In fact it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, no one even cared or knew (you can tell by the lack of camera's flashing).
0.62 	 <br /><br />3.
0.72 	 Although it started off kinda slow (which it always is with big show) Booker T was impressive and did a sick move on the announcers table.
1.0 	 WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match.
1.0 	 This ended up being a mediocre match at best but was still OK for PPV.
0.95 	 No one could predict who would come out of this one.
0.69 	 If your going to buy this DVD i would buy it strictly for this match.
0.78 	 (ending?
0.91 	 Remember the shot from "the Natural", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from??
0.78 	 Such over-acting in the cabin.
0.88 	 If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation.
0.95 	 Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now.
1.0 	 Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.
0.94 	 MY EYES!
0.87 	 IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY MAKE ME UNSEE THIS MOVIE!
0.78 	 what drugs are you people on!
0.99 	 when i thought to watch this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family we thought "oh hey, this may be funny!
0.97 	 Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon.
1.0 	 Distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together DVDs of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the well-designed DVD cover.
0.69 	 The first segment, "Blood Reunion", pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing ... a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on, only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men, and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret.
0.93 	 It tells the story of a lesbian couple, one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power.
0.83 	 This short movie shows that Lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project, but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie.<br /><br />And finally we have "Manbeast", in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas.
0.82 	 After all, would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself?
1.0 	 I love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one.
0.97 	 Never mind the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the pacing is deadly.
0.99 	 The best thing about the Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who isn't seen nearly enough.
0.99 	 He had the most dramatic potential.
0.98 	 I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful.
0.58 	 I remember how hard it was when John was shot.
0.97 	 This movie was a great disappointment for me.
0.99 	 The voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned.
0.63 	 It just did not do the comic justice at all!
0.51 	 !
0.81 	 Her body language.
0.94 	 And the rest of the cast were pretty damned good, too!
0.66 	 What /IS/ this world coming to, anyway?
0.6 	 So, when crazed Lara moves into Patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers, I didn't even blink.
0.85 	 Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers!!
1.0 	 The horror!<br /><br />But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic.
1.0 	 You need to watch it once, just for the great laughs you'll have.
0.87 	 You'll understand later.
0.67 	 I had watched several days film shooting of this movie that summer,the end result was just two scenes in the movie.
0.88 	 Bring the wagon,stop the wagon etc .
0.99 	 So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed.
0.77 	 The local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real.
0.96 	 (yes Doris, animals were hurt during filming) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining?
0.82 	 You like complex narrations?
0.51 	 Ho-hum.
0.86 	 'OffOn' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information.
0.96 	 I had a thought Â and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation Â that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense.
0.57 	 The traditional sort.
0.91 	 One to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives.<br /><br />Of course, it happened many years before she was born, but you wouldn't guess from the way she tells it.
0.57 	 Warning stories.
0.81 	 Stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland, its rugged mountains shrouded in mists.
0.82 	 He burns with frustration.
0.84 	 Where does fiction end?
0.83 	 Can the truth be told?
1.0 	 Like Angus, I got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories.
0.95 	 Forget the box-office pastiche of Braveheart and its like.
1.0 	 Most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many home video versions of it over the years.
0.57 	 It is also letterboxed.<br /><br />Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet only to find out that he's contracted a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair.
0.88 	 Ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as Daninsky battles a she-wolf!
0.89 	 The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia.
0.91 	 In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ("This is the history of a failure" he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal) to concentrate fully on Che's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia.
0.98 	 The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle.
0.93 	 Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent, Aguirre, the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas.
0.55 	 He seems more concerned with keeping Che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders.
1.0 	 One would think he was steeped in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style.
0.99 	 We're cashing in on GREMLINS' success here!"
0.85 	 and a cardboard cut-out of Clint Eastwood telling us... what about his western movies exactly?
0.72 	 And if you manage to crack a smile while watching it, you'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film's finished.<br /><br />Good Badness?
0.58 	 They should pay YOU to watch it not you pay them.
0.98 	 One awful day, Preston was riding his bicycle; It was the same day that the villain of the story,Quigley, was trying to scape from the Police and accidentally ran the car over Preston's bike.
0.98 	 The problem was: It was a blank check!
0.7 	 Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check: 1 million dollars!
0.97 	 No such luck.
0.96 	 Not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend Ruth, to feel sorry for him Al in fact is the one who feels sorry for himself more then anyone else in the movie.
1.0 	 Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her.
0.94 	 He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one, she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business.
0.65 	 At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely.
0.75 	 The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too.
0.77 	 So this made for TV film scores only a 7.6 on this site?
0.89 	 We all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later on that evening.
0.9 	 But hey, this is George C. Scott.
0.71 	 I hope that the director will make another one
0.53 	 Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel.
0.93 	 I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child.
0.99 	 Maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help.
1.0 	 She has to do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father.
0.51 	 But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.<br /><br />Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh?
0.58 	 I'd give it minus 10 if possible...unbelievable.
0.99 	 I searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything.
0.72 	 I cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties.
0.98 	 and shot in Vancouver with the 'mountains' of the low country of South Carolina visible in the background.
1.0 	 They should have been beautiful.
1.0 	 No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department.
0.98 	 i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame.
0.5 	 but frankly i like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now.
1.0 	 Valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's distaste for war.
0.61 	 I dont know about you, but I've always felt drawn to 'ART' cinema.
0.94 	 The first 'art' film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover", which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive.
1.0 	 The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque...this is what 'art cinema' was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose.
1.0 	 Life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and art expressed shows it for what it is.
0.83 	 There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film, unlike what the previews have suggested.
0.99 	 The main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son, brought together after the mothers' death.
1.0 	 In the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable, you can feel his pain.
0.99 	 The acting for the most part if fine,...especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer(though poor Mandy should put her clothes back on) What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch.
0.93 	 Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who didn't play the sympathy card, and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child.
0.52 	 The media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece.
0.99 	 They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn, not sit there and look blank.
0.87 	 Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be too detached, and no one wants to see that.
0.92 	 Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media.
1.0 	 They'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public.
0.72 	 Let's start this review out on a positive note -- I am very glad they didn't decide to wimp out with Tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring.
0.74 	 We don't actually know if Tony will live or die.
0.79 	 He's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none.
0.92 	 This episode seemed to move very slow, and the coma induced dream Tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed Asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely, flat-out weird.
0.78 	 I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, which AJ most likely won't have the balls to pull off.
0.86 	 This was a necessary episode for the series, even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion.
0.96 	 The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.
1.0 	 As you can tell, this wasn't a memorable night.
0.98 	 Close second has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist.
0.57 	 Also, although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to (i.e.
0.95 	 After it finally totally brainwashed me into submission, I found the songs to be irresistible, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy...
1.0 	 I was thinking that it was going to be amazing, because the soundtrack is so cute.
0.97 	 Unfortunately most of the songs that I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw.
0.93 	 Doesn't she realize that that piece was his immortality?
0.92 	 When will you learn?
0.88 	 In fact I don't know why in the world did I decide to watch it.
0.63 	 Anyway, I just did... And what a surprise.
0.99 	 He's last work deals with the midlife crisis, the disappointing, and the seeking for a second chance after you've ruined it all.
0.86 	 ** HERE BE SPOILERS **<br /><br />The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol.
0.64 	 The soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before.
0.83 	 However the government is downsizing, the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his own safety.
0.54 	 He activates and controls the UniSols and start to run mayhem.
0.95 	 The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme).
0.98 	 Choreographed fighting.
0.93 	 Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight.
0.99 	 Unfortunately for this movie, it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible.
0.99 	 Normally you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants.
0.76 	 Then the fights just become a tool to stretch time.
1.0 	 You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes.
1.0 	 "Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games, a series of adventure games about the roguish writer/paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight.
0.88 	 Gabriel and his companion, Grace, have been asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called "night visitors."
0.85 	 When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel pursues the night visitors to Rennes le ChÃ¢teau, where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires.
0.94 	 Although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game, their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot.<br /><br />A large part of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight installments was in the relationships which Gabriel formed with the villains.
1.0 	 The ally leaves hints about the mystery of Rennes le ChÃ¢teau in broad daylight and expects Grace (and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group) to find them.
0.53 	 The only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory.<br /><br />The game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the Holy Grail.
0.94 	 I didn't mind all the walking.
0.86 	 People really did walk places back then.
0.64 	 It's about time.
1.0 	 He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it.
0.99 	 The "story" comes off as more of an afterthought.
1.0 	 I think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie.
1.0 	 Had the romance been ditched, the story might have been a little too weak.
0.73 	 I thought Mel Harris was pretty good; her short skirts, i think, added some sex appeal... but this Rob Stewart guy probably could have been better cast, maybe with a more well known TV movie actor.
0.54 	 This was just a tv-movie, though, so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture and some of that Ummmph came from the scenery.
1.0 	 Overall, twasn't really a bad movie.
0.71 	 (and the only that i know of.)
1.0 	 I hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made-for-tv movie, giving it a grade of C-
0.98 	 All the patrons are motionless, like mannequins.
0.55 	 Not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer through some cheap spin-off story hosted by an evil Dr. Mario.
0.51 	 2/10
0.96 	 a truly original vampyre story.
0.97 	 they are pure evil to.
0.99 	 <br /><br />the film is not perfect.
0.52 	 the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though.
0.98 	 the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people.
0.8 	 i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances.
0.66 	 Oh please!
0.98 	 Haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much I missed her.
0.61 	 The abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists.
0.75 	 The young boyfriend was a hottie.
0.95 	 Can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this?
0.64 	 And McQueen's salary was 3K?
0.67 	 Thumbs down.
0.99 	 Anyone who loved the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film.
0.98 	 All the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady, and given "three" in return.
0.97 	 The second is All in Good Time.
0.73 	 He actually looks kind of other-worldly, like an alien family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while dad was out taking a ... attending to nature's call, Spot got loose and they just didn't have time to hunt him down.
0.73 	 That, or he's the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster.
0.99 	 The trees and vistas say Canada to me, and it's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber-coldness one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China.
0.99 	 The Yeti apparently can leap about like Spiderman...or Super Mario...remember?
0.69 	 Jump higher!
0.62 	 Or maybe it wants to mate, but that thought is BANISHED!
0.51 	 REBANISHED!
0.69 	 <br /><br />And it's superhuman.
0.92 	 And he's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur.
0.51 	 FABulous Dahlink!
0.85 	 He's fastidiously superhu-...super-Yeti.<br /><br />All in all?
0.99 	 This was a lot of fun to watch, has some great kills and a few honest plot elements.
0.62 	 <br /><br />It rates a 6.0/10 on the M4TV Scale.<br /><br />It rates a 4.4/10 on the Movie Scale from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
0.94 	 The only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors.<br /><br />Released in 1993, "Darkness" garnered something of a cult following upon release.
0.55 	 The whole show is basically about to go with the flow.
0.65 	 I watch it almost every day.
0.7 	 I rate it 10/10.
1.0 	 Natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline, and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster.
0.82 	 Instead, he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways, so much in fact, that you may in fact believe there is this Cube were people try to escape, or in the case of NOTHING, a large empty expanse where there is... nothing!
0.67 	 The advert had me hooked instantly.
0.66 	 It seemed so simple!
0.69 	 Take two characters who no one likes, and send them to a world where there is nothing.
0.98 	 Natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist.
0.94 	 In fact, the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film.
0.99 	 There's nothing there, but also 'something' there.<br /><br />It might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading.
0.84 	 I was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so.
0.91 	 Therefore upon watching the film, i laughed every now and again, whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused.<br /><br />If i may take a minute to give the film some praise, where the film excels on is the concept.
1.0 	 Where each wall, north, earth, south, west, up and down is just a white plane, a perception of depth becomes faulty.
1.0 	 The film is relatively short, but even so, after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull, and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot.
0.98 	 We can also argue that the acting is once again, questionable.
0.99 	 These two characters are in a sense, unlikeable, therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters.
0.97 	 Do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film.
0.99 	 Just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street.
0.55 	 Of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling.<br /><br />For me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film.
0.52 	 I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom.
0.55 	 My wife has double the attention span that I do.
0.97 	 Never blossomed.
0.96 	 It started fairly strong with a promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes to Spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll.
0.62 	 We FF'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space.
0.63 	 Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried.
0.96 	 It's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy.
0.93 	 I'm shocked it scores so high.
0.99 	 It's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either DVD or VHS.
0.99 	 However, while i am normally a fan of Clea DuVall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie.
0.81 	 Bang, bang, bang.
0.9 	 All in long shot.<br /><br />If you're enthralled by stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal.<br /><br />Oh, it's as exciting as it is mindless.
0.98 	 Pretty Boy Floyd meets his demise dramatically.
0.74 	 Plenty of shoot outs with Tommy guns and pistols.
0.94 	 Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, partly, I would guess, because of his name.
0.83 	 Melvin PURVIS?
0.95 	 That is, kill 'em all and let God sort them out.<br /><br />You'll just love it.
0.99 	 I was dead wrong.
0.95 	 Dumbland is something I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch.
0.93 	 There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces.
0.84 	 The dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror--and bad things naturally occur as a result.<br /><br />If this film had been made just a decade later, I am sure I wouldn't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film.
1.0 	 After all, the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is, at times, a bit stilted.
0.95 	 No a good reason to take this journey.
0.93 	 Pitt and Lewis are great actors; magnificent Michelle Forbes but a weak David Duchovny performance...
0.89 	 I think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs!
0.9 	 Do you know when you look at your collection of old, videotaped movies, and realize that there are some that you've only seen once or twice, and you can't remember if they're worth the time it takes to see them?
0.79 	 The Alibi is/was one of those films; I found it, not long ago, and decided I might as well give it a chance.
0.97 	 The film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress me(through film): court scenes.
0.88 	 Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it.
0.51 	 3/10
1.0 	 There's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke.
0.57 	 So, I just went along for the ride.
0.89 	 Miss Belmont was totally different to what I had imagined her to be!
0.62 	 Then, about 1 1/2 years later, there came part two.
0.62 	 Then, about 1/2 a year later, part 3 came out.
0.99 	 !<br /><br />Viewing the current state of affairs in India where The wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the Directors ..also can be called Uncle Scars (refer movie The Lion King) came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves ...including the spermikins !
0.56 	 !<br /><br />Story line : Married couple - very happy - but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage - lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother !<br /><br />Now in in India, the in- laws usually drive away the daughter- in- law if she fails to give them an heir !
0.94 	 !<br /><br />Neighbours !
0.87 	 society !!
0.81 	 gosh the same ones who watch Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 ...al in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making !
0.86 	 In the mean time - no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat !
0.51 	 !
0.99 	 Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you're not in the mood for that.
0.79 	 I watch a lot of films, good, bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon, even if it is only set design, or the reliable labor of a good character actor, or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever.<br /><br />However, I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film, one I had never seen before.
1.0 	 "Confidential Agent" is one of those lesser vehicles, yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway, despite lackluster direction, the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer's depictions as (respectively) British and Spanish, and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads.
1.0 	 I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull, and I can understand that.
0.92 	 Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world.
0.58 	 What is a thief?
0.96 	 Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin?
0.99 	 Bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of Shakespeare.
0.91 	 A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The little acting there is comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm.
0.9 	 Le Besco apart, there is little to recommend this film.
0.99 	 'Metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college.
0.83 	 The acting, while not stellar, is mostly competent.
0.7 	 You can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality.
0.92 	 Special effects aren't stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.<br /><br />The lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'.
0.63 	 Nothing that is going to bring you back, and nothing to buy on its own.
0.92 	 I was looking forward to seeing a good movie.
1.0 	 Thank you Christian Slater for putting some humor into it.
0.99 	 OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with.
0.93 	 Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list.
0.88 	 I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one.
0.99 	 As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best.
0.84 	 This mini series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as was `Queen', tried to use similar formulas, that is, constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years.
1.0 	 Whereas in `Queen' the result was masterful, here in Mama Flora the inspiration was lacking.
1.0 	 Only recommendable for those who have an appetite for these lengthy tales of generations growing up.
0.81 	 I actually paid to see this movie in the theater.<br /><br />It would get a 1-rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are okay, and there's a surprise.<br /><br />I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others.
0.93 	 But pay attention to the guy who's closest to a butler.
0.55 	 There ya go.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0.92 	 It's almost like you're watching a newsreel.
0.75 	 I then had a crush on Mary Moronov.
0.76 	 9 out of 10.<br /><br />This's the only movie I own on original tape.
0.97 	 The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels.
1.0 	 There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.<br /><br />I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page.
0.95 	 hanging on the right from the chalk ledge.
0.94 	 In the next camera shot, there only 2.
0.99 	 It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for.
1.0 	 Comes this heartwarming tale of hope.
0.92 	 The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police.
1.0 	 Underneath this clever outline however, lies a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits.
0.58 	 Or not.<br /><br />Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people getting hit by pans?
0.68 	 Save your money for something funny.<br /><br />Respect
0.95 	 Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently.
0.58 	 The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene's.
0.71 	 I think that is better too.
0.72 	 Are they related in any way?
0.7 	 The screenplay, though, sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird, surrealistic way.
1.0 	 The entire team must have forgotten to read it through, maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was.
0.64 	 But that's about it.
0.63 	 The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect.
0.66 	 I watched it because it aired on cable.
0.74 	 <br /><br />The creature is the cheesiest you can get!
0.78 	 Please, you need to be very generous not to get angered by the CHEAP Halloween costume.
0.98 	 "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like "Halloween".
0.98 	 This TV-made thriller is all talk, little action.
0.59 	 It has a quasi-"Ten Little Indians" scenario, but ditches it mid-way through in favor of spotlighting Sally Field and her uncovering of a killer.
0.81 	 The early introductions are good, but the writing quickly strays off-course and eventually goes over the top.
0.96 	 I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly.
0.92 	 I generally agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film.
1.0 	 the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening.
0.65 	 Not even close to Greenaway's better work.
0.98 	 "I can't explain.
0.57 	 Just see it."
0.99 	 We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo wasn't on (it's not like the writers/producers could do anything about that).
0.5 	 2.
0.98 	 Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him?
0.86 	 Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.
0.88 	 King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors.
0.99 	 Not that anyone in this movie was that great.
0.55 	 I've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better.
0.7 	 The stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp Hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell, sell.
0.52 	 One man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt.
0.83 	 It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was that pat.
1.0 	 Not a bad picture, but just same ol', same ol'.
0.86 	 Mitch wants nothing to do with her.
0.74 	 The director had a gift for this type of movie, and though he had many imitators, he never had an equal.
0.94 	 It relies on the typical American thriller plot - "who is going to outsmart everyone".
0.94 	 Acting is below average, but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises.
0.5 	 For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point.
0.62 	 Almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical Lynch film.
0.73 	 "Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isn't his own."
1.0 	 He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse.
0.78 	 Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film.
1.0 	 I know some people think the movie is boring but I disagree.
1.0 	 And he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau.
0.52 	 The films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred, and the bureau's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950's.
0.98 	 One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted, "Yes!"
0.68 	 In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check.
0.79 	 Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters.
0.99 	 A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves.
0.71 	 Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates.
0.74 	 Definitely one of funny man Eddie Murphy's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and a "Chosen One".<br /><br />Murphy is the "Chosen One" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world".
0.93 	 A finder of lost and missing children, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him he is "The Chosen One", and that it is his destiny to find and rescue "The Golden Child".
0.68 	 Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa can't do much for proceedings.
0.99 	 But as he hasn't, I'll have to give it a go myself.<br /><br />The only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent.
0.9 	 I stress the word "little" since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.<br /><br />The story takes place in the future.
1.0 	 A world in which the great superpowers (that according to this movie are the United States and Russia) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots.
0.95 	 Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander.
0.55 	 Lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.<br /><br />Well, the idea is awesome I guess.
0.98 	 The great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots?
0.99 	 And I'm like well this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon?"
1.0 	 I could go through it, cause I loved this film as a kid, and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it.
0.72 	 But unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!
0.9 	 )the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them.
0.95 	 Heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.<br /><br />OK granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other.
0.97 	 There are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go "thats why I liked thid movie!"
0.96 	 You know, giant robots duking it out?
0.76 	 Hello?
0.99 	 After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn't a good mix.<br /><br />So for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like I do) well Id suggest you steer clear away from this one.
0.86 	 Gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just didn't do it for me.
0.99 	 The murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles, which surely they were.
0.93 	 The director has misled the audience into believing the Brian Jonestown Massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98.
1.0 	 But he's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with her role as Desdemona.<br /><br />Unfortunately Shelley Winters as a poor waitress who a depressed Colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor Desdemona in the play.
0.74 	 Besides recognising some of the locations, I found myself not in the least bit surprised.
0.98 	 This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level, so my brother and I watched it.
0.74 	 Boy gets crush on girl--correction, his *dream*-girl (apparently there is a difference; and I'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl--he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away.
0.89 	 Unless you're interested in seeing Chad Lowe's early days, before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the HIV-positive gay guy on the series "Life Goes On", or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably got to stare at Dennis Franz's buttocks).
0.76 	 I'm surprised I watched it all.
0.97 	 Can *You* Take the Challenge?
0.94 	 I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it.<br /><br />If you like constant killing and greed, then watch the movie.
0.98 	 You just want the dark side to get every one of them.<br /><br />Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars.
0.98 	 Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the "mysterious" Orient.
0.84 	 Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as "The Darkling".
0.97 	 <br /><br />During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil.
0.9 	 Basically, lets do a kind of Legally Blond film, but do it in New York.
0.84 	 Physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 (especially in public) hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends/ relatives.
0.63 	 I just watched it last night, but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because I read the book first.
0.97 	 The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the film.
0.96 	 If you plan to watch "Of Human Bondage," don't read the book beforehand.
0.99 	 I do not make this claim lightly.
1.0 	 Now I had the best intentions when watching this one.
1.0 	 I like some of Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard otherwise from other people.
0.95 	 <br /><br />In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard.
0.63 	 The people who did perform well, were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie.
0.53 	 I'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once.
0.63 	 <br /><br />Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and "somewhat" funny, and you don't care about everything I mentioned above, you might like it.
0.89 	 I saw this back in '94 when it was finally released.
0.68 	 One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating.
0.77 	 I had to see this show,and that is what I really did.
1.0 	 It has since spawned 7 sequels, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween when they do those 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' lists it's always on there.
0.94 	 I could go on and on, but the big question here is: How does the film hold up today?
0.55 	 Good performances from the then mostly unknown cast.
0.99 	 The pace is slow, but steady and never drags.
0.97 	 Unlike most other slasher films, this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count.<br /><br />Cons: Probably not nearly as scary now as it was then.
0.95 	 Many of the goofs really stand out.
0.95 	 And just because it's been remade for a new generation doesn't mean it'll be forgotten.
0.57 	 No way, no how.<br /><br />My rating: 5/5
0.72 	 In their lab(a run down warehouse in L.A.), they create a T-Rex.
0.98 	 She is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio.
0.8 	 After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not meant to be ironic.
0.83 	 So, the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil.
0.61 	 Sounds like a typical story.
0.66 	 Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it.
1.0 	 Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ("The highway belongs to me...ME!
0.69 	 check it out.
0.61 	 This had all the makings of a very good film -- good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet) and lots of stock footage (if the Air Force had film of jets firing rockets, it was used).
0.9 	 For instance, both the Soviets and the US fire anti-ballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy.
0.97 	 Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin.
0.86 	 Parker's character cries and boo-hoos at Loggia's sacrifice like she was at a screen test.
0.95 	 Loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman.
0.97 	 After the missile's info is sent to DC, the Pentagon brings in a group of scientists.
0.85 	 A general (Larry Kerr) announces that the missile will hit New York City in 63 minutes.
0.74 	 Civil Defense people leave work and go to their stations.
0.89 	 Eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids (and we get to see the whitest New York City I've ever seen, though watching 50's sci-fi films made it seems like this was the standard).
0.89 	 He slowly produces a caseload of plutonium, loads it in a jeep and takes it from DC to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile.
0.94 	 Loggia is still driving to the base (4 more miles to go).
0.97 	 Five seconds later, the blast dissipates and all is clear.
0.88 	 As far as I know, it hasn't been re-issued on any medium and for good reason.
0.55 	 I don't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice, but there's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists, military men and businessmen into deep shelters, saying they're too valuable to lose.
0.95 	 Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano.
0.99 	 Then we go to "Present Day Budapest".
0.78 	 OK, was the opener in the past or the future?
0.77 	 Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he's had in related fields, and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him.
0.76 	 Aha!
0.95 	 So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects?
0.98 	 He must have been one of the top guys, he's friends with the c e o of the Chemical company, for God sakes.
0.97 	 Then there's the substance itself: Technically a poison, but it mutates in immune 'carriers', so we can have whatever we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life.
0.94 	 How convenient.
0.73 	 The copyright at the end indicates 1983.
0.82 	 And though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film, I will say that watching a film obviously made in the Aquarian Age (including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons) but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling.
0.98 	 Extremely unsettling.<br /><br />My main objection here is HOW DARE THE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE.
0.66 	 HOW DARE THEY.<br /><br />Seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies I've seen her in - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill her off.<br /><br />I would like to put the film industry on notice.
0.98 	 The soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on The Equalizer.
0.51 	 It's really bad.<br /><br />Also, they made Pamela Franklin squash her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the viewer) such as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
0.98 	 I say that we have a right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice.
0.71 	 Who's with me?
0.72 	 In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape.
0.75 	 He breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector Javert.
0.94 	 Some worth mentioning would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme.
1.0 	 Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche, and Enjolras.
0.99 	 The only character with the same name is Javert.
0.99 	 A portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the Kelippoth of the Sitra Achra by a man whose daughter, Summer, gets kidnapped by something, taken into it.
0.99 	 Summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters.
0.94 	 Anyway, three wannabee witches, who went to high school together, Renea, the most enthusiastic, serious practitioner in the dark arts, and her lesbian cohorts, Jasmine and Marlene(..it's more or less a passing fad with them, though..) join up with buddies, Jason and Ricky, on a trip in the wilderness where Summer vanished from her home ten years ago.
0.72 	 Opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book, a demon is set free, as is Summer, now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world.<br /><br />Low budget contains a loopy, but ambitious story, restraining it into a confined setting.
0.92 	 As can be the case in these movies, the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as Summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass, while befriending Jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time.
0.6 	 The action is shot mostly in the dark, making any violence hard to decipher.
0.97 	 Brigitte Kingsley(and the rest of the female cast for that matter), is some mighty nice eye candy, dressed scantily clad as a female Conan, a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie.
1.0 	 Landy Cannon is likable as unlikely hero, Jason, a lovestruck, naive young man whose ex-fiancÃ©, Jasmine(Vanessa James)is now bi-sexual and in love with Marlene(..Jasmine's cruelty is in toying with Jason's feelings by hiding her affair with Marlene from his knowledge), while Ricky and Renea attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can rekindle a dead flame that gone out, never to ignite again.
0.72 	 The lesbian antics of Jasmine and Marlene(Haley Shannon) is mostly tame, their love making, once alone in the woods up against a tree, is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night.
0.93 	 The movie aims to please and is marketed to the boys(and girls who love hot women).
0.94 	 I think, though, for the most part, the humor falls a bit flat.
0.84 	 I don't remember a movie where I have cared less about where the characters have come from, what happens to them or where they are going.
1.0 	 This is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness .
1.0 	 After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries.
0.99 	 These shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the Skater seem almost ominous.
0.73 	 Thumbs upish, I say.
1.0 	 The rudimentary premise of "What's the matter with Helen?"
0.76 	 In the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director Curtis Harrington ("Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?")
0.98 	 The script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced.
0.99 	 There's never a dull moment in "What's the matter with Helen", although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot.
0.99 	 Your submission must be your own original work.
0.99 	 Your comments will normally be posted on the site within 2-3 business days.
0.99 	 Your submission must be your own original work.
0.99 	 Your comments will normally be posted on the site within 2-3 business days.
0.6 	 He upsets the locals, getting convincingly beaten in one scene, and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood.
0.98 	 I would endulge in true art movies, like 'Clerks', 'Something about Mary', 'El Mariachi', or 'La Taqueria'.
0.97 	 And of course Sly Stallone's even less talented brother well..... =\<br /><br />Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of Claremont, Ont.
0.91 	 (about 20 miles N.east of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings.
0.68 	 I think the Drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was torn down.
0.67 	 It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better.
0.84 	 Look- I've seen LOTS and I do mean LOTS of these types of films.
0.66 	 It's pretty simple.
0.97 	 I mean, Jesus.. Oh, but the crawling-on-her-back-demon thingee was pretty neat...
0.69 	 But to me, it doesn't really compare to movies like Toy story and stuff.
0.94 	 But the film didn't feel quite as...
0.91 	 I shouldn't have reviewed this film, but I am.
1.0 	 There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you.
0.99 	 And it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals.
0.92 	 Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support.
0.88 	 And he may have been right, it lacks a basic credibility: 70s Edinburgh wasn't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath.
0.78 	 Psychologically, this will have people of all persuasions (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) scratching their heads but reaching for the popcorn all the same.
0.94 	 And I thought The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage.
1.0 	 The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor, and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations.
0.93 	 There were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the English word?)
0.84 	 Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh.
0.55 	 Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene.
0.96 	 The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared...
0.88 	 This splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed Tarzan series put out by MGM.
0.93 	 The group claim to want to hunt animals, and Tarzan agrees for Jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point, the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds.
0.6 	 Tarzan is shot, left for dead; and the group force Jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous "elephant's graveyard".
0.99 	 But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions.
0.74 	 "CASOMAI" was the last movie I've seen before getting married, just last year.
0.86 	 <br /><br />It was also the first movie I've searched for, after I was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest.<br /><br />Sometimes, reality is not that apart from fiction.
0.66 	 It wasn't quite as good as I was led to believe.
1.0 	 Whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology.
1.0 	 I couldn't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is a poor man's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry.
0.85 	 I would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role.
0.58 	 We could have even had both here - one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent.
0.88 	 They could, and I believe would, have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better.<br /><br />The movie contains four stories, each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house.<br /><br />The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories.
0.87 	 The story ends with a semi-twist but I couldn't help get the sense of a script which didn't allow it to live up to its potential.<br /><br />The second story sees Peter Cushing move into the house.
0.5 	 Anyway, Cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl.
0.65 	 Without giving too much away, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role.
0.99 	 He is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies, seeing everything as cheap and fake, particularly the costumes.
0.97 	 When Pertwee puts the cloak on, he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire.
0.94 	 Ingrid Pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger.<br /><br />The linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story.
0.97 	 As weak as the linking story is, it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending.<br /><br />I'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie doesn't lie with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he's got.
0.5 	 I think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies.<br /><br />Overall, THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD, despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the Amicus anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies.
0.66 	 Ms. McTeer is the film.
0.99 	 To add to her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged.
1.0 	 In my view, conflict is what makes drama and a great story.
1.0 	 Watch the film for the sweetness, but most of all for Ms. McTeer's brilliant performance.
0.99 	 It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas.<br /><br />I've seen it In Pensylvannia way back in 1975.<br /><br />As such it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies.
0.93 	 Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion.
0.94 	 Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress.
0.96 	 He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him.
0.95 	 It's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed.
0.51 	 But I'm glad I did not miss it.<br /><br />They should re-release it with a lot more publicity.
0.95 	 I do not think they did anything to promote it.
0.99 	 Its the sort of movie that they don't make any more, and rarely did when they did.
0.64 	 Clair moves his camera around in ways that not even Busby Berkeley was doing (though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since Berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through "the real world").
0.99 	 Its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment.<br /><br />I'm sorry I can't say more.
0.88 	 The movie keeps on saying again and again, the US is God and Russia is the devil.
0.88 	 It's films like these that makes everyone think that the US is full of itself.<br /><br />This gets a 4 out of 10, and I'm being kind.
0.81 	 What's intended to be a light, frothy comedy about neighbor children who can't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood, comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-indulgence.
0.99 	 But somehow, he feels that his life is somewhat empty.
0.72 	 This film was sadly an box office disappointment, despite it had some great reviews.
0.99 	 Which sadly, i haven't had a chance to see it in a theater.
0.62 	 Even the director has a bit-part as Byran Sugarman, who's an actor himself.
0.72 	 Don't miss it.
0.75 	 (**** 1/2 out of *****).
0.7 	 When I was younger, I thought the first film was really good in childhood, so I decided to see the sequel.
0.87 	 This makes Ariel go back to the sea to find her.
0.83 	 The same good voice artists, it's just the story that could have had a bit more thought.
0.56 	 Think again.
0.99 	 This is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film-makers to poo-poo the indie film movement, and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films.<br /><br />If you're interested in films covering this subject matter, you'd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at Logo's website or renting Get Real.
1.0 	 Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues.
0.98 	 I have not read the novel, or anything other by Kurt Vonnegut, but I am now intending to start.
0.89 	 This grips you from the very first frame, and does not let go until the end credits start rolling.
0.62 	 It is well-told and well-thought out.
0.79 	 I actually really like what I've seen of this cartoon so far.
0.83 	 There's nothing wrong with the angular lines and the little black-dot eyes--in fact, I think it's really cute.
1.0 	 Sure, the show doesn't center around the original "Mystery-solving" theme, but that was just a tired old formula anyway.
0.68 	 Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but no longer only comic relief.
0.94 	 They're still cowardly, but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!)
0.62 	 intelligence.
0.99 	 Also, I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy anyway, so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does other people.
0.92 	 Fans will immediately note that they are not the same person.<br /><br />After seeing a murder in a bathroom, and also seeing the address as well, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and butter commercials, head to the house, and, sure enough, it's the same bathroom.
0.96 	 Sadly, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there.
0.96 	 It has been established right from the start that Mr Cage might be down but he is not out,and he might be broke but he will not steal,not even in his present dire circumstances.Consequently when he is mistaken by Mr J.T.
0.9 	 Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-putting & incredibly juvenile.
0.51 	 ?
0.57 	 It's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot Paulie.
0.67 	 Paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory.<br /><br />The ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise.
0.99 	 The image of movie studios being financially-driven instead of creatively is not without truth (in fact, it's more true than false).
0.69 	 Of course, Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5 hour version for wider release), but why would the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a 4 hour version that they knew few would see?
0.95 	 That is not a question that I can answer.
0.82 	 Everyone knows the story, so I will not spend much time on that.
0.96 	 However, unlike other productions of the play, stage included, this is a completely uncut production, which has never been done before.
0.97 	 According to some, Shakespeare never intended for the play to be produced uncut, leaving the decision of what to include to the director's discretion.
0.96 	 Since everything happens for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did.
0.63 	 Except Stephen King thinks so.
1.0 	 Stefan (Jens HultÃ©n) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund).
0.99 	 One day an old friend of StefanÂ´s arrives with a favor to ask him.
0.88 	 Stefan is to do a small courier job.
0.98 	 He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the Sweden-Germany customs.
0.54 	 Unfortunately things in Germany donÂ´t work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble.
1.0 	 It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern.
1.0 	 The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund.
0.93 	 The Stooges' buffoonery, McIntyre's singing, and a well-constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
0.84 	 There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex.
0.79 	 I am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too, so this helped my watch it (don't ask).
0.92 	 And last but not least if anyone see's this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn't record it.
0.93 	 Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life.
0.94 	 It is almost amazing, becoming the comic note here, how the subject of sex is avoided.
0.56 	 I don't really know why I saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try.
1.0 	 Alexandre Aja allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design.
0.99 	 In my mind, 'Aliens' was the only movie to successfully make such a transition, due to James Cameron's talent, not simply for directing the best action sequences around, but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered.
0.99 	 He was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors.
0.54 	 I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day.
0.93 	 The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child.
0.75 	 It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your acting father'.
0.68 	 Ok!
0.96 	 But what can you expect from the acting `Master D' himself.
0.76 	 `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself.
0.96 	 With half of film shoot before 1950 gone, saving the remaining films means hard choices, and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important.
0.96 	 The color shifting, lack of contrast, and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking.
0.92 	 10 out of 10, at least...
0.78 	 I thought this was a sequel of some sorts, and it is meant to be to the original from 1983.
0.95 	 The theme is still valid.
0.92 	 <br /><br />It's a generic coming-of-age story -- think "The Member of the Wedding," "Summer of '42," "A Summer Place," even "Little Women" -- and there are moments where Mulligan might have omitted the soupy music, not used slow-motion, or played down the golden-lit prettiness of the setting.
0.87 	 Nothing's forced, every line has feeling, and the pacing is just right.
0.98 	 If you find yourself misting up at the end, you don't have to feel you've been duped.
0.94 	 I've read reviews of Kerching on IMDb, and frankly,I've not seen one positive review, until now.
0.52 	 We never see him, we only hear him.
0.63 	 So many times Taj's has almost got exposed, almost.
0.96 	 I figured I would see the movies that I missed.
0.9 	 I had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that I had missed this movie at all.
0.95 	 I know I did!
0.98 	 This obvious pilot for an unproduced TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man-turned-flying demon is let loose on the world.
0.91 	 And I won't spoil it by telling you.
0.97 	 In SÃ£o Paulo, the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class, they go to a party with drugs and booze.
0.99 	 On the next day, after their classes, the date of Cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl.
0.68 	 The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid off the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, startles with Gabriel and rolls the staircase, breaking her neck.
0.8 	 The shallow, tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste.
0.67 	 Live Feed, however, SUCKED BIG TIME!
1.0 	 I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting, but hey, who's surprised?
0.76 	 And what about the story?
1.0 	 And Braindead was fun!
0.98 	 A young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up.
0.96 	 He wants his loot back.
0.61 	 He keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man's hands.
0.66 	 Sounds familiar, I'll bet.
0.96 	 Come up with something a bit different, ok guys?
0.99 	 I didn't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here...but it's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it's cult status and eventually led to a (sadly, mediocre) DVD release in 2002.
1.0 	 If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably isn't your cup of tea...but, trust me, there are worse films of this type out there...and, despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations, Trick or Treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare.
0.55 	 You'll never look at your stereo the same way again.
1.0 	 After a string of direct to video flops including, 'Little Devils''Killer Tomatoes eat France' and 'The Rescue' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy.
0.7 	 Currently he can be seen as Tom Scavo on the smash hit series 'Desperate Housewives'.
0.9 	 My God.
0.74 	 It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very, very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.<br /><br />I also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor in Next Friday.
0.98 	 even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either.
0.95 	 especially the high ratings...
0.59 	 Wow.
0.56 	 I tell you what, wow.
1.0 	 This was a classic case of something that should never have been.
0.86 	 Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker's right winged philosophies?
0.96 	 Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone.
0.95 	 Ah well, that's show business.
0.86 	 The whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop.<br /><br />It sure sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast, some good gags, and some human drama about what could have/might have been.
0.64 	 Unfortunately, there is no central event that binds them all together, like there was in "The Big Chill", one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one.
0.76 	 You end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone.
0.99 	 I saw this in the market place at the Cannes Film Festival.
0.84 	 <br /><br />Think Larry Cohen.
0.9 	 <br /><br />Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for hooking her I guess.<br /><br />The opening scene in the space-ship coming down is hilarious - you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around!
0.78 	 Most of the kids' roles are sort of cute, but not very believable.
0.7 	 The adults don't take their roles seriously at all, but this is largely a good thing.
0.93 	 Which is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />Once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie, there are actually a few standout moments of almost-not-crappiness.
0.96 	 The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious, though it's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police.
0.99 	 The butler character, while very minor, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never quite pierces through the gloom.<br /><br />Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain.
0.73 	 Thus, I give it a 3.<br /><br />That's being pretty generous, I'd say.
0.54 	 Otherwise it would be a perfect 10.<br /><br />It seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts.
1.0 	 But our language is intact, our island is our pride.
0.66 	 Puerto Rico is better off economically than any other Caribbean island!
0.98 	 I'm glad we are not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from American influence?
0.82 	 Free in true poverty, not the U.S. standard of poverty.
1.0 	 We are not victims we are resilient, humble,honest and intelligent people.
0.99 	 You had a great, awesome, bright idea but you politicized it too much.
0.78 	 We have so many things to be proud of as a people - don't bring shame to our people by victimizing us.
0.96 	 If there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph- there are many.<br /><br />Damaris Maldonado
0.7 	 The characters were all one-dimensional.
0.92 	 There are some great actors here but you would never know it.
0.99 	 I actually had quite high hopes going into this movie, so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best.
1.0 	 This tendency for Gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness.
0.96 	 The two nearly identical bathing scenes of Cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled.
1.0 	 B movie at best.
0.87 	 Sound effects are pretty good.
0.79 	 You gonna be OK Tommy.
0.86 	 "<br /><br />"You stay by the airphone, when Agent Harris calls you get me!"
0.8 	 "<br /><br />"Weapons - we need weapons.
0.94 	 Where's the silverware?
0.53 	 It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought... why not?
0.78 	 If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember... "I told you so.
0.65 	 <br /><br />Ted in Gilbert, AZ
0.93 	 I want what I can't have.
0.72 	 Not even on EBAY.
0.97 	 At least this website and Wikipedia mention it.
0.66 	 Sob.<br /><br />It was utterly appealing, funny, flirtatious, and original.
0.7 	 The dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times "you startled me" is used.
0.62 	 I HATE DONUTS" is worth repeated viewing however.
0.77 	 Sebastian (Robin Dunne), is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to New York.
0.87 	 There he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down.
0.92 	 Unfortunately he has to deal with his step-sister Kathryn (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down.
0.97 	 Sebastain starts to fall in love Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the Headmaster of the school.
0.83 	 Luckily for Amy Adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress.
0.95 	 Whilst Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon.co.uk 'a randy version of Saved by the Bell'.
0.98 	 Other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students.
0.5 	 I know that teenagers do have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or television, is treated very seriously.
0.98 	 One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie (who is around 14/15 in the film) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm.
0.66 	 Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc.
0.71 	 I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people.
1.0 	 Could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar?
0.91 	 Oh, yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart?????
0.96 	 I am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this was a good movie.
0.99 	 The 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones.
0.96 	 Using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day.
0.99 	 Well, a young woman by the name of Lisa Reisert meets a young man by the name of Jackson Rippner (nice name) at an airport.
0.96 	 One coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together.
0.9 	 Though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, Jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in Lisa's best interest to help him.<br /><br />Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck, makes him trip over chairs, and hitting him with a field hockey stick.
0.59 	 Oh, and before that, she leads him on wild chase through Miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father.
0.83 	 <br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager.
0.58 	 And why do characters like Jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening?
0.74 	 <br /><br />The actors did their best considering the movie they were given.
0.99 	 Also, I believe that Jayma Mays (who played the 'loveable' Cynthia) will be someone we will see more of.
0.56 	 The levels are tough, but not impossible.
0.55 	 I refuse to go along with the program.
0.83 	 Look at the reader comments and their star ratings: Most are 6/10, 7/10 or better.
1.0 	 I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself, which is unique.
0.59 	 How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles?
0.98 	 I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation, expecting fireworks, and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag.
0.65 	 That the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd, original and shocking in a deliberate, calculated manner goes without saying.
0.96 	 Hating the western religions of catholicism and Christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance -- Just today it was revealed that the BBC routinely skews their broadcasts with anti Christian & anti Western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness.
0.91 	 But say one negative thing about non-westernized religions, and you are toast.
0.95 	 Probably, though I will grant the artistic execution of most of it, filmed in a kind of arty Euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a Monet painting, complete with a spanning arched bridge.
0.56 	 But you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it.
0.87 	 That isn't fair, and even Clint Eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about Iwo Jima.
0.99 	 Whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes.
0.98 	 The problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it Oscars because of it's noble message -- not because it is a particularly good or original movie.<br /><br />While it may seem like an odd parallel, I see one with THE BEAST: How can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating?
0.93 	 And who cannot see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film's explosive set-piece where Beauty and the Beast finally do the nasty?
0.54 	 "Kalifonia" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.
0.93 	 Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her.<br /><br />I think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content.
0.63 	 Structurally, it's like most Fulci films you've seen.
0.98 	 Guy Richie's third proper film (not counting the God-awful "Swept Away" is a complex action thriller concerned with gambling, gangsters and chess.
0.96 	 Fans of Richie's previous efforts will probably hate Revolver as much as I did, with its twists and turns.
0.6 	 The high point of this mess of a movie is the bit in the restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favour of a superbly shot, slow-mo shootout set to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.
0.95 	 That would still be Lock, Stock.
0.99 	 This movie is in some ways similar, but makes Rain Man seem artificial, shallow, unemotional, and trivial by comparison.
0.99 	 And, I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good.
0.7 	 i was hoping that they would either keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or they would make it their own.
0.77 	 Well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.<br /><br />It started out good.
0.99 	 I love Radiohead.
0.94 	 But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys.
0.83 	 Whatever.<br /><br />He also did a bang up job with the club scene.
0.98 	 That was cool.
0.9 	 Its as simple as that.
0.71 	 and some of the others.
0.71 	 And I hate Kurt Russell.
0.8 	 The part of "Gig Young" was played by actor Byron Barr who later assumed the name before he became famous.<br /><br />Anyone interested in purchasing a copy let me know by writing to me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
0.75 	 Fortunately, the bosses at Sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent.<br /><br />From hereon in, things get progressively more complicated; the plot twists and turns and poor old Morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone.
0.86 	 It's like watching a lab experiment.
0.94 	 Some might find the contained suspense tedious, but this reviewer found it enthralling.
0.84 	 This is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies.
0.74 	 Perhaps it was that values aren't as conservative as you might think--this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes (such as the Republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine).
0.98 	 Or, perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town--as several ugly ideas such as blaming Jews for financial conspiracies, anti-Black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored.<br /><br />The small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed, but when the film makers returned six years later, the mood was depressed thanks to President Reagan.
0.55 	 Did they all see Reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative?
0.64 	 Second, while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years, so did the gross national product.
0.94 	 And, while Malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period, it was far from that, as the period from 1974-1980 featured many shortages (gas, sugar, etc.
0.98 	 While many in the media demonized Reagan (a popular sport in the 80s), the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one-sided and agenda driven.
0.95 	 Both are set in similar communities, but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones.
0.86 	 It seems in Cambodia (the subtitles in English say the character is speaking Thai but the movie says Cambodia)a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill.
1.0 	 Pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III).
0.93 	 The woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot.
0.51 	 Knives to the neck and torso.
0.86 	 Guns fired directly to the head.
0.96 	 I also like the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard).
0.66 	 In the movie the Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal...only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters.
0.99 	 At least Enos is kinda close.<br /><br />At one point they open the doors to get into the General Lee -- nuff said.<br /><br />The original show may not have been great TV, but it was entertaining and the characters made sense.
0.89 	 The producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history, or their talents.
0.75 	 This is what offended me the most.<br /><br />Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent ;)
1.0 	 When great director/actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned.
0.64 	 That might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose here.<br /><br />A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals.
0.64 	 That part could also have used a little explaining as well.
0.65 	 But he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl.<br /><br />Bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper.
1.0 	 A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history.
0.69 	 But that's another terribly big hole in the plot.<br /><br />Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez.
1.0 	 I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman.
1.0 	 It is great!
0.96 	 When Jim tosses that little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless.
0.57 	 Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman?
1.0 	 Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see.
0.97 	 I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious.
0.95 	 Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman?
1.0 	 Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots.
0.92 	 Unlike Harlin's "Elm Street 4", and "Die Hard 2" which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie.
0.6 	 That, my friends, is a script.
1.0 	 Lithgow played one of the best villains in "Ricochet", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here.
0.93 	 How is that possible?
0.81 	 I've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance.
0.81 	 I know this because I have witnessed it in "Days of Thunder", but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards.
0.56 	 Has it come to this?
0.97 	 When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability.
0.88 	 The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all.
0.92 	 <br /><br />It then cuts to the inside of a British cockpit, badly hit, up in flames and with the co-pilot already dead.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences.
1.0 	 The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell.
0.85 	 The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk.
0.65 	 These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable.
0.97 	 It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout.
0.66 	 Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship.
0.76 	 Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up.
0.94 	 Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver.
0.99 	 But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
0.6 	 Even is she's been in only six.
0.89 	 It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S.
0.99 	 I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings.
0.82 	 The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else.
0.96 	 It definitely needed to be interesting.
0.96 	 I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows.
0.72 	 which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face.
0.96 	 My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I got together with a bunch of my friends which are NBB haters and had a big bonfire and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead".
0.56 	 She's really pretty.
0.6 	 But still, you guys reak!
1.0 	 MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately.
0.68 	 This film was loathed from day one.
0.7 	 While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds (aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism), the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do.
0.83 	 It's not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE, or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS.
1.0 	 MYRA takes for granted that Hollywood is a corrupt town, but goes further to attack such beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy, Shirley Temple, Judy Garland and Gary Cooper.
0.98 	 Like CASINO ROYALE; SKI-DOO; I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS and other would-be hip epics, MYRA is a middle-aged vision of the hippy-dippy youth culture.
0.78 	 It tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles.
1.0 	 MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has the humor of a bully; there's not a single moment of innocence in it.
0.84 	 Its intentions aren't honorable.
1.0 	 No one will ever accuse Welch of being a great actress, but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered.
1.0 	 Being in almost every scene, Welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film, but to her credit, she gives a remarkably nuanced performance.
0.95 	 The whole story is a fantasy fable, which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver, but what that might be is anybody's guess.
0.97 	 Not just movies as a business, but movies as part of the culture as well.
0.83 	 The film itself is wall-to-wall arcane references to old movies, all of which director-screenwriter Sarne approaches with a seething disdain.
0.96 	 He has raided the film vaults of 20th Century-Fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films, not as an homage or to provide a social commentary, but to mock the innocence of old Hollywood.
0.97 	 How can an artist -- if you generously want to call Sarne that -- make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in?
0.53 	 It hates Hollywood, it hates America, it hates sex, it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and, well, you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it.
0.92 	 In a very sad and sorry way, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto, a celebration of pop culture nihilism.
0.91 	 I laughed the whole time.
0.91 	 Because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer, it doesn't have the clichÃ©s that are expected of other comedies, which was such a relief.
0.64 	 Don't you?
0.99 	 No analyzing, no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning.
0.61 	 But don't trash it here when you and I both know you liked it.
0.86 	 That could even be a metaphor for this second-rate King Kong movie from Toho studios' stalwart director Ishiro Honda.
0.99 	 Essentially it's a warm up for "King Kong versus Godzilla".
1.0 	 The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada, who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagaki's iconic version of "Chushingura" (47 Ronin) and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda.
0.94 	 We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada, who it seemed like she kind of preferred.
1.0 	 Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself.
0.8 	 She discovers a nice trick: if you talk to a giant ape really..... really.... slowly..... he'll understand what you're saying.
0.95 	 Dr. Who builds Mecha-Kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way, so they decide to go for the real Kong.
1.0 	 It's a nice looking movie, I'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing, which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways.
0.84 	 But I didn't get 'it'.<br /><br />A few decades go by and man, how I know how much I didn't get in this film!!
0.92 	 Ya don't.
0.94 	 Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the "f" word but what did you expect, Emily Post's finishing school for him and his co-horts?
0.74 	 Look at how they CAME to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to.
0.7 	 Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it..it all its violent, lying, stealing, crooked, thieving glory.<br /><br />The part of the film that personified the 1980's to me, is the money laundering.
0.91 	 Tony's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank.
0.95 	 At the clubs where he spent and drank?
0.85 	 Nope.
0.57 	 Money was money and with money, you get the power.
0.94 	 Tony was living high off the hog.
0.74 	 He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer.<br /><br />After Tony Montana's rise to power, he finds out its really crappy up there.
0.89 	 It's violent, bloody, overly so..but it drives the point disturbingly home.
0.84 	 Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80's were anything like Tony Montana.
1.0 	 But the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to "be somebody" and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America.<br /><br />Makes you wonder -- has anything from then -- been learned today?
0.99 	 and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives.<br /><br />The answers, while seeming to be boring and mundane, are actually quite funny, when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later.<br /><br />How many of these animals look like the person making the statements?
0.94 	 One of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman, "I like them kind of thin."
0.92 	 is an insect, the Walking Stick.<br /><br />There are two dogs discussing odors and smells, while sniffing the behind of a poodle, as they talk about the different smells of a woman.<br /><br />There are two birds in a cage.
0.81 	 talk about your waste of money.. im just wondering why Michael would star in such a turkey of a movie..Michael is a Great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer.. that was wonderful.
0.99 	 as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor.. so what made him do this one???
0.94 	 i watched it and thought it was really dumb.. i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies .. especially "The Squeeze" i didnt understand that one At all, and i feel his best performance was in "Pacific Heights" , his character really creeped me out.. and i really enjoyed "Multiplicity".
0.63 	 If you haven't seen this obscure little charmer, you should seek it out.
0.81 	 It is the story of a bumbling, wartime Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) who is listed 4-F each time he attempts to join any branch of the military.
0.5 	 He finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more bumbling than MacMurray is, sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants.
0.94 	 That is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing British school.
0.99 	 Yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life.
0.98 	 But one bone to pick.
0.98 	 No matter how many .50 bullets they fired I never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts!
0.58 	 It hurt the realism, but I can live with it.
0.97 	 If you have ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked.
0.87 	 People of the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it).
0.54 	 Believe me now!
0.67 	 If not, you will believe me later!<br /><br />Brian Avenet-Bradley might be quite a good business man.
0.58 	 Otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies.
0.99 	 Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly I'm appalled.
0.65 	 Let me tell u something.
0.53 	 Then we have The Sopranos.
0.98 	 There is no department that this show doesn't excel in.
0.93 	 Then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before.
0.99 	 Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T.V.
0.92 	 And yet here he plays a throwaway character, almost a forgotten man.
1.0 	 His father used to snore, and when he misses him he lies awake, pretending to snore.
0.98 	 Shin-ae seems not to realize the danger she is in.<br /><br />Something terrible happens.
0.58 	 But it happens and she must face the consequences.
0.95 	 But she can't.
0.98 	 A perpetrator is caught, but that's no consolation.
0.75 	 Eventually she becomes so despairing, she relents and goes to a born-again Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend.
0.97 	 She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion.
1.0 	 It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of "Asiatic Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" and then "abruptly and without warning" turns into "something of a thriller, and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering."
1.0 	 But that progression not only seems random and indigestible; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out, with no sense of an ending.
0.99 	 Shin-ae takes foolish chances with her son, and makes bad choices all along.
0.9 	 If she is destined for madness like Betty in Jean-Jacques Beineix's Betty Blue, which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices, that isn't something that is properly developed.
0.91 	 I'd rather have one of those cars, too.
0.95 	 I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big D was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long.
0.52 	 I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance.
1.0 	 Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you'd have to be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film.
0.99 	 Unbelievably, this won a jury award at the festival.
0.97 	 You can bet it did not win an audience award.
0.71 	 The animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however, the story was too long, way too confusing, and over the top dramatic.
1.0 	 Go rent a Miyazaki film and watch it twice, you'll get way more out of it.
0.59 	 Wow.
0.95 	 I LOVED the whole series, and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly.
0.95 	 Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5, while remaining better than anything else on television.
0.58 	 Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony.
0.97 	 A tip of the pork pie to Mr. Chase.
0.79 	 I immediately knew what I would be renting out.
0.98 	 My only qualm (I suppose I expected it) is that it was dubbed (AAARGh) and not subtitled.
0.69 	 Elsewise, the movie's original/strange/cool plot, and full on action made it one of Jet Li's better movies... even though they all fall under that category....
0.79 	 With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I didn't even get that.
0.74 	 Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them.
0.9 	 it has a TV-movie feeling to it.
0.56 	 the idea of the UN as being taken over by Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible.
0.66 	 if you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like this, at least make it a quality one!
0.53 	 can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago, and there isn't really much to say about this film other than.....skip it!
0.98 	 This 1997 film-blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well-deserved legendary status as one of the screen's greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love.
1.0 	 The pervasive, ongoing and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and what's-her-name is sure to set many a viewer's heart a-flutter with memories of one's own first crush.
0.82 	 Scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again.
1.0 	 As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (to which this masterpiece is so often compared), the closeups of the actors' faces as they experience the slow dawning of the great love-that-is-not-to-be will haunt you forever.
1.0 	 to the eternal, bittersweet tale of Love Interrupted.<br /><br />Dare I advance what I perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this critically-acclaimed triumph of modern cinema?
0.87 	 'Citizen Kane' had its 'Rosebud' .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.99 	 'Runaway Car' should have its catchword as well.
0.66 	 The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims.
0.99 	 Then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods, soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son.
0.98 	 Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute.
0.98 	 He sets Bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on.<br /><br />This Movie is only recommended to those who enjoy B grade 80's Slashers.
0.7 	 <br /><br />Nor does service to the Reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the Ostfront will learn.
0.63 	 Years later Ruth's daughter Hannah sets out in search of her mother's past and meets 90 year old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war.<br /><br />I did deem it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront.
0.88 	 Where are the cars?
0.53 	 Where are the chases?
0.91 	 Where's the tension?
0.93 	 The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones, man....this is the baddest, coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction.
1.0 	 The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away.
1.0 	 The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers!
0.6 	 Go find the original.
0.99 	 Or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN.
0.92 	 The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged.
0.86 	 Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money, all those resources, all that experience, and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $250,000?
1.0 	 Where I was once excited to see Coyote Ugly, Remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor, now I say: God help us all.
0.66 	 <br /><br />
0.72 	 And that is pretty sad ,specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air ( think in "The Simple life ") I admit that are many similarities with this show and "The Simpsons" ,but despite the similarities ,the show have it own merits .
0.99 	 What a shame .
0.64 	 So I bought me a copy.
0.85 	 I think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it.
0.68 	 The make up is for that kind of flick well done.
0.59 	 The acting is criminal, the direction practically non-existent, and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer.<br /><br />Far be it from me to stifle creativity, but I actually believe things like this shouldn't be made.
1.0 	 I was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness, a hint of fun, and even some energy.
0.99 	 His parents then send him off to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax.
0.99 	 (Thank goodness).<br /><br />That summary is as good as the "film" gets (and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is).
0.82 	 <br /><br />And those "special" effects.
0.96 	 Well, they're "special" all right.
0.99 	 And done by a person who I can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology.
0.61 	 It is not the same as the other films about dancing.
0.55 	 The town's people leave him alone.
0.97 	 His new position doesn't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge.
0.96 	 I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals.
0.88 	 Not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film, always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so.
0.82 	 comedy and I really, really dug that.
0.99 	 I could really get into this melodrama stuff.
0.74 	 Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago I immediately wanted to turn it off.
0.71 	 As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so, I realized that the actor playing Navin stole the show.
0.95 	 He has this "Marty Feldman" thing going for him but MUCH, MUCH more talent...taking nothing away from Marty.
0.54 	 The movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original Jerk, but then again, it was SO MUCH MORE.
0.9 	 I really think that if this movie was released first, and I saw the Steve Martin movie 2nd, I'd think the 2nd was a cheap rip-off.
0.61 	 I didn't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was messing around on the Trinity board when I saw some user mention how the Wes Craven series is a lot better then the 'crap' that's Blade, So I did my quick research: Checked the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000.
1.0 	 I also noticed that within the Wes Craven Dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores I was seeing.<br /><br />Now let's take a quick personal recap here.
0.96 	 I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking it at all, and then seeing the scores of Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion.<br /><br />A couple of things I went in knowing when I started watching this movie was that it's low budget, so because of that, I'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v/fx and just figure it's going to compensated by story & acting, I was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee)<br /><br />Oh geez
 This movie was CHEESY!
0.87 	 Oh the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
0.52 	 For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichÃ©s and predictability.<br /><br />The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.<br /><br />The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry Â this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry Â in New Zealand!
0.54 	 Is there any chance of something at least half decently made, semi believable and most important ORIGINAL?!?
0.9 	 Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows, but it was because of this, among some other financial and creative woes, that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971.
0.97 	 That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored, but it's not at all a fault of Kurosawa's.<br /><br />The material in Dodes'ka-den is absorbing, but not in ways that one usually finds from the director, and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot.
0.96 	 And of course there's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum, not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it's about something erotic with a guy.
0.71 	 As far as bad/cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own.
0.89 	 A real gem!<br /><br />First off, the film wasn't originally in English.
1.0 	 That's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional!
1.0 	 Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog (and there is plenty more where this came from)
 "I'm feeling a little better.
0.74 	 I'm just thirsty
 FOR YOUR BLOOD!
0.52 	 "<br /><br />And what drama!
0.96 	 and all 10 army guys, one at a time, drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries!
0.94 	 Instant classic!<br /><br />And don't worry.
0.63 	 This movie even had a hip/upbeat '80's keyboard/synth soundtrack to set the mood!<br /><br />And trust me
 I realize this review might contain some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratched the surface.
0.97 	 A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade!
0.99 	 A true movie watching experience!
1.0 	 A masterpiece!
0.72 	 The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre.
0.98 	 At first glance, it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity-themed morality comedies of Cecil B.
0.58 	 And like Eisenstein, the editing style seems to suggest sound Â for example when a split-second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in, we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring.<br /><br />There is also a contrast, particularly with silent films from the US, in that The Ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards.
0.87 	 And it's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting, it's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing, particularly with point-of-view shots, as well as some strong yet subtle performances.
1.0 	 There are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices (particularly double exposures), many of which were unnecessary, but there is far less of this than there is in The Lodger.<br /><br />Let's make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors.
0.89 	 In spite of his talent I was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role, as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist!
0.82 	 But that just goes to show how much I know, as it turns out Brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting.
0.96 	 If you walk into this even fifteen minutes late, you'll be in for a shock, the movie will have already began.
0.93 	 You don't want to miss the first few jokes, assuming you came to not miss any jokes.<br /><br />Wow!
0.84 	 I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending.
0.96 	 The plot outline goes like this, there is this man, and not to give away any spoilers, (*Spoiler Alert!!
0.97 	 *) (he hasn't had any sex ever(!)
0.7 	 they use this plot device to set the story moving, and there are (intentionally or not, it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters, some containing irony, and jokes, and awkward situations, you know.<br /><br />The director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog, some music, and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between.
0.74 	 (spoilers?
0.58 	 )<br /><br />while the historical accuracy might be questionable... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate LOTR.. such things are more easily excused now) I liked the art ness of it.
0.58 	 Though not really an art house film.
0.85 	 <br /><br />I have two complaints.
0.89 	 It's too short.
0.52 	 Capt.
0.99 	 Gallagher (Lemmon) and flight attendant Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) are a supposedly hot item in this death trip; a luxury 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub-slash-hotel
 there's even a blind piano player who falls in love.
0.98 	 '<br /><br />The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but not much goes on in between.
0.82 	 Hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel, but I forget the reason why not
 He would've done wonders for the 1970 original, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('77 also got inspiration from `The Flight of the Phoenix').
1.0 	 <br /><br />Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite from their days on `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte' (apparently here they are not playing heavies, just reunited ÂAutumn Years' lovers).
0.92 	 I also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the United Kingdom, whilst dross is passed off as quality material.<br /><br />But don't get me started on that...
0.59 	 ...And that's why hard to rate.
0.81 	 It is filled with good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor.
0.57 	 A lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this film for a fun time.
0.89 	 Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
0.97 	 It seems to combine comedy, drama, and satire, but it sure doesn't add up to much.
0.88 	 What a waste.<br /><br />The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic.
0.85 	 The film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $5.6 million-budgeted picture went on to gross over $150 million at the box office and won an Academy Award and five Golden Globes.
0.98 	 If you're looking for an actress/singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance, Streisand is definitely the girl you want.
0.93 	 She's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural, and, as usual, she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer.
0.81 	 Kristofferson's solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless, however, that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline.<br /><br />Though naturally dated in some respects (it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made), the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN still holds up remarkably well.
0.58 	 Every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead.
0.79 	 This was the first "Walking Tall" movie I saw, I think in a $2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd.
0.57 	 , so I didn't have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker.
0.72 	 Being born in the 1960's I grew up watching the TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan's School for Girls", "Kolchak the Night Stalker", etc, but this one is just plain dumb.This is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier.
0.99 	 The movie stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach.
0.93 	 The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family.
0.96 	 Ignore this if it ever airs on TV.
0.88 	 Appereantly it's a 'Cinderella story' but I most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie.
0.61 	 The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling, that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance, when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios.<br /><br />Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines.
0.98 	 It had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up.
0.88 	 People came out of the theater smiling.
0.92 	 There is no reason to smile.
0.97 	 The General did that suffering far less US Military losses then any other allied commander in the War in the Pacific!
0.85 	 Told by his subordinates that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by Communist Chinese troops Gen. MacArthur pressed on anyway until that attack did materialized cutting the US & UN forces to ribbons.
1.0 	 Truman who had taken just about enough garbage from Gen. MacArthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was mishandling the war in not going all out, like MacArthur wanted him to, against the Red Chinese this was the last straw!
0.7 	 With the horrors of a nuclear war now, in 1950/51, a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out, like Gen. MacArthur wanted to, against the Red Chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would engulf not only the US USSR & Red China but the entire world!
0.93 	 It was that important reality of future war that Gen. MacArthur was never taught, since the A and H Bomb weren't yet invented, in West Point.<br /><br />Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after finishing his commencement speech at West Point, had become both an older and wiser soldier as well as , since his retirement from the US Military, elder statesman in his feeling about war and the utter futility of it.
0.61 	 In that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it.
0.95 	 STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />This second instalment of the Che films moves the story forward to the late 60s, where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of South America, surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group.
0.97 	 There's just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up.
0.78 	 This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton" whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant.
1.0 	 While many here have canned Madoona for all her acting I think that in films like "A League of Their own" was quite good and enjoyable and "Who's That Girl" showed a quirkiness of Madonna's style not shown before or afterwards.
1.0 	 The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the underused Billy Dee Williams faring best.
0.94 	 The locations are great, the effects and action are weak.
0.98 	 It could be remade as a very good film, and, as it stands, is an interesting effort.
0.94 	 But now the two are on shore leave.
0.85 	 Their dancing on this one is absolute magic.<br /><br />I'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was.
0.96 	 Then again she didn't even keep her own name.
0.84 	 <br /><br />Neither Ozzie or Harriet sang on television.
0.99 	 Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer, but Harriet could really carry a tune.
0.86 	 The industry dropped the ball on this.
0.79 	 The trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens.
0.92 	 Which gave it no chance to be seen.
0.52 	 Some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good.
0.95 	 Maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on DVD or cable.
0.93 	 If you haven't see this movie you should.
0.8 	 Great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie.
0.95 	 It could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films.
0.74 	 Even though Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic.
0.82 	 See this movie and if you like, recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year.
0.71 	 It is o.k.
0.73 	 if you are o.k.
0.98 	 I remembered this show from when i was a kid.
0.99 	 for some reason i remembered it being really intense.
0.56 	 also it was on really really early in the morning up in PA.
0.86 	 I finally, after looking around the web for a long time, found an episode.
0.85 	 the first episode no-less.
0.51 	 Criminey!
0.99 	 it was obviously just made to show kids playing lazer tag and having a great time.
0.99 	 the show opens with bhodi li telling his mommy "my names not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR!!!!!"
0.95 	 what can i say......THE LIGHT SHINES!!!!!!!!!!
0.51 	 !
0.98 	 I rather think not.
0.89 	 News seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen: much more TV time is given to an earthquake in Italy, say, than one ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia, say.
0.98 	 Greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster.
0.96 	 However, it is not pro-American either.
0.96 	 Instead of learning that the USA cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere, its political leaders, aided and abetted by Blair (and even Aznar) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, which is not doing any good to anyone in Afghanistan or Irak at present, let alone much elsewhere.
0.91 	 The White House mentality is totally rejectable: the US and UK invaded Irak and caused all the chaos, and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the UN and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil.
0.92 	 <br /><br />The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives.
1.0 	 This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture.
0.9 	 Wow...<br /><br />I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early.
0.97 	 Time and again, characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking.
1.0 	 Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes.
0.68 	 One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including London.
0.99 	 On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while.
0.99 	 I read the back of the box and it talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron.
1.0 	 I thought, "wonderful!
1.0 	 This will be great!"
0.72 	 Not that those aren't good movie qualities, but please!
0.6 	 Where was the story?
0.88 	 is it that mr. henson is just so very missed?
0.71 	 Stalker is right!
0.98 	 Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as I've ever seen from him.
0.63 	 After this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses, whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut.
0.97 	 The makeup is quite good, and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic.
0.88 	 There is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river, and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open.
0.77 	 There's not much to wet yourself over though, most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening.
0.94 	 <br /><br />No, The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all.
0.88 	 I'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it.
1.0 	 If you want a TRUE sci-fi/horror cult classic, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
0.72 	 The special effects were a direct rip-off of "The ring."
0.61 	 The story?
0.98 	 Surprise, the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love.
0.96 	 The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities.
0.9 	 The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures).
0.96 	 Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good.
1.0 	 Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.
0.63 	 He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy.
0.88 	 I believe I received this film when I was a young buck.
0.68 	 I remembered watching it as a child, but i could never find the film.
0.98 	 I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck.
0.84 	 All the time actually.
0.96 	 And personally I think they should make a sequel.
0.74 	 Mmm, yes a sequel indeed.
0.98 	 Now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body!
0.92 	 Forbidden Siren is based upon the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s) game.
0.98 	 Like most video game turned movies, I would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well.
1.0 	 And that goes for this one too, painfully.<br /><br />There's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story, and the mysterious island on which a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) come to move into.
0.98 	 Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience.
1.0 	 There are two ways a twist will make you feel - it either elevates the movie to a memorable level, or provides you with that hokey feeling.
0.5 	 Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter.<br /><br />The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be that explicit - it's still not worth the time, so better to avoid this.
0.68 	 this is one of the funnier films i've seen.
0.86 	 the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin.
0.66 	 There is precious little beyond a short.<br /><br />After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again.
0.95 	 It's amazing that after that left the theatre, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, get ready for bed,and know that the audience was STILL trapped in the theatre.<br /><br />It's not enough to indulge your vision.
0.99 	 You have to give the audience enough to share your vision.
0.97 	 When was Boss Hogg evil?
0.98 	 When was Rosco a tough guy?
0.51 	 !
0.63 	 It should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes.
0.9 	 It is very, very x5 low budget.
0.68 	 Many scenes were way, way too long.
0.93 	 This is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji,and Godzilla vs. megalon despite their higher budgets.
0.5 	 The Why-Did-I-Ever-See-This-Piece-Of-Zombie-Dung-Blues.
0.51 	 -infinity/10
0.89 	 And the oxygen in ship was running short.
0.59 	 They had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks, etc, etc.<br /><br />First of all, this movie's plot is not possible in real life.
0.93 	 It does not look unreal.
0.83 	 It is about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you won't even notice.
0.98 	 Seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all.
0.9 	 It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film.<br /><br />OK, so the acting isn't in the style a blockbuster.
0.9 	 That's because the actors are seemingly real people.
0.74 	 More of these please!
0.84 	 old) what a actress.
0.75 	 Polanski was always a master at building unease, and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy.
0.79 	 There's some James Bond type of evil mastermind Â who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison.
0.93 	 There's also a villainous monk with a whip, dressed like a communist KKK member, getting rid of the leftover characters, like overly curious teachers and such, as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach.
0.66 	 Seriously, if I had known sooner that these Krimi films were so colorful and crazy, I would have purchased a whole collection of them already.
0.62 	 Joanna Pakula's character seems to have an I.Q.
0.98 	 And the plot isn't even in the way.<br /><br />What plot there is involves two Air Force enlisted men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist as well as half of the town's.
0.69 	 Yup, Cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image.<br /><br />This is the oldest of clichÃ©s when you say they don't make them like this any more, but they really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract.
0.9 	 In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting, that nearly nobody's live is as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like other people to believe.
0.77 	 And that every live has its dark and often depressing sides.
0.57 	 I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that's proto-fascist: The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers, who are turned off by the body of a 70+ year old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover.
0.75 	 An expedition led by hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition.
1.0 	 They meet beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them.
0.7 	 I caught this on late night TV when I was about 10.
0.52 	 Seeing it again all these years later I can see why.
0.61 	 A sure fire cure for insomnia.
0.96 	 Okay, when I came on the board for this movie, I was really expecting people to be making fun of it.
1.0 	 I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it.
0.89 	 I looked up the dates and while in reality, he is only about four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed much larger.
0.68 	 Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF, she seemed like 10 or 12... she seemed like a little kid!
0.99 	 That there is any way that Kristi Yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl.
0.6 	 Fysicaly he also looks in top-shape.
0.72 	 He also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie.
0.74 	 I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments.
0.98 	 Is the experience worthwhile in any way?
0.86 	 Dialogs?
0.94 	 Many amateurs actually do better.<br /><br />It's really the direction that puzzles.
0.55 	 I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward.
0.99 	 Die hard fans of "Blair Witch" are better off following Daniel Myrick.
0.86 	 Although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than SÃ¡nchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).
0.55 	 He refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion.<br /><br />Such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition, but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful.<br /><br />I'm not a Catholic, but I thought the recital of the hail Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end, with the Lord's prayer, was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster.<br /><br />I don't see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Viet Nam war.<br /><br />I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.
0.74 	 I borrowed (slightly modified) title from some other comment.
0.58 	 Sure, it isn't always true, but ...
0.99 	 It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction).
0.96 	 As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of "how is he going to tell her such and such" might get in the way of the comedy.
0.99 	 It doesn't.
0.84 	 But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from.
0.93 	 Some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature, but then again, that's basically what most of the Matrix series has done, and it's been a driving force behind its success.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0.87 	 The plot went a different direction in this movie, as Dirty Harry doesn't take as much of a police approach this time around.
0.71 	 Bradford Dillman seemed to change his name to Captain Briggs here, either way, he wasn't any different.
0.71 	 Jack Thibeau was well cast as Kruger, a pervert.
1.0 	 Now for the really bad part.
1.0 	 Sandra Locke, Eastwood's long-time lover was horribly miscast as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love interest.
1.0 	 And Paul Drake was just horrible as Mick.<br /><br />The movie would have been so much better if not for better writing and acting on some parts.<br /><br />8/10.
0.71 	 I saw the trailer for this film a few months prior to its release, and MAN, did it look scary, Especially how this film was based on a real life phenomenon.
0.89 	 The advertisements for the movie did both, which lead to my ultimate disappointment.<br /><br />By no means is this "the most disturbing movie in years".
0.97 	 Hell, I doubt it was the most disturbing movie of that week's release.
0.85 	 I must admit, it held my interest and Micheal Keaton was believable as a man searching for answers by supernatural means.
0.98 	 After John's wife dies, he learns about EVP, which transmits the voices of the dead into everyday electronic appliances.
1.0 	 He all of the sudden receives messages from his wife!
0.9 	 My God!
0.93 	 It's not just his wife reaching him, it's other dead people.
0.81 	 A movie about helping dead people.
0.73 	 Come on, give me a break!
0.75 	 There's also the obligatory clock-stopping-at-the-same-exact-time-every-night trick and three evil spirits that menace our hero.
0.99 	 There's also an ending message with a message saying how only 1 out of X voices heard through EVP are threatening, with a nice happy tune playing.
1.0 	 Way to break the mood, you guys.
0.95 	 This review may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well.
0.95 	 Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well.
1.0 	 Halicki's original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 version that made it great.
0.78 	 Amateurish in the extreme.
0.67 	 At one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected Al-Quada operatives, and thus get an interview with Osama.
0.94 	 I found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws.
1.0 	 Ashley Judd, in an early role and I think her first starring role, shows her real-life rebellious nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera.
0.52 	 Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme Liberalism or what?<br /><br />Being a staunch feminist in real life, she must have cherished this script.
0.98 	 The subject is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles.
1.0 	 Wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to "escape" from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence -- something almost everyone can relate to.
0.89 	 That's enough to get most people to watch.
0.96 	 The filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming, and this particular one, waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords.
0.51 	 It's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care.
0.59 	 However, the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand.
1.0 	 I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally make for an entertaining action movie.
0.96 	 Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, who is the brother of a victim from the first film.
0.85 	 The film's dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it's worth.
0.93 	 Nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty, with Stanley as clever as ever, using his brains to commandeer a film production, killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work, letting no one stand in his way..that is until Alison realizes who Stanley really is.
0.84 	 Alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject..what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do such a thing, and what led such a man down this dark path?
1.0 	 The humor of Alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller.
0.81 	 Of course, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer's fate(..quite a hard pill to swallow).
0.91 	 This sequel, to me, just wasn't on target as much as the original, with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious.
0.92 	 I was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on DVD.
0.59 	 If you HAVE to watch this thing, do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers, you may then glean some enjoyment from it.
0.99 	 <br /><br />I found the dialogue hilarious, lodged in my mind is the introduction of Cremator.
0.65 	 While he is a "slave" of the chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge.<br /><br />What I love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives' villages and their way-of-life (they walked naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was: in a gorgeous garden-of-eden, life was messy, violent, full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs.
0.89 	 There is no romanticized "noble savages" or "heroic explorers" here, it is just people trying to survive in a tough world.<br /><br />The movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives.
0.95 	 I have to say that Holly blew Trade out of the water.
0.89 	 Just listening to conversations after the screening, people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation.
0.7 	 But her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused.
0.92 	 After that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her.
0.89 	 In the end though, they find out the truth.
1.0 	 Steve(Dean Russell)and his buddy Charlie(John Batis)get into a playful argument with their wives, Sharon(Tomi Barrett, the late real-life wife of Gary Kent))& Teddi(Ann Wilkinson)over surviving in the woods camping by themselves.
0.7 	 Falling prey to John, Teddi is soon killed as Sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck's overheating.
0.99 	 Afraid, tired, and paranoid, Sharon receives some very unusual assistance..John's ghost children!
0.99 	 That's right, John's children remain in the wilderness, ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods, taking a special liking to Sharon, helping guide her to safety and her friends.
0.81 	 Meanwhile, Steve and Charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where John lives.
0.58 	 Cooking over a burning fire, the meat simmering is actually from Charlie's wife, Teddi!
0.52 	 Unknowingly Charlie eats from the meat when offered by John who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place!
0.99 	 Meanwhile, John goes a hunting, with Charlie, Steve, and Sharon in a fight for survival.
0.74 	 Charlie, unfortunately, doesn't have such friends.<br /><br />Director Donald Jones(..who also wrote it and went broke funding the film)smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking, gorgeous location in the Sequoia National Park, in California, where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights, and I basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose.
0.57 	 Within such a picturesque landscape, to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac, that kind of increases the terror.
0.99 	 City folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place, to smell the clean, fresh air, enjoy the sights of a lovely view, only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife.
0.98 	 Providing the back-story to why John is the monster he is, Jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and reacting accordingly(..she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children, wishing to punish them for "being naughty")killing both her and the lover in bed(..a refrigerator repairman).
0.86 	 The children, sad and depressed committed suicide and now "haunt" the wilderness, still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose.
0.99 	 I realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some, but I found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious.
0.99 	 I mean I could react to the situation they were in, because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well.
0.99 	 I think the film is similar in many ways to DON'T GO INTO THE WOODS..ALONE!, except that THE FOREST has the aforementioned ghost children(..their voices echo when talking to Sharon, their father, or each other).
1.0 	 I don't really think it's particularly memorable, for the exception of the ghost children.
0.83 	 While having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour (don't ask) she goes off the road and ends up in the Thames.
0.97 	 She survives--he doesn't.
0.99 	 Naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow.<br /><br />This movie was doomed before it even opened.
0.99 	 It took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (Morrissey complained about the movie often).
1.0 	 Still it's not too bad.
0.6 	 It's a lot like the first--there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an R), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting--but there's no impact.
1.0 	 It feels like a retread of the first.
0.96 	 People are being killed here with a choker leash (I believe)...just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first.
0.98 	 People just attacked this because Stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to "Basic..." 14 years after it was made.
0.8 	 I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me, she's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A.
0.95 	 "Le Kiss of Death" for *ANY* movie.
0.98 	 Despite my instincts, and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand, yet another cinematic "tour de force" starring Lisa Raye, I rented it anyway.
0.58 	 The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!)
0.97 	 and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death.
0.96 	 To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town.
0.53 	 One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping.<br /><br />The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes?
0.96 	 Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout "The debt is paid", etc.
0.85 	 This is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal "YES!"
0.92 	 Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life.
1.0 	 Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the States) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany.
0.84 	 Apparently to show his human side.
0.83 	 OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part.
0.99 	 The part where he stands up for his faith.
0.51 	 drum-roll.....waiting..... ....waiting.....ZIP.
1.0 	 Hardly fitting for a hero of the Faith.
0.83 	 The bad news is, it was dead at birth.<br /><br />If Ed Wood had come out of retirement and coached George Romaro through his classic 'Night of the Living Dead,' this is what we might have come up with.
0.89 	 A rural California sheriff finds a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community.
0.55 	 <br /><br />Meanwhile, every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re-enacted-poorly.
0.75 	 The supposed infrared scenes from the demon's viewpoint are nothing special 
 and he/she/it sure seems to back up a lot (as opposed to turning around the moving forward).
0.65 	 This one, I now see, is rated 1.5 on a 10-scale.
0.92 	 I fear this might be a tad generous!
0.99 	 This is probably why her homely older sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home!
0.96 	 I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who pitched for the Cincinnati Reds?
0.96 	 Although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly, it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look, how they should be structured and how they should be acted.
0.97 	 For one thing, many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative, and were overburdened with title cards.
0.99 	 If he thought a story was silly, he just did it half-arsed.
0.98 	 McLaglen's performance does not look like much, being as it is about 90% drunk act.
0.99 	 McLaglen is backed by a spot-on supporting cast, among whom there are no weak links.
0.88 	 Thanks to this, we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti-hero at its centre, which could easily have been a clunky, over-earnest mess, instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world.
0.74 	 One of the many vigilante epics that flooded the market by the mid-80s.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.67 	 Danny Glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy.
0.9 	 Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story.
0.91 	 I thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded.
0.9 	 He also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate, while things around him literally go to ruins.
0.93 	 An eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it's luster before any type of horror transpires, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich...
0.53 	 thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end.
0.98 	 ", and when Kelso yells "burn!
0.66 	 Dumbland is not for all.

0.71 	 Yes.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.5 	 Absurd?
0.71 	 Yes.

0.51 	 huh?
0.82 	 I once used Wesley Snipes' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new, untried film in which he appears.
0.75 	 Greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films.
0.68 	 My fear had come to pass.
0.6 	 But the "Bourne Franchise," as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast, big bucks.<br /><br />Read my lips, you Hollywood types.
0.97 	 The chances are good I won't hear it again: I certainly won't ever view "The Contractor" again.<br /><br />I recommend to those of you who have yet to see "The Contractor": just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life.<br /><br />2 out of 10; I am tempted to lower that to a 1.
0.9 	 To be honest, the book is better..
1.0 	 The story and the script apparently had potential to be funny, but though managing at some points, in other places it failed.
0.97 	 You could see them wanting to make a joke, but no one in the audience laughed.
0.57 	 <br /><br />OK, that gives a more negative feeling than what I actually had watching the movie.
0.69 	 I enjoyed it; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket.
0.99 	 when she told him she'd "get him a new one" after a wild night in bed, ending up breaking the bed and leaving Matt sore.<br /><br />I cannot, however, agree with bgs1614,who says that the film could earn an 'R' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that.
1.0 	 Some sexual acts yes, but nothing explicit, only humorous, and no nudity whatsoever.
0.98 	 I didn't really expect anything from either one - I was a big fan of the original Superman films and the trailer for Click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic (which I wouldn't oppose) film.
0.68 	 The jokes also work much better than in Ex-girlfriend, both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones.<br /><br />Anyway, the only reason I compared these three films is that they are the three last ones I've seen, within a very short period, and also because I went to all of these with basically no expectations at all.
0.95 	 Of course the British character is normal.
0.95 	 The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes.
0.54 	 A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically.
0.78 	 <br /><br />The next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when Connie Martin, Sherry's sister, is refused entry into Paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman.
0.91 	 The party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from Bake and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company.
0.85 	 Bake takes it upon himself to help Sherry out by tampering with her water, making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition.
0.77 	 In addition to Bake's mistake, Connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping Bilge would take over as captain.
0.8 	 jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now.
0.85 	 1 out of 10 is too high, way too high.
0.99 	 This documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation.
0.99 	 There it is reduced, apparently, to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered Wall Street job can make your stomach hurt.
0.95 	 This is a very low-grade film.
0.63 	 For example, the movie takes place in 'Doomsville.'
0.95 	 Note to all prospective home buyers: if the town you're moving to is called 'Doomsville,' keep moving.
1.0 	 Stephanie Beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen.
1.0 	 It's like the theme music for 'Chariots of Fire' goes Electronica.
0.71 	 I really feel for them because the work here is so well-intentioned.
0.99 	 Even the end credits are hilarious.
1.0 	 -- The boom is credited to 'Mr B.
0.96 	 Stick,' and the 3rd Unit's wardrobe (Yep, they had a third unit) is credited to K-mart.
0.53 	 The movie is very, very bad, but the goals of Stephanie Beaton, her friends and family are so well-intentioned in 'The Bagman' that you can't help but like the movie they've produced.
1.0 	 In its own sweet way, it even manages to be a bit endearing.
0.96 	 I guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly.<br /><br />Watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this.
0.93 	 Stick didn't do a very good job.
0.77 	 The special effects look to be where most of the money went.
1.0 	 They tend to be more funny than gruesome, although when the 'Bagman' is finally unmasked at the end, the make-up job there is surprisingly well done.<br /><br />My 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot.
1.0 	 This is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand.
0.97 	 Great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves B-movie or low budget film aficionados.
0.98 	 All others should probably avoid with great prejudice.
0.62 	 While it's early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be.
0.91 	 There is still potential for the series, however.
0.99 	 I liked the introduction.
1.0 	 The show's opening credits were interesting, with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song.
1.0 	 Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain.<br /><br />Where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the "feel" of setting out on a grand adventure.
1.0 	 Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that once again would make us THINK).
0.5 	 Make us feel the excitement of "the wind" and being on "the sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay.
0.94 	 New kids on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe.
0.84 	 That meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological.
0.96 	 Just how DO two such different societies interact?
0.97 	 Don't just hint about it, SHOW it!<br /><br />I had to think of it more as `Trek with an akward crew and limited technology' as opposed to `the first brave steps into the unknown'.
0.71 	 I wanted to see something newer and fresher.
1.0 	 The series promises to have a new concept but so far I haven't seen this new, great concept.<br /><br />I will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential.
0.98 	 There are some interesting characters.
1.0 	 Bakula is wonderful.
0.93 	 Blalock has potential.
1.0 	 The overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11.
1.0 	 If only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme, we will have a show which will create new legends.<br /><br />You shoot an arrow into the air... Good luck Capt.
0.7 	 Archer.<br /><br />To the producers: TAKE MORE RISKS AND MAKE US *THINK*!
0.51 	 :-)
0.88 	 In Japan, ballroom dancing is not approved of.
0.83 	 This movie seemed to have it all going for it with good camera, sound, film, sets, music, costumes ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch spoke!
0.8 	 Considering the casting of him in this role, I found it difficult to root for him even to the very end.
0.89 	 And to go to the extreme to kill her own son?
0.99 	 And to then push up her lover as succeeding King?
0.72 	 I read another user's comments about audio being dubbed, but don't think his was dubbed ... after all, he speaks English, right?
0.98 	 The scenery and filming crew along with very good quality film is what really made this movie above all else.
0.96 	 I'm not sure that I enjoyed this much.
0.92 	 Stick to the first "Vampires", it's a good movie.
0.98 	 Roy Rogers and company try to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful.
0.99 	 Andy Devine (as "Cookie") slapsticks around.
0.96 	 Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or, is that sing-in?)
0.99 	 Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers.
0.57 	 James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look of "Grand Canyon Trail".
0.98 	 A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance.
0.93 	 Mr. Devine's mule kicks its heels.
0.64 	 There are energetic human performances, too - but, the material isn't Grand.
0.97 	 A truly, truly dire Canadian-German co-production, the ever-wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few uears prior to the "action" the child murdered her father, and mum took the fall for the offspring.
0.84 	 Now she's moved up to the Northwest US to start over, but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother.
0.96 	 Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer don't really convince as mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both of whom are worthy of far more than this, and both of whom (particularly Rosanna) are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago.<br /><br />One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three-hour "Love, Lies And Murder" (from Two Short Productions) has there been such a "You must be joking" credit.
1.0 	 The story Â such as it is Â is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games.
0.95 	 Whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win $1,000,000.
0.76 	 I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions.
0.62 	 Still one of my favorite episodes.<br /><br />On a side-note, I'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character Okona was about to have a tryst(after Teri Hatcher's character) before being rudely interrupted by Lt Worf.
0.97 	 In a variant of Sholay , Ram Gopal Verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape.
1.0 	 The Thakur goes south.Mohanlal as Narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance Madrasi style.
1.0 	 Babban, the new avtar of gabbar is also different.
0.67 	 He is Bambaiya.
0.98 	 Gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued.
0.91 	 Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romances Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba.
1.0 	 he also dances and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who plays Jalal Agha in Mehbooba.Babban is more intelligent this time.
1.0 	 Viru was fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role.
0.73 	 The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful.
0.76 	 Jai was composed and serious.
0.87 	 Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him.
0.67 	 He is not as romantic as Jai with the mouth organ .
0.87 	 Jaya's role played by Sushmita changes careers.
0.65 	 A pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed.
0.99 	 Her flirtations with Jai are more open this time.
0.96 	 Samba gets a bigger role this time as Tambe.
0.72 	 He follows Babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den.
0.97 	 Horses give way to Jeeps and auto.
0.86 	 The Gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj.
1.0 	 RGV comes up with his own interpretation of the classic.
0.92 	 But we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues.
0.97 	 So Mr.RGV(Sholay ) and Farhan Akhtar (Don) and JPDutta(Umrao jaan) stop making remixes and start making originals.
1.0 	 This is not a bad movie.
0.92 	 They stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this.
0.98 	 I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag".<br /><br />I'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film.
0.89 	 As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can of my new religion's history.
0.92 	 We were to have had reservations at the Vistor's Center to view this movie.
0.71 	 Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing!
0.96 	 It's tragic, and you know she's going to end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do.
0.98 	 Totally empty.
0.95 	 The "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.<br /><br />It's a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema.
1.0 	 Even now I remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing on-end... <br /><br />I have seen some comments on the movie which say it's not this and not that...I think those people get scared by Friday 13th and the like, stalk and slash rammel, which are laughable.
0.91 	 This is a 'traditional' ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects...no swearing, no blood, no gratuitous sex scenes, no chainsaws or guns etc...So how refreshing!!!!
0.6 	 The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect....
0.98 	 I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story.
1.0 	 Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever!?
0.51 	 ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright... from the annoying characters in this movie.
0.69 	 Each character, in each scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply strange.
0.96 	 A young American woman visits her Irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her.
0.5 	 "Gespenster" (2005) forms, together with "Yella" (2007), and "Jerichow" (2008), the Gespenster-trilogy of director Christian Petzold, doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time.<br /><br />Roughly, "Gespenster" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever.
1.0 	 However, this time, when she meets Nina, everything comes quite different.<br /><br />The movie does not bring solutions, not even part-solutions, and insofar, it is rather disappointing.
0.7 	 We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not, if her actual daughter is still alive or not.
0.93 	 Most disappointing is the end.
0.78 	 The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed, can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex.
0.99 	 in "Umberto D."), but in "Gespenster", it is displaced.<br /><br />Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie, let me give my own attempt: Why is it that similar persons do not know one another, especially not the persons that another similar person knows?
0.94 	 This is quite an insane question, agreed, from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic, according to which the notion of the individual holds.
0.62 	 So, the Aristotelian answer to my question is: They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change.
0.77 	 Everybody who is not insane, believes that.
0.88 	 scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade?
0.87 	 This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made, although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that.
0.98 	 Recap: Full moon.
0.59 	 He is on the hunt for a girl.
0.65 	 The Girl.
0.98 	 This particular powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, is closing in on the girl.
0.95 	 A lot of scenes with semi-nude girls more or less important for the plot.
0.99 	 One usually turns to two main themes.
0.95 	 Check.
0.91 	 They're not very special though.
0.92 	 As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life.
1.0 	 This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull.
0.93 	 He crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something!
0.78 	 Very unrealistic.<br /><br />And secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA.
0.95 	 It was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick.
0.95 	 We were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod.
1.0 	 This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s, Jack Pearl (radio's "Baron Munchausen") as well as Jimmy Durante.
1.0 	 Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.<br /><br />As for the Stooges, this is a film from there very early days--before MGM had any idea what to do with the team.
0.81 	 At this point, they were known as "Ted Healy and his Stooges" as Healy was the front man.
0.61 	 Within a year, they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team.
0.96 	 This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and others).
0.99 	 In fact, up until they left for Columbia, MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles--including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY.
0.59 	 And, oddly, in this film they didn't act as a team--they just did various supporting roles, such as Larry playing the piano!<br /><br />This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle.
1.0 	 As for Pearl, I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films, as he has the personality of a slug (but slightly less welcome).
0.57 	 As for Durante, I never knew what the public saw in him--as least as far as his films are concerned--he was loud and...loud!
1.0 	 Together, Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor(?)
0.86 	 Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd.
0.83 	 What they did in the film was pretty good, but because all the segments were short, they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines.
0.85 	 At about the 13 minute mark, you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing.
0.98 	 Look carefully, as this is Walter Brennan in a role you'd certainly never expect!
0.61 	 This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called "Pre-Code" scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 (when the Production Code was strengthened).
0.98 	 Finally, at the 63 minute mark, see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades.
0.96 	 Tarzan and his mate(1934) was the only Tarzan movie I didn't see when I was a kid.
1.0 	 It sounded boring.
0.87 	 I have seen the ape man(1932) about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive.
0.93 	 Tarzan and his mate(1934) however, falters.
0.99 	 Big budget expensive.
0.54 	 She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead.
0.7 	 Well.
0.99 	 She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant.
0.73 	 The thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle.
0.89 	 Stupid?
0.67 	 Later someone founds it in the river.
0.99 	 Well it's supposed to proof Tarzan is dead.
0.94 	 Some cheap drama.
0.95 	 The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that he is gone.
0.92 	 Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is, how hard he is to kill.
0.75 	 The caravan is leaving and Jane go along.
0.9 	 Again a pothole.
0.68 	 Picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle Jane.
0.94 	 She could talk to the apes, and so on.
1.0 	 If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable.
1.0 	 And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with "I blame myself as much as you".
0.91 	 A punishment for being vane perhaps?
0.59 	 Nonsense.
0.55 	 Struggle, a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate.
0.56 	 Still.
0.97 	 This movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep.
0.59 	 Don't miss it just because you think its an old movie.
0.96 	 Do yourself a favour and don't.
0.99 	 This movie is pretty cheesy, but I do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles.
0.85 	 Sure it's not all that well done, but the premise is not at all bad.<br /><br />Tom
0.84 	 what can i say.
0.96 	 oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird.
0.96 	 they scare the heck out of me.
0.69 	 if you havent already seen it then what you waiting for an invitation.
0.8 	 Intergalactic criminal Kol (Ross Hagen) has been sentenced to death and awaits execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose.
0.72 	 But tonight there's going to be a jailbreak, and Kol flees on a conveniently-placed escape pod and flies towards Earth (which apparently is nearby).
0.81 	 But, as awful as it turned out to be, it was a ton of fun as well (probably at least partially because I was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome).
0.95 	 The director (Fred Olen Ray), who has specialized in making over one hundred low-grade films (most notably "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"), does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects.
0.91 	 Bonus: P.J.
0.94 	 What the heck is "Quadrant 5"?
0.84 	 And the Lund guy (Robert Clarke)... does his character even have a point?
0.85 	 Does the game he plays with the captain have a point?
0.86 	 But the biggest mystery is the android (or gynoid) the Alienator, played by Teagan Clive.
0.66 	 What is an "alienator"?
0.89 	 If you're going to make a female android, wouldn't the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in?
0.97 	 Mission not accomplished.
0.94 	 Maybe there's not much of a story and maybe the characters aren't really very interesting.
0.97 	 And maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason -- what use does a killer robot have with a deer?
0.85 	 But overall, I actually liked the movie.
1.0 	 I won't be pimping it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest DVD copy (which I'm sure is just packed with amazing special features -- not).
0.87 	 But I consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future.
0.98 	 We should all congratulate Uwe Boll.
0.69 	 I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy.
1.0 	 I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games.
0.98 	 Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play.
0.65 	 There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it.
0.99 	 Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning.
0.94 	 What's next, Silent Hill?
0.61 	 The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll.
0.72 	 Never underestimate Uwe's ability to turn out a big, steaming pile of BOLL sh*t.
0.99 	 My friends and I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best.
0.83 	 For some ideas on the answer to those questions, read Prey by the well-know oil-stooge Michael Crichton... oh wait, he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies.
0.84 	 Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish.
0.92 	 When I rented this movie I thought I was going to see a horror-movie.
0.92 	 The situation is bleak enough.
0.88 	 We can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap.
0.57 	 But this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension.
0.77 	 She cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later.
0.92 	 Bad enough.
0.92 	 The Isareli army sends a commando to Nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street.
0.76 	 The husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack.
0.9 	 We thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the Prince of Verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the Prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of Israel.
0.98 	 The game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides.
0.69 	 What comes out of the film is that over there in Tel Aviv or Nablus love is impossible.
0.98 	 The film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in Palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on.
1.0 	 Today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated.
0.99 	 But so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations.
0.76 	 So suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers.
0.6 	 it's quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it's not didactic.
0.95 	 An opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a midget), prostitutes galore, a violent fracas in a dive, a motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot, a boozer falling down the stairs, a racially mixed clientÃ¨le in a bar with Asians, Africans, and Anglos treated equally, does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall?
0.72 	 Wrong.
0.81 	 His producers take him to see a popular talky of the day, John Wayne in "The Big Trail."
0.63 	 Kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business.
0.74 	 Could be.
0.81 	 How Berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated.
0.98 	 Now, a number of years later, the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video.
0.59 	 The plan is for Michael to get off a technicality, and run off into the sun with Elsa.
0.58 	 They are hateful, not romantic, lovers in this, so it's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen.
0.6 	 Indeed, Welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well.<br /><br />Everett Sloane is suitably slimy as Hayworth's crippled husband.
0.54 	 It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why does he invite a 'threat' on board?
0.95 	 )and Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes.<br /><br />This is a jumbled, convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed.
0.78 	 It's a pity (only a slight one , as Rita was a brilliant dancer) that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 40's instead of darkly-themed noir like this.
0.83 	 He was harassed, and picked on in high school.
1.0 	 A group of kids played several pranks on him, and these pranks were REALLY bad.
0.96 	 The last prank ended tragically.<br /><br />cue to 5 years later.
0.94 	 The school is now abandoned, and they have to break in.
0.72 	 We see a figure in a jester mask, hunting them one by one throughout the school.
0.94 	 After the first person is killed, they find out they are locked in the school.
0.99 	 They begin looking for a way out.<br /><br />Now, there are a number of illogical things in this movie.
0.57 	 Second of all, after the first kid dies, a girl gets blood all over her.
0.92 	 They all run away in a panic, yet she runs to the bathroom, and finds a bathtub.
0.58 	 Hrr friend has just been killed, and she decides to take a bath!?
0.75 	 More importantly, why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom.
1.0 	 Anyways, the bathtub doesn't seem to really work....and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie.
0.89 	 it is a horror slasher.
0.99 	 WHO CARES if it has some illogical parts.
0.97 	 I for one don't.
1.0 	 My God, what an incredible movie it is!
1.0 	 There were audible groans in the cinema during the above-mentioned scene in Pearl Harbour (no kidding either) The Lost Battalion however is really in a class of its own 
.<br /><br />"Americans think they are unbeatable
inspired bravery
. "
0.82 	 The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote those other screamers
Hamburger Hill, No Mercy , Heartbreak Ridge.
0.78 	 Someone, please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage.<br /><br />The Director, Russell Mulcahy is an Australian too.
0.51 	 !
0.71 	 Hmmmm....<br /><br />Anyway, the protector (who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favour of local clothing) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future-born hero-to-be.
0.89 	 At some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Perhaps, in an exciting finale, he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of... acid.
0.98 	 He will then re-emerge, as strong as ever.
0.93 	 <br /><br />The costumes and effects are great in this movie...
0.6 	 I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: Next Generation too!
1.0 	 Sean Young does another great turn as an unemotive Replicant, and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young's Fat Cop Boyfriend.
0.62 	 One word: suPURRRRb!
0.83 	 I don't think I have see anything like this in a long time on network or cable television.
0.75 	 Watching this show was like taking a breath of fresh air amid TV schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs.
0.98 	 After all, critics were almost unanimous in crying foul and downgrading the show.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Script was funny, with a lot of inside and adult jokes which were sharp, yet not tacky.
0.8 	 A note for all parents: this is NOT for children.
1.0 	 So if you'd like to complain about "objectionable context", save your breath.
0.58 	 Putting the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach.
0.74 	 Hopefully, the rest of the show is not going to play the same old record over and over.
0.81 	 Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken as a crazed homeless man CAN'T make me laugh?
0.5 	 The.
0.93 	 Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh, right?
0.99 	 It is a shame American films can't be as open an honoust as this one.
0.86 	 I Rate this film 81%.
0.65 	 Twenty years ago, the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later.
1.0 	 On the present days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm.
0.99 	 He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever.
0.81 	 Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies.
0.99 	 In the very end, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story.
0.94 	 I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time.
0.94 	 The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie.
0.99 	 My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
0.95 	 This "Debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am speechless" I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work.
0.96 	 I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make fun of this movie" but this movie is giving me nothing to work with.
0.65 	 OH!
0.61 	 I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen.
0.92 	 Christmas is coming.
0.89 	 Buy this movie and give it to people you hate.
0.51 	 -Mike
0.66 	 people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production.
0.56 	 Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making.
0.72 	 In French with English subtitles.
1.0 	 As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit.
1.0 	 You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching, this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get!
0.91 	 In the next scene Roddy has caught it again.
1.0 	 Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options!
0.69 	 And to top it all off someone commented on how much they LIKED it.
1.0 	 To them all I have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof fury starring Bruce Lee.
0.97 	 What is this world coming to.
0.85 	 **** SPOILER WARNING ****<br /><br />Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen.
0.94 	 It would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it.
0.63 	 During the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and company, who often did take-offs on films, skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine.
1.0 	 Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked Ryan O'Neal.
0.88 	 Jenny really looks like she's dying alright...dying for her make-up artist to come in and give her a little color.
0.8 	 And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient's final moments.
0.99 	 The ending scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic.
0.88 	 He had plenty to worry about.
0.86 	 With no intent on following through, Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise.
0.51 	 He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.<br /><br />As fate would dictate, Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy.
0.93 	 Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be.
0.86 	 The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's tight directorial style and Morris Chestnut's rapid fire editing.
0.65 	 "The Mother" is a weird low-budget movie, touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema: denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age.<br /><br />The characters are awful: May is a disgusting old lady and I believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her.
0.98 	 She is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter delusions.
0.58 	 Her brother Bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists in having her shop, a terrible business indeed.
1.0 	 Okay, so the plot is on shaky ground.
1.0 	 (He needs to, because she seems to have a... problem with emoting.)
0.59 	 It just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real *talent*.<br /><br />Not on the 'classics' level with 'Singin' In The Rain', but pretty high up there nonetheless.
1.0 	 My kids picked this out at the video store...it's great to hear Liza as Dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom.
1.0 	 First of all, I too was expecting another Hero--a fantastic work of art for the action genre.
0.99 	 I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD.<br /><br />Basic elements from Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, mesmerizing cinematography, and sincere acting (I mean, if you can't understand a word they are saying, without the subtitles, but you still care--that's good acting)<br /><br />What went wrong?
0.99 	 What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story.
0.99 	 Worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle.
0.92 	 You have three characters who, I guess, fall in love with each other- for no good reasons.
0.62 	 The remainder of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind."
0.94 	 Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces.
0.94 	 The husband-and-wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films.
0.8 	 As is the case for some other performers of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them, in which they're portrayed by other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me', starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker.<br /><br />In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- Jesse Block and Eve Sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the "second-team" Fields and Seeley.
0.99 	 Offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples' living arrangements.
0.99 	 Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending in comfortable retirement.<br /><br />The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists.
0.74 	 Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930, although I've never heard of them.
0.98 	 When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive.<br /><br />I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act.
0.94 	 Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals.
0.57 	 My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully.
0.7 	 The interplay between the characters is a moral disaster.
0.77 	 I rented this shortly after renting Ben Stein's "Expelled" and thought it would interesting to compare them.
1.0 	 I'm trying to be objective, for the record.<br /><br />I tend to enjoy Maher's HBO show now and then, though I rarely think he's the source of the humor.
0.98 	 As for my religious views, I'll say for simplicity's sake that I'm a non-denom.
1.0 	 He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds.
0.98 	 He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education.
0.97 	 (it's in the bonus features where he's standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think.)
0.82 	 How difficult is that?
0.54 	 Wow, so people in cults think outside of the norm?
0.92 	 How enlightening to know this.
0.99 	 Great work Maher!
0.89 	 Again, it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of "patriotic duty" that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in.<br /><br />Beyond all that, he's just not that funny here.
0.77 	 Some of the clips that are overlaid in "clever" out of context/irreverent ways might garner a laugh, but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming, much less convincing.
0.67 	 I stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater, their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes -- eyes wandering at their neighbor, wondering if it was just them.
0.72 	 It can't be the look in "his" eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that.
0.75 	 In the old Supermans, she had some level of connection with him, he wasn't priority number 1, obviously, but it strengthened her character that she was "torn".
1.0 	 person.<br /><br />SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his earth dad, then finds his real super dad, the story is captivating every step of the way.
1.0 	 He's human, he relates to people and he feels love for people, he relates to highschool students, he relates to people who feel different.
0.55 	 He relates.
0.98 	 The Superman Returns superman seems to relate only to Superpeople and it seems he's just "doing a job" when he's saving people.<br /><br />There's something about Clark that Lois likes, she's really internally in love with him but can't admit it, and when he comes into the picture as Superman, it throws a kink in the on-the-rocks love.
0.99 	 Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a pile of horse maneur to Lois.
0.97 	 Literally.<br /><br />SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again.
0.99 	 As a kid, I "thought" I enjoyed the action, but now I know it was the STORY that held me then too, watching it over and over again.
0.76 	 If I saw Superman Returns as a child, I would've hated it then too, I think.<br /><br />There is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie, it's sick.
1.0 	 Superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile, MEANWHILE, Lex Luther's got something fantastic up his sleeve.<br /><br />SUPERMAN THREE Now there's a three-way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins and Clark's inner nature beats Superman's power, because when his SUPERmoral nature is gone and he's SuperHUMAN (who does human things with his superpowers), she sees it's not the power of Superman that she's in love with, it's not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman that she loves -- and who's really SUPER.
1.0 	 And when she tells Clark she "prefers" him to Superman, he is elated, he has made a human connection again.
0.71 	 He wants to be accepted for who he is, not just for his ability to bend steel.
0.95 	 THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT'S MISSING FROM SUPERMAN RETURNS.<br /><br />Clark super-sneezes to help the kid get a strike - humanity again.
0.93 	 Plus, it's an INERESTING use of superpowers.
0.84 	 He's not just using straight brute strength.<br /><br />He crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers, love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving.<br /><br />It seems there's nothing at stake in Superman Returns.
0.87 	 In the second one, he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more POWERFUL than, but combined with Lex's genius, and the villains' immoral tactics, Superman's overpowering wasn't enough, he had to work one against the other and outsmart them...
0.7 	 He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw.
0.81 	 He doesn't need to figure anything out, he just uses his "super strength".
0.73 	 FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!)
0.68 	 One hour later, after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system.
0.56 	 Bah!
0.96 	 Firstly, it is a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombi 2, with Zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi.
0.93 	 Confusing enough?
0.98 	 Basically, none of the films have anything to do with one another, but who cares when they make money.
0.98 	 I guess Fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through Zombi 3 when he decided to walk out.
0.97 	 Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok.
0.63 	 The scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice.
0.99 	 The film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution, corrupted military, Man playing God, etc.
0.86 	 I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when Mattei came on board.<br /><br />Besides ripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of Romero's The Crazies.
0.81 	 Zombie Birth 2.
0.97 	 Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool.
0.97 	 He was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.<br /><br />Favorite Quote Â When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie, the scientists asks, "Don't you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground, and contaminate everything?"
1.0 	 The show had great episodes, this is not one of them.
0.77 	 ", "All through the house", and "Dig that cat, he's real gone.
0.92 	 "<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen).
0.81 	 Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
0.77 	 An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus.
0.99 	 The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes.
0.82 	 After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies.
0.55 	 The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good.
1.0 	 Patiently i waited for it's DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing.
0.87 	 The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests.
0.99 	 The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along.
0.59 	 The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD.
0.56 	 However, this movie is so all-around wonderful, it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general IMDb voter.
0.99 	 However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and "Paulie" doesn't qualify for that.<br /><br />The only acting criticism I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child.
0.92 	 What's not to like?
0.85 	 That's normal for him, it seems.
0.76 	 I don't like mangoes, but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one.
0.83 	 The car's air-conditioning died, half the restaurants had dead cooling (as did our hotel) and I said, "let's watch a movie where there is working air-conditioning."
0.95 	 So we did.
0.74 	 So for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused, and given a heart-warming experience.
0.85 	 His dream sounds like a little kid's bedtime story.
0.75 	 The End.
0.97 	 The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one.
0.87 	 It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence.
0.88 	 Still, she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life; there's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve, and it primes her vulnerability.
0.91 	 When a patient, Billy Hahn (Steven Goldstein), confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers, and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay, she decides to intervene on his behalf.
0.97 	 This takes her to the `House of Games,' a seedy little dive where she meets Mike (Joe Mantegna), a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world.
0.64 	 And Mike agrees to wipe the slate clean, if she'll agree to do him one simple favor, which involves a card game he has going on in the back room.
0.98 	 And nothing is what it seems.
0.97 	 She changes; and whether or not it's for the better is open to speculation.
0.51 	 You'll find it under `Perfection.'
0.76 	 I rate this one 10/10.
0.51 	 A treat for both the eye and the ear.
0.99 	 Sometime in 1998, Saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand-new Ninja Turtles live-action series.
0.98 	 Naturally, being a fan of the TMNT back in the day, this obviously peaked my interest.
0.85 	 Some time later (more like recently), I got a chance to revisit the series.<br /><br />First off, let's talk about some of the positives.
0.83 	 They managed to re-create the Turtles' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this.
0.99 	 There tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot.
0.99 	 And the Turtle suits, while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series.<br /><br />People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a Power Rangers show.
0.61 	 So on a personal standpoint, I was sort of glad they got rid of Shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode.
1.0 	 I find that Shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they end up replacing him with these original villains who, as stated, seemed more fit for a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show.
0.69 	 And with these new magic-wielding generics comes a new female magic-wielding turtle, the infamous Venus De Milo.
0.92 	 I'll be honest; I never got comfortable with her.
0.93 	 I almost get the impression that this could have easily been the Venus De Milo show dealing with her make-believe enemies and the TMNT are just there to provide the star power (or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released).
0.88 	 Fortunately, they all share the spotlight together.<br /><br />Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it.
0.96 	 Given time and maybe another season, I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness.
1.0 	 As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten.
0.71 	 Most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama!
1.0 	 There are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all.
0.98 	 It is true, the movie drags slightly, with the antics of the mice, but they were genuinely funny, so I don't care.
1.0 	 It rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel does on Cinemagic on a regular basis.
0.52 	 This film was hard to get a hold of, and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming.
0.82 	 While Williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the D.B.
0.99 	 Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off.
0.93 	 Following an incident one meal-time, he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour.
0.98 	 OK, first a correction to the tag posted on this movie's main page.
0.73 	 Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie, nor did he stop at his sister's grave.
0.93 	 Some say that Ann was, in fact, Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it.<br /><br />Now, there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this film.
0.76 	 She also sings "But Where Are You?"
1.0 	 Luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance.
0.92 	 It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact.
0.84 	 "The Return of Chandu" is notable, if one can say that, for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain.
0.53 	 Why he even gets the girl.<br /><br /> The story as such, involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delectable Maria Alba) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like Nadji.
0.92 	 Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to thwart the villains.<br /><br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage.
0.99 	 Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes.
0.54 	 The less said about the others the better.<br /><br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career, because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time.
0.86 	 Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl, who knows.
0.95 	 The "gangster" genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody.
0.86 	 In retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichÃ©s that have been utilized in it's genre, thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it.
0.98 	 All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series, but I won't.
0.77 	 The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend it's not funny.
0.76 	 Both men seem to break out of their daily lives.<br /><br />The end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left.
0.91 	 It's never too late to change.
0.97 	 But the movie is just so much better.
0.93 	 But, I missed a few.
0.79 	 But count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks
1.0 	 <br /><br />This is gentle spy story hour, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre.<br /><br />Give me Smiley any day.
0.97 	 The cinematography was acceptable.
0.82 	 And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie.
0.6 	 Anyway, Black Mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either.
0.92 	 But the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing.
0.87 	 (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.
0.86 	 Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good.
0.97 	 I have seen this film at least six times, being the first time in the 70's, in the movie theater.
0.91 	 The creepy and lurid story frightens even in the present days.
0.8 	 Fans of horror movie certainly worships 'The Sentinel', and I am one of them.
0.61 	 : On 02 September 2007, I saw this movie again.
0.73 	 However, Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced.
1.0 	 I'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series.
0.93 	 There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it!
0.97 	 Many films just seem like re-treads of old ideas, so that is the big reason I so strongly recommend Passport to Pimlico.<br /><br />The movie is set just after WW2 and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to be driving Londoners "barmy".
0.95 	 They, too, are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it.
0.94 	 I am always amazed when I see the sort of generally high rating a movie like this gets and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged by his work.
0.54 	 After I get done laughting at humanity I weep.
0.86 	 The website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book.
0.96 	 It was going to be a "perfect translation".
0.79 	 It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90's PC or Playstation CD-Rom video game.
0.71 	 Sadly enough, the color quality was similar.
0.92 	 The acting made Shatners classic "dramatic pause" look damn near Shakespearean in quality.
0.98 	 The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental's.
0.85 	 Simply changing the color around the people to purple, blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME.
0.56 	 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects.
0.89 	 The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks, if you want "The War of the Worlds", do one of four things.
0.99 	 1) Watch the 1953 original, 2) watch the early 90's TV series, 3) wait for Spielberg's rendition to be released shortly, OR 4) Read the frikkin book (something we all probably did in elementary English class).
0.58 	 AVOID THIS MOVIE.
0.85 	 IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY.
0.61 	 It was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice.
1.0 	 John Ritter, whom Knotts worked with in "Three's Company," was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like "The Dreamer of Oz," but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in "Pleasantville."
0.81 	 and "Police Squad.
0.99 	 It's especially evident in the "exterior" scenes of the "town" where Roy goes after he's fired.
0.73 	 How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus?
0.89 	 Movies, even kid's movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades.
0.97 	 Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written.
0.87 	 Disney's "The Love Bug," for instance, at least had some interesting race action.
0.91 	 And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult.
0.57 	 One again the writers have done it!
0.99 	 The acting is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are handsome, so if you're looking for well-acted soft porn, this movie is for you.
0.97 	 The motivation of the main characters, in particular the eponymous lead, is often a mystery.
0.67 	 Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter?
0.92 	 Conversely, her lover, who starts off as a narcissistic jerk, becomes a selfless hero during the trial.
1.0 	 At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love.
0.8 	 Naturally, since no good deed must go unpunished, we are told that she never sees him again.
0.76 	 And will admit that I shed quite a few tears throughout.<br /><br />On the whole, not a movie that I would seek out to what, however I am sure glad I did see it.
0.92 	 This is the 2nd time I've seen this movie in about 12 years.
1.0 	 These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be amazing, worthy films.
0.58 	 I couldn't tell you what he was exploring here.
0.54 	 It's all as mannered as Welle's godawful Irish brogue; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the film.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Kudos to Welles though, for having Hayworth cut her hair, and getting that performance out of her.
1.0 	 The camera loves her.
1.0 	 She's the classiest, most upscale, sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film.
0.57 	 But her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision, made so the movie will have some genre it fits into.
1.0 	 ; to convince you you've seen something thoughtful?
0.5 	 to give Welles more to do?
0.87 	 to make you roll your eyes?
1.0 	 Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources.
0.91 	 This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others.
0.98 	 It is worth watching to understand the fact that Movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray.
0.68 	 Still, there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a Dam.
0.79 	 The story centers on the Captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company.
1.0 	 I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the Genre were interesting to me.
0.79 	 When it's time for "Panic" to moves, it does - quickly.<br /><br />"Panic" doesn't seem panicked at all.
1.0 	 But it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate, mirroring Alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog.
1.0 	 I've always been of the opinion that the Batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful Batman live action film sequels.
0.9 	 That's one of the reason's many of her films are OOP.
0.94 	 She gives a good performance in this movie.
0.96 	 Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny.
0.69 	 The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity.
0.84 	 If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.
0.95 	 A patchwork about 911.
0.69 	 Don`t go there, what ever you do, don`t.
0.96 	 Maybe it was based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was as well released only DVD almost everywhere, had major screenings in Russia and grossed more than 1mln$.
0.77 	 Even if it has Jessica Simpson.
0.98 	 The original Thunderbirds earned a place in TV history.
1.0 	 The Thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward - the very essence of heroism and selflessness.
0.96 	 There was little physical violence.
0.99 	 The Thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree - how many of us would dream of someday building a Thunderbird 2?
0.94 	 Much of the action consists of Kung Fu/Power Rangers type fighting.
0.78 	 Then there was a dose of "Use the Force Luke" mysticism thrown in when TinTin would levitate something or another, coupled with the The Hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".
0.59 	 About the only thing missing was for The Hood to go "TinTin, I am your Uncle" with a breath mask voice.
1.0 	 The heart that made Thunderbirds unique was GONE.<br /><br />The only bright point was Ron Cook's portrayal of Parker - he caught it perfectly.
0.87 	 But the actress playing Lady Penelope came across as a child - HUH????
0.73 	 OK, so if they were making a kids' movie - fine - next time distribute it straight to video, where many of these belong.
1.0 	 The only thing worthwhile is the top-notch Lalo Schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting.
0.53 	 Yay!...
0.91 	 It's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion.
0.56 	 They have no emotion!
0.88 	 I have seen this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, I was on the brink of turning off the TV, despite it being MST 3K.<br /><br />Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
0.95 	 Something that curiously, in all the previous comments, no one has pointed out , but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie <br /><br />the Turkish Baths sequence: a back street at night, the entrance of a sleazy sauna, and Scalise wrapped in a sheet, getting his thighs massaged.
0.85 	 type , and another guy, a bodyguard?
0.87 	 finishes dressing up.
0.91 	 Why is it that he hates them so much ?
0.86 	 <br /><br />Could it be that he hates himself.
0.99 	 That dark side that could lead him right at the end of the sidewalk, into the gutter ?
0.63 	 What if that dark side lurked within a "closet" ?
0.83 	 Remember : whenever Dixon meets Scalise ( 3 times), the guy is lying on a bed, and he only has men around him for company ( the irony of the " Girls" poster pinned up on the wall near his bed !
0.5 	 ).<br /><br />Scalise acts funny: affected manners, cranking his neck arrogantly, defiant, shoving his inhalator ( poppers ?)
0.7 	 Dixon, with a vengeance, is bent on pinning down Scalise who seems not to understand : "I never saw a man so full of hate as you.
0.83 	 Why?
0.87 	 Scalise : "I warn you not to touch me! "
0.86 	 Dixon's homophobia is obvious.
0.93 	 In reaction to this, he decided to become a cop, a good one, but there is something of the criminal in him, a dark side: he is a violent copper, a murderer, a liar.
1.0 	 The waitress scoffing says that he doesn't know how to make love to a woman.
0.95 	 And why very little reference to the original show and characters?
0.58 	 It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why couldn't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars?
0.94 	 It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better.
0.99 	 Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again.
0.63 	 I've never laughed and giggled so much in my life!
0.67 	 The first half kept me in stitches; the last half made me come completely unglued!
0.98 	 And though he talks fast, you catch every joke.
0.77 	 Which is probably why my "laugh center" was so overwhelmed; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything.<br /><br />
0.98 	 Mediocre at absolute best.
0.75 	 I seems though that every time one type of movie is released, a second must be around the same time.
0.55 	 A series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage.<br /><br />I really don't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
0.99 	 It's interesting to see what shape Pierce Brosnan's career was in before Bond arrived on the scene.
1.0 	 In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick, who works leading ghetto kids on "confidence courses".
0.83 	 He romances a woman, who has a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s kid called Eric.
0.98 	 The husband enters.
0.61 	 Pierce resumes making vegeburgers.
0.89 	 The husband then assaults Pierce.
0.96 	 This is as good as the film gets.<br /><br />
0.66 	 I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered, and lo and behold he came home w/the script.
0.92 	 That's the good stuff.
0.56 	 The acting...fair.
0.7 	 Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina.
0.85 	 But not as dramatic.
0.8 	 I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it.
0.51 	 It's a good example of why I watch so little network TV.
0.98 	 once they reached the "land of milk and honey", why didn't they just stay there?
0.89 	 Would you endanger your life, and that of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle?
0.89 	 Risk death for a cow??
0.83 	 Better them than I!
0.85 	 If you are thinking of building see this movie first.
0.96 	 The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same.
0.94 	 Though the plot is very weak, I think the satirical humor more than makes up for it.
0.73 	 I can't think of any movie that has "grown on me" after an inauspicious first impression, as much as Cowgirls has.
0.85 	 - Ellen, the lost quote.<br /><br />"Kissing, Like, On the, Like, Mouth And Stuff" is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made.
0.78 	 But before I like begin like breaking new U.S.-20-something-airhead records with the my "likes", let me like just briefly list like the high- like -lights of this visual like feast: <br /><br />1.
1.0 	 And not just that: the way the camera (guided so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen shot of Chris's fat white-trash stomach after he finishes the un-Catholic deed - that was truly thrilling.
0.98 	 I can in all honesty say that I've never seen such grace.
1.0 	 Chris, you should do more such scenes in your next movies, because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95", started.
1.0 	 Such elegance, such style.
0.98 	 No less than total, divine inspiration went into filming that sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy.
0.55 	 Ellen's hairy, thick arms.
0.93 	 Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername, cast themselves on purpose, because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender-based confusion.
0.97 	 Brilliant.
0.97 	 Brilliant - especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes: so utterly original and mind-blowing.
0.91 	 Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex Patrick wants to talk - like a girl.
0.64 	 Spiffing.<br /><br />4.
1.0 	 "He must love 'The Simpsons', which is quite Leftist."
0.9 	 I am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent Leftists.
1.0 	 Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change.
1.0 	 The number of "likes" that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal (3,849, to be exact).
0.5 	 The close-ups of toes.
1.0 	 Plenty of stuff here for foot-fetishists, which I think is a very liberal, highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities.
0.94 	 After all, shoe- and foot- fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone out there CARES.<br /><br />KOTM, or rather, KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye.
1.0 	 It isn't the worst film ever made, the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept.
0.61 	 Boogie Nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry.
1.0 	 For a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in Texas, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show."
0.99 	 I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny.
0.95 	 (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's 'Sunday Post' comics page.)
1.0 	 In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him.
0.57 	 I'll give Chase credit that his very best films -- such as 'Mighty Like a Moose' and 'His Wooden Wedding' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but I'm positive that even the most die-hard Chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude 'Married to Order' just isn't funny at all.<br /><br />Chase -- eager, awkward, gormless, naff -- is a young swain hoping to court the fair Rose.
1.0 	 Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who disdains Chase as a 'mollycoddle'.
1.0 	 Leo White, who did more notable work as a foil for Chaplin at Essanay, is on hand here as a rival.<br /><br />There's some action involving an Ingersoll watch.
0.99 	 I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product-placement?
0.71 	 Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but was never a believable ingenue.
0.95 	 It's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz.
0.55 	 For my part, if I could travel through time, it would be back to the 1950's when I grew up.
1.0 	 Maybe to a place like Willoughby, but that's another episode.<br /><br />One thing that wouldn't be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of "The Twilight Zone".
0.51 	 It's a real treat to watch any episode of "The Twilight Zone" and get to see who pops up from days gone by.
0.75 	 Very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check.
0.97 	 Mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something good vigilante style - check.
0.98 	 A sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check.
0.98 	 Cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods - check.
0.54 	 using childhood abuse as the reason for everything - check.
0.93 	 A child spree killer that is very, very non-menacing - check.
0.97 	 Foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion - check.
0.86 	 I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience, were vastly disappointed.
0.98 	 I'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun.
0.67 	 I couldn't help smiling after every episode I watched.
0.7 	 Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
0.83 	 The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume.
1.0 	 Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small.
0.77 	 Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they're a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set.
1.0 	 These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission.
1.0 	 The responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the most junior crew member.
0.82 	 I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer.
0.65 	 An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington did would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed, then drummed from the Navy.
0.97 	 Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection.
0.93 	 I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway.
0.83 	 Why?
0.85 	 Why don't people believe her?
0.95 	 I thought this movie was LOL funny.
0.95 	 And so the hijinx begin!
0.59 	 Wow!
0.68 	 I mean, the actors, the story, the pictures, the efx - everything was where it should be.
0.52 	 <br /><br />And a Danish EFX house producing those VFX - Wow!
0.78 	 *END OF SPOILER*<br /><br />But anyway, this is a Danish movie which I as a Dane can be proud of.<br /><br />The only "bad" about this, is that it wasn't a Danish director, but a Swedish...
0.97 	 I laughed myself sick the first three times I watched it.
0.67 	 I recommend it to everyone, with the warning that if they can't handle the f-sharps to stay FAR away.
0.51 	 Losing Control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world.
0.95 	 This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make-believe world.<br /><br />Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering a bout of writer's block.
0.7 	 she meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters.
0.99 	 Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales.
0.51 	 As in most films of this type, the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up.
0.84 	 They are so undemanding.<br /><br />Performances of the cast vary.
0.92 	 Doug Jeffery carries the film as the psycho/sociopath you do not want to cross.
0.83 	 4 stars.
0.62 	 First one has to take into account the time period this film was made in.
0.84 	 Rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it.<br /><br />Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by Nazis.
1.0 	 He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it.<br /><br />Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped.
0.87 	 So what?
0.95 	 Remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him.
0.56 	 They both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much.
0.99 	 They were angry like the Nazis but not on the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness.
0.98 	 Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis?
0.88 	 Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life.
0.82 	 Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just misguided.<br /><br />Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate.
0.74 	 Although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger.
0.98 	 I've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so I began to wonder if I'd imagined its whole existence.
0.81 	 But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it.
1.0 	 This morning when I threw the coins I received #29 The Abysmal (Water).
0.89 	 Well today I could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say.
0.93 	 I advise you to have a caffeine-propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple Gore-effects.Why they bring Alcatraz in?In this case,becomes increasingly difficult to swallow.
0.51 	 !
0.97 	 The convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time.
0.8 	 The movie was mildly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening.
0.82 	 Amazing that this film was even released!
0.65 	 With other crime movies being so dramatic I find, this movie is a shock to the system.
0.97 	 I simply never tire of watching FREEBIRD.
0.59 	 My husband was an extra so I was involved from the start.
0.75 	 Only Phil Daniels could fit the role of Grouch.
0.99 	 Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series.<br /><br />There's no escaping facts.
0.88 	 How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi TV series.<br /><br />Stargate SG-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly.
0.86 	 I follow perhaps one or two TV series at most and I hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when I found myself caught.<br /><br />So for those who decide to brush of Stargate SG-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show, don't.
0.71 	 Well it's been a long year and I'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004.
1.0 	 The acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic.
0.99 	 With barely a few key words to remember it by, i traced the film here, and much information, including the fact it's about to become an off-Broadway musical !<br /><br />Interestingly, unlike the previous comment maker, i do not remember finding this film sad, or exploitative.
1.0 	 In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'.
0.75 	 It is she who will have the last laugh maybe..(They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O' )
0.9 	 Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he's fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her, but he's willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesn't want to go to Mexico.
0.7 	 Right.
0.94 	 Talk above over-permissive parenting.
0.66 	 Third, when Pablo's employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is remarkably unprofessional, especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive?
0.6 	 CCH Pounder's Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her.<br /><br />To be fair, I'd like to list the things I liked.
0.79 	 Um, I liked the midget.
0.53 	 And I liked the fact that the midget was named Sexy.
1.0 	 But my favorite moment in the film has to be when Cristina kicks Detective Not-So-Bright.
0.97 	 I also find it interesting that, in a heavily minority cast (which I much appreciate, by the way), the black character is the racist one.
1.0 	 (She's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen, the kindest he had ever met.
0.97 	 )<br /><br />The police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out-of-place feeling of a French farce.
0.62 	 Most boring foot chases ever - Bright and Lightning are so out-of-shape and easily-fooled (he certainly isn't quick as lightning, and she, well, I don't feel the need to spell things out).
0.99 	 Would we ever see this on 'Cops '?<br /><br />Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: as an employer, would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk?<br /><br />Plus several scenes, including the above, threaten to devolve into porn: 'Well, I'll do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me...' I can almost hear the bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm.<br /><br />When the parents view the footage shot of Pablo's remorse, the grieving mom's freak-out is the most real the movie feels.
0.96 	 Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic.
0.69 	 Character development?
0.92 	 Tch.
0.98 	 (She's cared _so_much_ about her integrity thus far.)
0.89 	 What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him?<br /><br />Finally, Cristina's childlike acceptance of her mother's death giving Dr. Knight peace over his daughter's death - so forced.
0.98 	 I'm not saying there aren't generous, loving people who would do that.
0.55 	 I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.<br /><br />Co-writer, co-director, co-star Nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production.
0.97 	 Tune in and see.<br /><br />This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films, back in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote (he did both for this film).
0.93 	 So, while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director--even with its rather formulaic ending.<br /><br />Overall, while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly, the film works well.
0.51 	 Ooooof!
0.95 	 Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley.
0.97 	 I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s.
1.0 	 Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
0.76 	 Anybody want to place bets?
0.98 	 He spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds Donna celebrating her high school prom.
0.94 	 Apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please.
0.91 	 I miss Jamie Lee.
0.75 	 Instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college.
0.93 	 Was it her constant dreams, and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee?
0.64 	 You win the pot.<br /><br />-Finally, the movie is over.
0.81 	 Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere.
0.97 	 Australia is not immune to it.<br /><br />A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having "killed" her own baby.
0.76 	 to give me a present).
1.0 	 Shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead, Lori and her husband Frank move to the quiet little town of Lillith, where Frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory.
0.98 	 Lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity, especially with the town's patriarch and "owner" Mr. Cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious.
0.53 	 How can anybody "own" a town and everybody in it?
0.9 	 Either way, Lori gradually discovers that everybody in Lillith is a witch and Mr. Cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead.
0.96 	 Since many years already, Cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he's prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes.
0.89 	 "Necromancy" definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments, but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget.
0.94 	 The grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy.
0.89 	 Orson Welles' performance Â undoubtedly the low point of his career Â is pitiable, and still it's the best aspect about the entire movie.
0.86 	 This is where the dream part starts.<br /><br />The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right?
0.98 	 Cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 weirdos and Jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her).
0.88 	 The souls continue doing what they were defined as: Annie the rave-going chick, the 2 weirdo-killers (from opening scene), Father Jude still helping people etc.<br /><br />We are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images (many of which my GF and I still can't tie in) but it all boils down to it not being Cassie's time to die.<br /><br />At the end, Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while.
0.98 	 Her family and Sean are there.
0.84 	 This is reality again.
0.99 	 i should love this movie .
1.0 	 Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family .
0.99 	 i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it.again the acting was very very good and worth watching .
0.96 	 just a personal preference .thank you
0.7 	 If it had been properly done, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story.<br /><br />(3) With the book, I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
1.0 	 The director (Ondi Timoner) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film.
0.9 	 While it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of Elinore Stewart's children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good, enriching, strengthening experiences of homesteading her land.
1.0 	 The book details her life on her and her husband's adjoining homesteads in the vast Wyoming frontier; she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart.
0.58 	 That's not what this is about.
0.95 	 On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism.
1.0 	 So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before MI:2, expectations were rising.
0.95 	 Big cars.
0.94 	 Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar- Angelina Jolie.
0.93 	 A lot.
0.61 	 <br /><br />The script is neither funny (which it tries really hard to be) nor exciting.
0.67 	 you've got comedy?
0.98 	 Is this excitement?
1.0 	 Then comes the best bit- the romance between Nic and Angelina.
0.69 	 'Do you have a girlfriend?'
0.98 	 etc.<br /><br />Then there's only one sparkle of hope left: the car chases.
0.72 	 A very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement.
0.54 	 a thriller?
0.99 	 a romantic comedy?
0.98 	 I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.
0.55 	 Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din.
0.95 	 And speaking of "big"...whomever had the bright idea to fit Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty attire, which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin, should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober.
0.96 	 I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew, but I rented it basically because of the stars.
1.0 	 I certainly was not sorry.
0.97 	 The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family.
0.84 	 He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task.<br /><br />Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit.
0.91 	 Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself.
0.99 	 He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish.
0.91 	 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered.<br /><br />The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead are harsh and unattractive, and this is definitely not a feel-good movie.
0.64 	 It hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills.
0.99 	 A fine example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film.
0.95 	 She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend.
0.63 	 But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
0.89 	 As a movie critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see lot's of movies, and not all very good ones.
0.99 	 With taboo, IÃ¡m surprised that it is released on video at all.
0.94 	 <br /><br />A group of youngsters plays a game of taboo.
0.93 	 You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it.
0.99 	 That movie was clever, witty, and well-acted.
0.53 	 The 2nd Melinda is fine, but forgettable.<br /><br />Woody Allen's previous ensemble movies worked because, I'm guessing, he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented.
1.0 	 And while Chloe Sevigny is talented -- those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence.
0.83 	 The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones.<br /><br />Sad, very sad.
0.76 	 *****probably minor spoilers******<br /><br />I cant say i liked it, but i cant say i didn't...its very strange.
0.53 	 Sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of, so this movie does it good, maybe because its a low budget i don't know, but it works fine for me!
0.99 	 The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope.<br /><br />However, the Bob Hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical.
1.0 	 It's not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway.<br /><br />Ca vaut la peine!!
0.85 	 Mind, my friends and I saw the movie based off it's title alone.
0.86 	 My main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent, they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters.
1.0 	 and yes, British Columbia is lovely ***Or why they took it from its South Carolina Coastal setting?
1.0 	 I found the character in the book much more empathetic.
0.98 	 Also the book evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery.
0.97 	 While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.
0.8 	 For starters, "Hobgoblins" tries to ape the more successful "Gremlins".
0.77 	 Grrrr.... Meddling kids track down gremlin-like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies.
0.84 	 Well, see that wall on the other side of your room?
0.95 	 Run right at it, top speed, face first.
0.55 	 See, THAT is cooler than this movie.<br /><br />You dare to doubt?
0.96 	 Name another Rick Sloane directoral effort.
0.57 	 How many "Hobgoblins" action figures do you have?
0.71 	 See?
0.59 	 I'd rather write about more important things; like the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing.
1.0 	 I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT!
0.95 	 haan Pakeza'.Such acting is unheard of in this age of sex,dance and pornography.
0.92 	 The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started.
0.91 	 All in all, don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night.
0.95 	 Sure, this film might seem a little long, but it's the only version I've seen that includes part 3 of the story.<br /><br />I wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer Zeferelli version, as it would have helped that mess of a film.<br /><br />I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays "Aunt Reed"!
0.89 	 Rosamund Oliver is in it...she was completely cut out of the VHS.
1.0 	 I grew up on the 'Superman II' theatrical version ("S2T") and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman-type villains, it started off with a bang Â the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes.
0.97 	 (It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.)
1.0 	 Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening.
0.98 	 I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the "honeymoon suite."
0.89 	 Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child Â not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes.
0.95 	 And will he continue to "turn back time" for every confrontation?
0.99 	 Well, war is not going to happen as that is bad for business.
0.95 	 He promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (I honestly am not joking here).
0.95 	 Not one to be missed.
0.99 	 Main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment.
0.99 	 They took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash.
0.92 	 Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services.
0.85 	 I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, 15 minutes into the movie I was ready to leave.
0.82 	 Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting.
0.77 	 The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself.
0.8 	 An introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say.
0.76 	 This film acts like an introvert person.
0.99 	 that changes Anna's view on life and makes her suspicious.
0.96 	 asks Sebastiaan.
0.99 	 The answer for me: It shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water.
0.93 	 Motives behind their actions are not shown.
1.0 	 The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes.
0.56 	 In my opinion this film is made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.
0.98 	 At the same time, the movie points out that every prodigy is only human, and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being.
0.85 	 Just don't drive past that to Mobile, Alabama; That area still has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina.
0.99 	 I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot.
0.66 	 They changed everything I liked about the novel, even the plot.
0.51 	 !
0.96 	 It's a good thing The Score came along for Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I'd hate to think of him going out on Free Money.
0.94 	 Not what his fans ought to remember him by.<br /><br />Brando in his last years is looking more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film Welles would have done looking for financing of his own work.
0.9 	 Brando is the warden of a local prison which in America, when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area.
0.88 	 That gives one who is in charge a lot of clout.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Although Free Money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved.
0.97 	 Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight arrow FBI agent.<br /><br />Of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest American actor of the last century.
0.99 	 Contrary to popular belief, this title , to me at least, is not so very bad.
0.66 	 In fact.
0.98 	 Nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their, now badly cast US dub, counterparts.
0.88 	 I had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien' voices (please forgive the crude naming, it has been a while since i've seen it).
0.52 	 I feel and believe in the characters of this movie.
0.67 	 Dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago.
0.95 	 Personally i think its a big shame.
0.9 	 Had the correct audience been subject to it, i think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years.
0.8 	 However, without seeing the originals, a viewer wouldn't really notice.
0.87 	 Since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it back in its day.
0.57 	 I'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet Carl Macek, ill shake his hand for the effort, and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime.
0.97 	 It's the cream of the crop, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas.
0.72 	 Well MAN, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better.
0.99 	 See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out.
0.55 	 Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this!
0.69 	 Ever.
0.74 	 It's THAT bad.<br /><br />0/5 stars
0.96 	 I just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie.
0.99 	 This definitely wasn't what we were looking for, but it satisfied us for humor.
0.99 	 I'd be sprinting for my life!
0.78 	 Not to mention that the effects aren't that great, like whenever the clown chops off Susan's head in the forest, then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws the head back over.
0.73 	 Overall, I'd have to say I enjoyed the movie.
1.0 	 Sholay: Considered to be one of the greatest films.
0.72 	 I always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is.
0.93 	 That was the time RGV announced this movie and I was somewhat excited to see it.
0.82 	 I always thought that maybe this will be a good movie, but every week we would here RGV change something.
0.86 	 And the movie is a very B-Grade movie, something that I had not hoped.<br /><br />I really tried looking for positives, but I promised to keep Sholay out of my mind.
1.0 	 The cinematography is awesome.
0.56 	 But that is the up side.
0.64 	 None of the scenes excite you.
0.82 	 Ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original.
0.95 	 And none of the characters are developed.
0.97 	 Amitabh Bachchan was good as Gabbar Singh, nothing great.
0.93 	 Mohanlal is barely in the movie, but he impresses in his few scenes.
1.0 	 Prashant Raj is very confident, and has potential to make it far with better movies.<br /><br />I had most expectations for Sushmita Sen, who was probably the best of the lot.
0.82 	 She was expressive, but this still was not enough.
0.98 	 Nisha Kothari surprised me.
0.94 	 She seemed disinterested for the most part, but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good.
0.64 	 But what disappointed me most was chemistry.
0.72 	 Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj didn't look like friends.
0.73 	 Ajay-Nisha were not a strong couple.
0.72 	 No passion was to be found between Sushmita and Prashant.
1.0 	 It was however nicely danced.
1.0 	 The Holi number was enjoyable, but not memorable.
0.67 	 Same went for the other songs.
0.99 	 But hopefully he regains his talent for Sarkar Raj.
0.99 	 But this movie is best forgotten.
0.99 	 First, for old movie fans, it's interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger (no relation to Mick).
0.88 	 While Jagger later went on to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even garnering the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a full head of hair (I never saw him this way before) and because he was by far the worst actor in the film.
0.65 	 In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film class on how NOT to make a film.<br /><br />So, while giving it a 3 is probably a bit over-generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth a look for bad film fans.
1.0 	 In Iran, women are not permitted to attend men's sporting events, apparently to "protect" them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans (so since men can't restrain or behave themselves, women are forced to suffer.
0.93 	 As with many of those works, "Offside" is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative.
0.99 	 Stuck where they are, all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in, guards who are basically bumbling, good-natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service.
0.98 	 Even most of the men going into the stadium don't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in.
0.81 	 Still the prohibition persists.
0.85 	 And, yet, the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a "point."
0.53 	 No, I've never seen any of the "Santa Slasher" series, i.e.
0.81 	 'Silent Night, Deadly Night,' the original 'Black Christmas' or this one, 'Christmas Evil.'
0.67 	 I've heard all about their reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.)
0.94 	 We get a whiff of him being a little off-kilter, and he stalks both kids and parents alike.
0.99 	 It takes a good two-thirds of the film to get him to finally snap Â as if that's not foreshadowed from frame one.
0.88 	 NO MOVIE should take that long.<br /><br />I will admit, this movie had its tension building, but only because I kept expecting him to do something, anything to anyone.
0.53 	 When he finally does, well, punish "who's naughty," it's as graphic as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card.
0.94 	 (Take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing, and his solution is
uh, killing.)
0.98 	 Before seeing this "Emma" I had seen two previous versions, but in one Emma seemed all wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right, young and silly and stubborn.
0.52 	 Great group of actors.
0.83 	 Hopefully they'll put it out on DVD if they haven't already.
0.9 	 Please, for the love of God, don't watch it.
0.95 	 You'll be scarred for life...the image will never leave you!
0.76 	 Zombies?
0.9 	 Satire?
1.0 	 Shaun of the Dead was great!
1.0 	 Then forever your soul will be tormented!!
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 I never understood why some people dislike Bollywood films: they've got charismatic actors, great dance numbers, and heightened emotion--what's not to like?
0.95 	 Then I watched "Garam Masala".
0.84 	 In fact, the characters are never really developed at all.
0.62 	 The males are boorish, greedy jerks, and the women merely interchangeably beautiful.
0.67 	 If you go by this movie, you would think that "air hostesses" are pretty easy to pass from man to man.
0.97 	 In reality, betrayal is not so humorous.
0.96 	 <br /><br />The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets, and a few slapsticky moments involving the French-farce, door-slamming aspects of the story.
0.96 	 But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan, and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, who seem to have influenced writer/director Priyadarshan not a little.
0.61 	 The original author of that work, Marc Camoletti, is credited nowhere.
0.61 	 The first and second seasons started off shakily, with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones, and at times resorting to clichÃ©d stories.
0.66 	 I was fully amped up to see this film.
0.69 	 I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand.
0.99 	 First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick.
0.96 	 He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually.
1.0 	 I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'.
0.99 	 It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever top it.
0.97 	 I mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like "The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ" or something.
0.99 	 The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess.
0.81 	 Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least.
1.0 	 Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife.
0.78 	 This film is available from David Shepard and Kino on the Before Hollywood There Was Fort Lee, NJ, although that is a shortened version with just the "behind-the-scenes movie sections.
0.7 	 I'm not sure if Blackhawk Films only had a film print of these parts, or they edited out the other scenes.
0.96 	 The complete feature does survive, but the preprint for this version had some nitrate decomposition, and a couple of sections looked bad, so that may be why Blackhawk's version was edited.<br /><br />Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film has Tourneur playing himself, or more likely a caricature of himself.
0.98 	 Mary sees an Indian (in full headdress) and raises an alarm -- spoiling a scene that the movie company is filming.
0.98 	 The doors and walls are just flats that are hastily assembled for the set.
0.85 	 That lanky walk of the western hero or the happy skip of the heroine are just acting too.
1.0 	 The signs on the wall say "Positively No Smoking", but everybody smokes anyway.
1.0 	 His plans are dashed when Mary's screen-test is a stinker.
0.85 	 We don't get to see the actual film, but only the audience's pained reactions to it.<br /><br />Mary is devastated, but she doesn't want to admit to everyone back home that she was a failure, so she continues to see Driscoll and we she has lunch with him in the studio cafeteria along with other extras dressed as policemen, soldiers, cowboys, etc.<br /><br />Mary decides to stay with Driscoll.
0.95 	 If you've always wondered what went on behind the scenes when a silent film was being made, this movie peeks behind the curtain.
0.71 	 Sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget, But it had a very Hitchcock-like plot and I can honestly say that when I viewed the non-MST3K version, I was genuinely entertained.
0.99 	 But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious ad-libs.
0.97 	 Despite the unevenness of much of the picture, Karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures.
1.0 	 I did not intend to write this review, but having read the default review that shows up on this movie's URL, I felt compelled to write a rebuttal.
0.95 	 It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written.
0.85 	 I think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent.
0.96 	 In fact, I too was turned off by the excessive show of Evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent.
0.96 	 However, I must beg to differ with the reviewer in that, this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action.
1.0 	 I think, what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers, how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic, simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another.
1.0 	 And if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome.
0.87 	 Please note the last scene of the movie, if you don't get this!
0.98 	 I do agree with the reviewer in that, the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much.
1.0 	 However, given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie, I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist Â basher!
0.98 	 However, I did not find any specialty in her acting.
0.98 	 If it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think, if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place!
0.67 	 Although leone directed both 'Fistful' and 'West', his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different.
0.97 	 The 'Man With No Name' (Eastwood) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families.
0.9 	 These two characters would not have had much to do with each other.
0.93 	 There are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that, if executed clearly, could have elevated it from Spaghetti-western blandness into something special.
0.99 	 Stella Stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband.
0.94 	 Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw.
0.6 	 Fernando Rey is in it too (as a blind man).
0.99 	 How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me.
0.75 	 For 3 reasons, 1.
0.68 	 Jessica Alba and 3.
0.99 	 She dresses like a bat but she's not a grown-up Batgirl.
0.96 	 And Batman is denying any affiliation with her.
0.98 	 But the Penguin, Bain and the local Mob makes things little more complicated.<br /><br />I didn't have high hopes for this 'un since being strongly let down but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn't featured so much here!
0.93 	 This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without.
0.99 	 I find this extremely annoying considering Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen.
0.97 	 Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me.<br /><br />I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5.
0.8 	 The cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it.
0.96 	 I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her and I am sorry about that.
0.56 	 I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to Steven Hyde.
0.81 	 Daraar got off to a pretty good start.
0.83 	 All the first half of the movie is about is Rishi Kapoor falling head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla.
0.85 	 ?<br /><br />Things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a lunatic is he!
0.94 	 He was an over-protective, neat-freak with a really HOT TEMPER!
0.58 	 One of the reasons I really don't like this movie is because I can't stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) get so abused.
1.0 	 Shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story, the film utilizes David Lynch inspired visuals with Fassbinder inspired acting.
0.56 	 But the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here.
0.94 	 Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong types.
0.98 	 We are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do.
0.83 	 Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs.
0.8 	 As one Bugundian resident quotes, "we're English and we always were English, and it's just because we are English, we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians" <br /><br />A sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor Bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them, by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades.<br /><br />Will Whitehall, who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new batch of foreigners, especially as these ones are English!!!!
0.96 	 Not to be missed.
0.91 	 There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible.
0.81 	 RE was a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along.
0.66 	 Basically, what I can understand is that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him.
0.8 	 Instead, I highly recommend that, if you must see this film, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.<br /><br />The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little, right?
0.85 	 The demons look somewhat cool, though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect.
0.57 	 The same is true of Dorff, who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot).
0.75 	 If they keep ruining the spirit like this, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens.
0.99 	 Maybe because I expected too much from this film and that's why i was slightly disappointed.
0.93 	 But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another.
0.97 	 How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old's horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we've all known and loathed since the first film?
0.8 	 We've seen him so many times before.
0.96 	 Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor, and sometimes it shines through the cracks here, but she can't save this movie.
0.88 	 Nobody will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously again after seeing this film.
1.0 	 Pathetic.<br /><br />Of all the movies I could hate, why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St, a series which I once adored and liked a lot?
1.0 	 The Dream Child represents the death of a legend, and the shattering of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St. series.
0.99 	 This film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making.
0.56 	 Other countries need to take heed.
0.52 	 stories had me thinking "This is going to be a classic" But it was all down hill from there!
0.99 	 The acting was brilliant, for what it's worth William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in.
0.51 	 4/10
0.58 	 This was a quite brutal movie.
0.51 	 5.5/10
0.89 	 The movie is a biased viewpoint of the director Christian Duguay Â who shows Hitler as a one-track, menacing, angry, and shouting person Â who had such a strong hold on the Germans and people around him.
0.99 	 Hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction, and there the movie fails to convince Hitler's portrayal.<br /><br />Even though the venture was for TV, all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie.
0.71 	 The production value, sets, costumes, etc.
0.72 	 Robert Carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does.
0.6 	 As I have told several times, that Â very sadly - our society loves to garland or prosecute one person, as a representative of the society's good or evil respectively.
0.99 	 Well actually i don't know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies, then perhaps you may find this movie astounding (this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer).
0.89 	 The first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers relishing their vacation in Florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are.
0.67 	 As far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines.
0.75 	 A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation.
0.54 	 One thing that did however amaze me about this movie, was how much betty (im not sure about her name..the blonde character) looks like reese witherspoon.
0.94 	 Another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times.
0.89 	 Does that make it a work of art?
1.0 	 Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have scammed their way through college.
0.97 	 Jaime) King, who was very appealing - and deserved better.<br /><br />This gets no more than one out of ten from me.
1.0 	 His brother, an electrical genius, gives the 'colossus' impetus to transfer thoughts into motion.
0.98 	 And it is humorous that this is not scary a bit.
0.99 	 Well, very small kids will think this is good.
0.92 	 If you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on....night, night.<br /><br />The lead characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin.
0.97 	 Ed Wolff played the 'Colossus'.
0.96 	 '<br /><br />Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence.
1.0 	 Considering its pedigree, this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is.
1.0 	 Even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold?
0.99 	 James Stewart was a fine comedian, as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey.
0.57 	 The "accidental nightmare" sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed.
0.96 	 So yesterday, I wandered into a local used book/movie store and found a VHS copy.
0.86 	 And if it doesn't work out, we're heartbroken and we think that we'll never get over it.
0.77 	 But of course we do.
0.72 	 The feeling of "Oooh!
0.95 	 According to the makers of this movie, 'beauty' can be only experienced in Bob-Ross-style kitschy landscape paintings.
0.92 	 Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic (like, primary school level) color theory and lots of sentiment.
0.95 	 Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film.
0.88 	 I wanted to hear other returning vets feelings in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened.
0.66 	 The paramount statement of the entire movie is "Take Action" on the problem .
0.6 	 Her take on her time spent in the sand is that she did some good.
0.75 	 Local Balad children got first rate medical treatment for various common ailments not ordinarily able to afford free with an escort and translator.
0.98 	 Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now only seems to do "by the numbers" Hollywood thrillers.<br /><br />This is very lightweight John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie.
0.99 	 Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers.
0.97 	 Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make an uncomfortable duo.
1.0 	 It's to the point and far more exciting.
0.56 	 A gave it a "2" instead of a "1" (awful) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork.
0.65 	 But that wasn't enough to save it.<br /><br />The "sepia" toned, washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies.
1.0 	 I can see there were some hat-tips to other old, classic movies.
0.68 	 The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap.
0.57 	 Most of the singing is off-key.
0.8 	 I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it...
0.51 	 I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row, but it was not to be.
0.96 	 The best I could say would be that it aspires to be an Altman-esque film, albeit with an extremely small ensemble.
0.53 	 I do not understand the high rating for this film.
1.0 	 The tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget.
0.98 	 Looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video output.
0.58 	 How had I not heard of this film before this website?
1.0 	 In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs.
0.89 	 It's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end.
0.91 	 At least Gleason had his moments.
0.57 	 Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff.
0.82 	 Take:<br /><br />1.
0.93 	 a famous play<br /><br />2.
0.74 	 a director with now ideas of his own who is using<br /><br />3.
0.98 	 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1.<br /><br />4.
0.96 	 It won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings.
0.61 	 I ask myself how Schell could get the part of Hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play Hamlet a second time.
0.96 	 Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie.
0.83 	 Want more entertainment...stare at a wall.
0.84 	 So It was made in 1972, so what.
0.76 	 The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time.
0.88 	 People who didn't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball.
0.81 	 However, the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion, which again was over 30 years in the past.
0.61 	 BUT.
0.98 	 There is just so much to say, but I refuse to say it.
0.88 	 (for fear of spoiling it) So go out and see this film!
0.51 	 If you don't like the message that it sends, then you have issues, that need some attention!
0.98 	 I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written, poorly shot, has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that it's not real in its portrayal of life.
0.99 	 Hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives.
0.98 	 Is it right, no!
0.58 	 9 out of 10 from me for this one.
0.97 	 Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone.<br /><br />Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.<br /><br />Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon.
0.99 	 She is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously nearÂ-and the whole thing is revealed to be Angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed.
0.87 	 She then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine.
0.98 	 He refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled.<br /><br />Then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film.
0.74 	 The problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill.
0.97 	 Again De Palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered, as Angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties, that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease, and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle.
0.69 	 When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair.
0.9 	 It's all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, you think; "Woah, that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative!"
0.7 	 He Interviews Michael Caine, making the outrageous implication (though it passes as commonplace) that Angie WANTED to be killed.
0.99 	 You have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower.
0.89 	 De Palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing.
0.83 	 Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place.
1.0 	 The clunky, plodding (non)direction, trite by-the-numbers script, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murder set pieces (a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon!
0.99 	 ), overwrought string score, morbid gloom-doom atmosphere, largely lousy acting (Karloff notably excepted), cheesy mild gore, poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm.
1.0 	 Absolutely fantastic.
0.57 	 Of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence.
0.94 	 What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical.
0.93 	 I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema.
0.7 	 For my part I came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making.
0.76 	 Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.<br /><br />P.S.
0.7 	 Once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world.
0.54 	 The oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition.
1.0 	 Although the situation looks hopeless.... (I'm not going to tell you the ending).
0.99 	 Where to begin ... first, Campbell Scott's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish, curiosity and anger.
0.68 	 You don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my Friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection.
0.7 	 <br /><br />Give this film a go and you won't be disappointed.
1.0 	 It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone, Brian DePalma, Al Pacino, and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage.
0.94 	 Is it based on a true story.
0.87 	 But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine.
0.65 	 Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans?
0.86 	 The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values.
0.84 	 It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida.
0.7 	 Is this a romance novel.
0.68 	 The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other.
0.82 	 It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours.
0.95 	 But at least a drama series has some kind of focus.
1.0 	 This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States.
0.94 	 However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site.
0.68 	 I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow.
0.86 	 The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis.
0.99 	 Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
0.56 	 What a family I have.
0.77 	 I must warn you though, this isn't gut-busting funny.
0.56 	 It has its moments but not as funny as There's Something About Mary.
0.88 	 Check it out anyway.
0.76 	 Unless your an anti-drug activist or something.
0.91 	 If you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating.
0.93 	 Only a woman, from out of town, would follow the shady bartender to a solitary elevated subway.
0.58 	 It was a real explicit invitation, first to the "phantom woman" of the story, Fay Helm; afterward, Cliff the drummer, insinuates himself very openly to Ella Raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally.<br /><br />This is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning.
0.94 	 The killer is not revealed until the end.
0.52 	 <br /><br />Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an under estimated actress.
0.79 	 Back in the day, I remembered seeing dumb Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me!
0.78 	 First off, I hate the new characters.
0.82 	 I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant.
0.99 	 Bad move, 4Kids TV!
0.61 	 Kirby'll never beat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness.
0.78 	 NUF SAID!!
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 There are a lot of highly talented filmmakers/actors in Germany now.
0.98 	 What IS funny though is that the film's producer (who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch) is playing the YOUNGEST dwarf.<br /><br />The film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying "You're supposed to laugh now!".
0.9 	 No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts.
0.88 	 The movie is just based on biblical facts.
0.81 	 However, I did not like the lighting in this movie... for a movie dealing with such subject matter, it was too bright.
0.71 	 Another cult strikes again.
0.65 	 I can only hope that they "truly believe they can walk on water" enough to take that guidance to it's "logical" conclusion...in other words; walk, drown...or shut up :-) As a movie...it deserves a strong "1" on it's entertainment value, especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history (the photographer's roommate...eeeeeek!).
0.91 	 Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy.
0.55 	 They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature.
0.92 	 They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals.
1.0 	 Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br />Although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake.
0.59 	 The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training.
0.93 	 The plot was weird, Drew Barrymore and DC making out was awkward for both of them.
0.96 	 Drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time.
1.0 	 that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool, which is OK i guess but it could have been more.
0.99 	 <br /><br />....and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it?
0.99 	 <br /><br />It was very confusing as to when it was the Doppelganger weird thing or when it was DC-or was it Dennis all the time?
0.57 	 Because the Doppelganger made out with Dennis and Patrick.
0.9 	 In the scenes with Patrick if it was Dennis as the Doppelganger then I think Patrick would notice.<br /><br />The music was OK but obtrusive in places, the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.<br /><br />A big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of Drew nude.
1.0 	 This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II.
0.78 	 And that's the audience this serial is designed for.
0.89 	 Well, this is Republic pictures, 1944.
0.79 	 There is NOTHING cool, hip, or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.86 	 SERIAL KILLERS!
0.77 	 What really makes an artwork cool is profundity, questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history (or, in this case, a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable!).
0.83 	 These same violent events actually HAPPEN, every day.
0.69 	 Do you WANT those things done to you?
0.76 	 I can see director Miike's demented fans now: chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos, with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces, their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .<br /><br />There is NO PLOT to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence.
0.99 	 It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic, BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE!
0.97 	 There are PLENTY out there, directed by Fellini, Bergman, Fassbinder, Herzog, Altman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Lynch, Tarkovsky, Peter Greenaway, Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Richard Linklater, Eisenstein, Aronofsky, Gus van Sant, Soderbergh, Shyamalan, Ordet.
0.99 	 Why don't you view a REAL art film by the likes of these giants?
0.98 	 There are long lists of ART Films to learn from--but THIS "Visitor Q" is NOT an art film in any respect.
0.69 	 Do you WANT those things done to you?
0.68 	 To others?
0.98 	 It's not imaginative or even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world.
0.73 	 Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film, and I'm still not sure it isn't, actually.
0.91 	 <br /><br />Your actions have consequences, son.
0.56 	 I'm not sure quite why I clicked "contains spoiler", because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it.<br /><br />Visually it mostly delivers.
0.94 	 Well, apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters.
0.65 	 Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band, pretty much in their stage personas.
0.72 	 Must have been the mood I was in, but I found that hella funny for some reason.
0.99 	 That amused me further, and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10.<br /><br />It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's pretty nice visually and sonically.
0.78 	 Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood.
0.68 	 Where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones?
0.9 	 After all he did serve for 17+ years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering.
0.99 	 Oh I forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most Powerful nation on Earth.
1.0 	 I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying, since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done (Louise Brooks is clearly speaking English, so there's no way her lips could be matched.)
0.64 	 Also, the film is made entirely in the silent style, with few titles and little need for dialogue.
0.97 	 Nathan Detroit, played by Frank Sinatra, needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse Big Julie, a Chicago Mob Boss.
0.87 	 He bets odds-player Sky Masterson, well-presented by Marlon Brando, that he cannot get a Salvation Army girl to go to Havana with him; Masterson wins the bet, saves the Mission, falls in love with the girl, gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service, and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms--a complete lie.
0.96 	 Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster, Sheldon Leonard, Regis Toomey, Mary Alan Kokanson, Kathryn Givney as the Salvation Army leader, Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl, Sarah Brown.
0.99 	 The acting is very uneven.
0.55 	 scenes.
0.95 	 Greetings again from the darkness.
1.0 	 What ever happened to the great Barry Levinson?
1.0 	 He directed two of my all-time favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner".
0.99 	 He had some fine movies as well ("Rainman"), but always provided something of interest ... until now.
0.62 	 The best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a Redbone sound-alike.
1.0 	 Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize they all want to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes one weaknesses.
0.86 	 I am a student of film, and have been for several years.
0.54 	 Let's face it, America has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar.
1.0 	 After such great classics as "Monkey Trouble" and "Dunston Checks In", I thought that the best ideas were already taken.
1.0 	 But then comes "Funky Monkey".
0.88 	 Let me sum up this work of art: A company by the name of Z.I.T.
0.6 	 Clemens is everything Z.I.T.
0.5 	 hoped for.
0.88 	 Being a CIA agent and all, Modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city, rent a guest room, regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime, and using checks to pay for everything.<br /><br />Z.I.T.
1.0 	 finds out where Modine is staying, and sends two of their finest to retrieve him.
1.0 	 These guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since Martin and Lewis, or was it Turner and Hooch?
0.53 	 Yay!
0.97 	 Throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself, a lonely mom who needs a date, and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by Radio Disney and you get "Funky Monkey".
0.93 	 A football game!
0.99 	 It's edge of your seat entertainment.
0.99 	 Some might even call this the "American Beauty" of monkey-filled features.
0.94 	 After finishing this epic, I recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe.
1.0 	 Funky Monkey is a metal rod among movies.
0.99 	 This is an hybrid creature born at Carl Macek mind.
0.92 	 If this movie have so high rank is for the TV series and not for itself!!
0.86 	 when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie.
0.93 	 Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt.
0.98 	 On the face of it, Ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller.
1.0 	 Although it's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre, there are compensations.
1.0 	 The tensions generated between Huppert and Balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling; however, in a true European art-house style, Ruiz doesn't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other.
1.0 	 Instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men.
0.76 	 The boy, Camille (Nils Hugon), decides on a practical joke, playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman.
0.71 	 In the background is an intemperate psychologist (Charles Berling), swift to confront the women in his life - his sister Huppert, the nanny or his pa - and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the, calm and (we learn) manipulative Camille.
0.94 	 It is particularly interesting that, like the father in Henry James' The Turn of The Screw, Denis Podalydes' law-enforcer Father is absent for the duration of the film.
1.0 	 I'm officially rather fed up with Mme Huppert's screen method, which is too buried and so I'll be looking to see her on stage before I come back to her (European - enjoyed Heaven's Gate) films again.
0.98 	 The support is good.
0.64 	 The set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot - the tension I have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential.<br /><br />Want to see a good contemporary French thriller?
0.51 	 4/10
0.82 	 It did remind me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene, and I would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers.
0.85 	 I don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after watching things like "the wire", I've come to expect great things from cop drama.
0.94 	 And I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face.
0.99 	 They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days.
0.81 	 All this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are outlawed.
0.73 	 A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical.
0.73 	 he died by getting shot in the eye.
0.99 	 I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week.
0.78 	 I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that.
0.8 	 I was looking for something bold.
0.89 	 I'm writing this because I somehow felt being led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie.
0.62 	 The "suspense" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.<br /><br />To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors' episodes.
0.81 	 But not quite on par with quality movies yet.
0.97 	 As for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
0.98 	 I happened on "Shower" in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy.
0.94 	 The movie proposes that he's "best friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate Stiller hates Black.
0.75 	 Walken gives a good performance but Black is off-key and annoying (and I usually find him very funny).
0.9 	 The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summed up by the opening scene .
0.62 	 Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they're driving in crashes but Dial manages to escape .
1.0 	 This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day .
0.96 	 Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films .
0.8 	 Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he's someone best known for appearing in straight to DVD fare these days , and he's basically playing a cameo role anyway .
0.99 	 Bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away.
0.99 	 So, let's see...Mira Sorvino, whose judge husband has been shot while protecting her, goes from Madrid to Seville for her cop job.
0.99 	 She teams up with male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and nice Feodor Atkine.
0.78 	 A : ah-ah-ah.
0.71 	 Spider-man got relaesed the same day.
0.85 	 yi-ha.<br /><br />Then it wants to play on the same playgroung as US thrillers/slashers/whodunit/mysteries/whatever.
0.69 	 Wrong : done in flash-backs in a Traffic-like photography, it's certainly the most interesting thing i n the movie.
0.9 	 Better go straight to Guillermo del Tros's THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El espinazo del diablo)for some clever fun.<br /><br />Then the homophobia.
0.87 	 Bullseye!
0.52 	 The first murders are plain illusion as they're a representation of a famous painting.
0.92 	 A Giant, mega-bore.
0.96 	 The scenes of the holy week are needless (maybe a co-production rule saying : ok, shoot in Sevilla but show some creditsof this beautiful and historical town with the celebrations of Easter.
0.77 	 There we are : a mystery movie for tourists!
1.0 	 Only do we pay great respect to Alida Valli, one of the greatest actress this last century (and I hope for some more roles in this current one).
0.96 	 It starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments, until Timon complains that "we're not here yet".
0.87 	 They start the new movie, and the laughs begin.<br /><br />To be honest, I was losing hope in Disney.
1.0 	 Most of their direct-to-video fare has been aggressively awful, with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original.
0.73 	 In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script.
1.0 	 (OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.
0.76 	 )But to me that's all there is.
0.91 	 The story did develop quite well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most don't have any information missing.<br /><br />The only thing I can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character Lizzie.<br /><br />Some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line.
0.56 	 The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson's character at his peak or Streisand's character struggling.
1.0 	 The final Streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finales in film, if it was directed and edited properly.
0.99 	 Had the band, audience and wide shots of the stage been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting.
0.59 	 I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film.
0.96 	 I love Ben Stiller's acting.
0.9 	 I loved it in most of his films, the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad.
0.72 	 About Jack Black... Well, apart from High Fidelity I've never seen him doing something good.
0.91 	 What about School of Rock?
0.83 	 I'm surprised about the many female voters who even give this film better marks.
0.74 	 The opening and the hand-smashing are DJANGO rip-offs.
0.88 	 THE SHOOTER however lacks the style of e.g.
0.76 	 DJANGO.
0.96 	 Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico "Border Cop".
1.0 	 He serves as a father figure to young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be best man at his impending wedding.
0.97 	 Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be tougher.
0.75 	 Although it doesn't end up being worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show.
0.98 	 <br /><br />** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
1.0 	 It is incredible!!
1.0 	 I liked Wesley Snipes, and I founded funny that he played his name's meaning in a movie.
0.51 	 Inwatchable!!
1.0 	 ..Only one good think: that wonderful girl!
0.51 	 Eeeeh!!
0.9 	 So have grate time, and see good films, like i try too.. Peace!
0.99 	 plot and dialog, the most amazing aspect of "Lady..." is the berserk casting.
0.99 	 Gene Wilder (star AND co-writer) tries hard at it all: he plays a romantic lead (with his looks!!
0.79 	 and his age!!
0.93 	 he and Woody Allen should start a club for clueless, mirrorless ageing comedians), and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart, and tries to sing and dance, and succeeds in NONE!!
0.93 	 The guy who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies!!
0.71 	 Mike Starr's over-the-top acting as the most incompetent, phoniest cop you EVER saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history.
0.51 	 - 1/10
0.64 	 Do families like this really exist somewhere?
0.9 	 There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such, and I think that that is a great description of how they behaved.<br /><br />More absurdly unbelievable writing/acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as "pigface" who, of course, has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date.
0.62 	 In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it's so...so...unreal.
0.88 	 This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French musicals out there.
0.68 	 If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals, not every French musical is gold.
0.87 	 <br /><br />Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured I was prepared for anything it would offer.
0.78 	 I was clearly deceived after seeing...well...everything, to cut a long story short.
0.98 	 I can see why it was banned, not only for such explicit sex scenes, but for beastiality.
0.83 	 <br /><br />But that's not all.
0.8 	 Oh, there is so much more!
0.99 	 <br /><br />Not only do we get to see interspecial sex, but there's also humping horses, the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she's not humping the bed to get her...er...satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals.
0.62 	 It may be fun, but I doubt there are other porn films like this one.
0.91 	 I know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original, however sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits.
0.74 	 The only thing I would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little.
0.59 	 I wish he had stayed with this version and been the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, that would have me grinning for an hour.
0.71 	 Good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then.
0.97 	 Neither of these films are out on any format and I can't imagine why.
1.0 	 Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects.
0.95 	 Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13.
0.93 	 She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital.
0.71 	 She escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives.
0.98 	 The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts.
0.99 	 It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off, you could do a lot worse than checking this out, you won't regret it.
1.0 	 Lionel Barrymore is an utter swine, Neil Hamilton is poor but dashing and Carol Dempster is.... well, Carol Dempster is most of what is wrong with Griffith in this period, but she doesn't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama.<br /><br />Note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released, but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Stack's Hadley Oil Company uses.
0.97 	 The action movies of today are badly done The actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly.
1.0 	 The end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass Jackie was badly hurt.
1.0 	 ok. for starters, taxi driver is amazing.
0.94 	 this, this is not taxi driver or amazing.
0.56 	 yeah, it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least can try to.
0.59 	 (if I wasn't clear: GET THE MOVIE INTO VIDEOSTORES!
0.52 	 )<br /><br />can't be explained - must see!
0.96 	 ** possible spoilers **<br /><br />I like this film and have no problem staying awake for it.
0.58 	 Like Veronica says, two chicks at one time.
0.87 	 I get into the conversations too.
0.99 	 Even if they are utterly b.s.
0.83 	 at times, so what?
1.0 	 Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s.
0.94 	 It's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s.
0.59 	 Mmmm?
0.95 	 They are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />I like the film though.
0.91 	 I expected more from her.
0.87 	 An example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90's flick "The Phantom," starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane.
0.9 	 Rent the movie and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving graces in the film.
0.96 	 The pace is rapid-fire in the first half of the movie, and a snail's pace in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to figure out who the key villain is as well.
0.92 	 The pairing is rather clichÃ©d, also- Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly-ended romance, and their story isn't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched.
1.0 	 When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobody's surprised, and nobody really cares either.<br /><br />Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout.
0.99 	 But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie, falls flat on its face.
0.68 	 I hate the show.
0.54 	 everyone's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big.
0.91 	 WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING???!!!?!?!?!?!
0.96 	 days before the movie premiere on Nick, most of the teen girl actresses on Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.)
0.99 	 showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are.
0.93 	 this guy's lucky if he ever manages to get laid.
0.92 	 Her name is Allie DiMeco.
0.63 	 I'll tell ya, the Naked Brothers are gonna be in some deep sh** when their "fans" find out the whole thing is staged.
0.51 	 0/10
0.98 	 STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking movie until the very end.
1.0 	 ), the movie challenges one's thoughts about mortality, fate, and sacrifice.<br /><br />The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain former English majors.
0.95 	 Her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith.<br /><br />Ah, but the ending.
1.0 	 The movie as a metaphor for life's journey, as a tribute to the notion of 'writing true,' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy, but not both, is outstanding.
0.99 	 And no matter how endearing a character he may have become, we know full well why we will accept the ending.
1.0 	 A profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film.
1.0 	 I've read you're brilliant.
1.0 	 One good thing came from me seeing this movie: I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now.
0.71 	 This is a far cry from the crappy live action Conan, not to speak of all the B-movie of the genre.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!
0.65 	 I don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie.
0.93 	 There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that.
0.56 	 Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The script was very good as was the acting.
0.96 	 <br /><br />I was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever.
0.62 	 <br /><br />This movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment.
0.55 	 I rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie, since I'm a big football fan.
0.96 	 This movie pretty much says that if your a Christian you can get anything you want in life easily, like become a great football player!
0.97 	 You don't become a great football player by becoming Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work.
0.67 	 All you gotta do is ask God and he'll give you anything....puh-lease.
0.66 	 no, the dude that flew over the Atlantic, etc etc..) but really this movie wasn't that great.
0.55 	 It's definitely worth listening to him recite "High Flight" and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with Shakespeare.
0.53 	 Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead (who got the idea of making her a blonde?).
0.84 	 Having the In-Laws over for the weekend?
1.0 	 An interesting piece of added amusement is playing "Spot the Villain" as passengers join the ship.
1.0 	 No great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being.
0.77 	 The only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them.
0.51 	 :(
0.9 	 But first i thought that it was the original film.
0.64 	 The actors and special effects were good.
0.71 	 If you haven't seen it, go see it.
0.65 	 I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hoped it would do: entertain.
0.99 	 It just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie.
0.79 	 !<br /><br />It also looks as if it was made in 1972
1.0 	 The cinematography was great.
0.97 	 When the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes I thought that I was in for a good movie.
0.98 	 I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren.
0.86 	 I'm a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian.
0.82 	 Let me give you a rÃ©sumÃ© in a few sentences.
0.52 	 Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker.
0.58 	 The housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist.
0.98 	 She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti fascist is gay.
0.98 	 Despite of this they make love with each other.
0.83 	 At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents.
1.0 	 On a side note my sister loved this movie.
0.93 	 Like I said, I'm a Cultural Barbarian...
1.0 	 He did a fabulous job acting as a "renegade" cop within a "renegade" department.
1.0 	 From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in.
1.0 	 He acts as a sort of "gentle giant" -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job.
1.0 	 He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.<br /><br />This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards.
0.89 	 After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down.
0.98 	 His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner.
0.99 	 There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role.
0.57 	 I was hoping to see more from him in this film.<br /><br />Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry.
0.98 	 Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts.
0.76 	 Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life.
0.93 	 Personally, it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic.
0.99 	 Make me believe that the story is true.
0.59 	 This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied.
0.64 	 Other than Susan Hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made.
1.0 	 The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made.
0.82 	 Not that anyone else is good.
0.86 	 There's not a single performance (outside Henry Fonda's delightful cameo) that is even passable.
1.0 	 One bright spot: the cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big-screen Imax productions have not quite done so well.
0.93 	 It suggests more of the latter than the former, and thus is pretty disturbing.
0.72 	 I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill," "Wild Bill Hickok," and "Calamity Jane," all of whom are in this story!
1.0 	 Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great.
0.74 	 This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor.<br /><br />In a nutshell, his western shot blanks.
0.8 	 Head up the pass and watch another oater because most of 'em were far better than this one.
0.99 	 Turns out, the monkey watches all the popular shows, and can easily pick the hits.
0.65 	 Russell discovers the chimp's talent, and uses him to advance his own career.
0.99 	 A look through the cast will reveal s bunch of fun TV actors to recognize and try to place.
0.62 	 You could make a drinking game, in honor of Raffles' beer-guzzling, by guessing actors, and where you've seen them before.
0.74 	 Here's a start - Hey, isn't that "Dr. Bellows" from "I Dream of Jeannie"?
0.99 	 <br /><br />**** The Barefoot Executive (1971) Robert Butler ~ Kurt Russell, Joe Flynn, John Ritter
1.0 	 "Stella", starring Bette Midler in the title role, is an unabashed tearjerker.
0.99 	 Set in upstate New York, Stella Claire works nights as a bar maid, pouring and dancing in a workingman's saloon.
0.97 	 She spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion, sends him packing to a lucrative medical career, and raises her daughter herself in near-poverty.
1.0 	 Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous, loving, young lady.
0.9 	 The chief offender is Bette Midler, but close behind is John Goodman as her alcoholic buddy.
0.8 	 From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much laugh the whole time.
0.91 	 I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose.
0.97 	 It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like.
0.67 	 It's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____.
0.72 	 I laugh every time I listen to the "I'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow.
0.74 	 I have been using IMDb for years and I never wanted to get involved in the commentary of movies
until now.
0.6 	 This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say.
0.83 	 <br /><br />The problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary.
0.88 	 This is certainly the case with Islam: What the West Needs to Know.
0.99 	 This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more.<br /><br />For those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that may help.
0.99 	 I watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking.
0.86 	 Surrah 98:6 is a good example.
0.65 	 The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell.
0.88 	 Obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways, but 'Urf is meant to be "good" behavior, what an average person would consider right or wrong.<br /><br />The documentary presents Shar'ia (Islamic Law) as being one unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow.
0.7 	 There are many Islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law.
0.94 	 <br /><br />The Hadith tradition is similar.
0.64 	 Using the Hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real and applicable, is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say
 which is what the documentary did.<br /><br />What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion.
0.95 	 But if you feel you have AN answer you can work together with other people's views about politics, religion, God, or whatever.
0.72 	 They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build.<br /><br />This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel.
1.0 	 Very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning.
0.7 	 I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end.
0.91 	 Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting.
0.86 	 Supposed to be a comedy.
0.86 	 It's hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing.
0.88 	 I have seen it so many times I have stopped counting.
0.57 	 It's also got a doozy of a plot twist...and a very ambiguous moral message.
0.6 	 This is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it.
0.95 	 Too bad director Bill Paxton had to go hire himself to star...oh well....still a devil of a good rent.
0.75 	 The girl roommate character (from That 70's Show) was the only person worth watching.
0.89 	 She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in.
0.7 	 The others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they'll need a career other than acting.
0.76 	 There are so many flaws in the storytelling that I don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience.
0.84 	 Financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as the director.
0.83 	 What happened?
0.86 	 Two things: Busby Berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street.
0.99 	 Carl Brisson's acting is bland as Melba Toast but he's a competent singer.
0.99 	 MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective.
1.0 	 Feb 2010 re-think: I recently gave the film another look and now feel I was wrong to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers.
0.61 	 Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's Search for Beauty).
0.98 	 Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about.
0.78 	 do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0.7 	 He was yet to see the movie and, boy, was he in for a surprise.
0.99 	 Donald Sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again.
0.98 	 The first is that I really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful.
0.85 	 It is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles around in a canoe for a while, then... leaves, never to be seen again).
0.99 	 My favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door (!?)
0.72 	 This movie looked good - good cast, evergreen topic and an explosive opening.
0.87 	 It shakes, judders, part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer.
0.9 	 How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending?
0.73 	 Doh!
0.91 	 This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud.
0.91 	 The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting.
0.94 	 Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear.
0.83 	 See this film at your own risk.
1.0 	 Before starting to watch the show, I've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting.
0.88 	 It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer.
0.81 	 That question will be coursing through your minds in 5 Â 10 minutes after you hit Play.
0.53 	 Why are their dolls with the word "food" drawn on them?
0.76 	 bore fest except where this clown lives.
0.6 	 I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film.
0.52 	 It was an interesting premise (clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially) and I'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a B-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video.
1.0 	 Ah, but that cover art...pretty awesome drawing.
0.64 	 I have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of Spirit.
0.98 	 As usual, Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie.
0.75 	 Well done.
0.51 	 Hey guys - you get what you pay for:)
0.72 	 Even Sykes' dog Bullseye puts on a good performance.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone.
0.78 	 People who hate musicals will despise it, as will those who take musicals too seriously.
1.0 	 Nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage-type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment.
0.99 	 I'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the American Revolutionary War.
0.98 	 -- and that of Nastassja Kinski, who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England(!!).
0.97 	 Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer/pederast.
0.89 	 Hugh Hudson's career never recovered.
0.67 	 This horror tale finds a newly married husband(John Hudson)and wife(Peggy Weber)haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond.
0.8 	 Or is it the learning challenged gardener Mickey(Alex Nicol)who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house?
0.6 	 This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale.
0.98 	 Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is character actor Russ Conway.
0.85 	 You can catch this as part of AMC's Monsterfest.
0.98 	 Apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era.
1.0 	 Nuremberg (and a lot of forgotten trials all over Europe) was a revenge and injustice of the winners.
0.61 	 What do you think, why were not any American, British, French or Soviet defendants after the WWII?
0.68 	 war crimes?
0.76 	 The Germans had war crimes too, but in Nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration.
0.67 	 The main point was: Vae victis!
0.99 	 (That was also a book title in America, 1941.
0.94 	 Total darkness after 60 years!
0.98 	 And there are no American war criminals... Bravo, America!
0.98 	 Very clever.
0.59 	 So I don't have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films.
0.9 	 On a mass-appeal scale, it *could* have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" had it been adequately promoted in the US.
1.0 	 Put into an untenable position, she somehow manages to not only survive, but to grow -- and even flourish.<br /><br />If the story is lacking in any way, it's in the exposition.
0.97 	 But that would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or perhaps even more.
1.0 	 Because not one minute of the film is wasted, and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time.
0.66 	 Any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such.
0.99 	 Yes, I know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and sure, even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement,"Hey, lighten up, it's a kids movie," but all that aside, aren't they still good pieces of entertainment?
0.68 	 Black and White film.
0.72 	 Good photography.
0.97 	 Believable characters.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Just awful.<br /><br />I have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as "worthy" and "very good."
0.85 	 More could have been done with the main characters.
0.99 	 The recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material, and a $1.25 budget.
0.51 	 Serve cold in a big, plain stone cauldron.
0.55 	 Okay, now the MST3K episode.
0.79 	 I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well.
0.74 	 However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time around.
0.97 	 The trick with this episode is: listen carefully!
0.95 	 It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line.
0.81 	 Give it a second chance, and You'll see what I mean.
0.86 	 MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
0.86 	 In the future of 1985, a governmental committee headed by Howard Hesseman, is holding hearings on TV's first uncensored network.
0.93 	 They sample it's programming, that play as a series of skits.
0.79 	 I can name the good 'skit' movies on one hand, not using my thumb.
0.91 	 "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life", and "Mr. Mike's Mondo Video".
0.96 	 The reason for that is that this 'movie' is death in cinematic form.
0.51 	 None of the skits are even remotely funny, or even the least bit clever.
0.96 	 Howard could play any type, and a role like R. J. Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed.
0.86 	 Ironically in being so captivated by this slut, Philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee), and are more fit to be his mate.
0.91 	 That is why I find I never cared for his performance here - it lacks any reality.
0.76 	 As Mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch.<br /><br />Curiously her performance was not all of one note.
0.99 	 While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of the film, culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her, her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating, and her inability to keep any honest jobs.
0.64 	 In the end Howard does finally get his life in order, but Mildred ends a casualty (ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call).
0.75 	 The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 (leading to the largest write - in campaign in it's history, and a permanent change in it's rules), but Davis was established as a star.
0.66 	 Mirror.
0.85 	 Who knows?
0.71 	 I don't know, I guess I needed a hobby during my teen years.
1.0 	 A teenage outcast (Rainbow Harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror.
0.96 	 Soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her.
0.9 	 Movies like these, the power giver has a nasty side effect.
0.72 	 a few years back.
0.98 	 People love this movie foe some reason.
0.54 	 The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968.
0.87 	 The song "Who Will Buy?"
0.57 	 Most people miss Hollywood's point of concept.
0.81 	 Even thought I'm not the biggest of Cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement.
0.97 	 A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.<br /><br />Cher plays someone very un-Cher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family.
0.98 	 She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while, a nice mamma's boy man, and he asks her to marry him.
1.0 	 I loved her mom's questions: "Do you love him Loretta?
0.8 	 ", "Good.
0.99 	 If you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can.
1.0 	 ", "Oh yeah, he's a sweet man Ma".
0.83 	 When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years.<br /><br />This victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment.
0.87 	 Cerletti was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first Electroshock machine.
0.59 	 Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.<br /><br />This was,in so many ways, an anti-American movie.
0.99 	 It's about love, to be sure, but it's also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by American policies.
1.0 	 The characters, from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters.
1.0 	 It's a Cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan...<br /><br />Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses.
0.97 	 I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder.
0.94 	 I really did cry in the end (which I don't want to give away!)
1.0 	 The only bad cast member was the actress who played Anne Marie.
0.83 	 I say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like Anne Marie Fahey herself.
1.0 	 Most of Amazing Stories are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series...I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD's they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further diminishes this compilation.
0.98 	 A woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged Santa Claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment.
0.53 	 You can probably guess how Santa finally gets into the house.
0.9 	 This theory was presumably not intended to apply to, say, "Kind Hearts and Coronets" (which is, if anything, a satire on the Edwardian upper classes) or to "The Ladykillers" or "The Lavender Hill Mob", both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature.
0.98 	 The film's particular target is the rationing system.
0.71 	 During the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against Nazism, but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime.
0.66 	 It was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the Attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945, and organisations such as the British Housewives' League were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing.
0.97 	 I cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film's satire were the "spivs" (black marketeers), who play a relatively minor part in the action, or the Housewives' League, who do not appear at all.
0.98 	 (Indeed, I suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a TV sitcom rather than a film).
0.94 	 Global warming may have altered things slightly, but for many years part of being British was the ability to hold the belief, whatever statistics might say to the contrary, that Britain had an abnormally wet climate.
0.7 	 She starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol.
0.94 	 But that doesn't help to much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness.
0.95 	 I've just visited Russian forum of our TV-channel that had showed this film.
1.0 	 We wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film.
1.0 	 But authors had in mind something else... :( We are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here.
1.0 	 We are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand.
0.77 	 And where, the Hell our MIR station?
0.75 	 Ah?
0.85 	 I'm quite sure, that LUNOHOD events took place much earlier Armstrong's "walk on Moon".
0.89 	 Se our constructive critics in Russian forum on www.1tv.ru
0.75 	 Tobe Hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer.
0.92 	 Like any other horror fan, I loved the Texas Chainsaw, but I think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie.
0.65 	 Pure drudge.
0.57 	 Nothing in this film is redeemable.
0.94 	 I hope that he's able to pump out at least one more good flick, that way he can do his cult status some justice.<br /><br />
0.99 	 I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations.
0.65 	 I honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed.
0.52 	 funniest I've seen in a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and the chicks are hot too.
0.99 	 to him i say that u are not of Indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron.
0.98 	 don't rate movies u don't understand.
0.78 	 what did u watch, the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation?
1.0 	 thats what i thought jackass.
0.94 	 The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts.
0.95 	 No problem.
0.86 	 The cashier's life is mired in a harsh and frustrating "real world," while the actor is so enmeshed in his fantasy existence that he can't do simple tasks like remember phone numbers.
0.99 	 It's an odd little film, probably made on a shoestring.
1.0 	 If you don't mind slow pacing and a "talky" approach, this film will entertain.
0.57 	 Nothing redeeming here for even the most die-hard of horror fans!
0.86 	 People are showing up dead in the hallways, but still, class carries on as normal???
0.73 	 He is Bulldog Drummond (cleaned up in the Goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist) fighting crime.
0.97 	 When alone with Signe Hasso in her home, she at the top of a staircase and him at the base, they have an argument.
0.54 	 She demands that "Tony" leave, saying she won't see him.
0.96 	 He stares at her, his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before, and he says, "Oh, no you won't!"
0.73 	 But it is only that moment.
0.98 	 All three white actors did the role in black face.
0.92 	 Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set.
1.0 	 It seems a melodramatic, hackneyed idea.<br /><br />As a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with Cukor, Kanin, and Gordon.
0.88 	 There was an earlier movie in the 1930s, in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife (I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS, but I'm not sure).
0.88 	 But due to Colman's name and career, and Cukor's directing, it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea.
0.75 	 Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict, and can't delay the production long enough (she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play).
0.63 	 The man's brother is jailed on charges that he was an accomplice, but soon escapes.
0.99 	 Its strongest aspect was lead actress Emily Haack.
0.99 	 Setting aside the fact she's nude in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character.
0.99 	 First, and most noticeable, this film is very low budget and the film quality shows this.
0.78 	 The idea here was to deceive people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave".
0.7 	 And the themes are very loosely the same (a woman getting revenge on men).
0.51 	 Of course in 1959 we did not know about Mr. Hoover's obsession for keeping secret files on honest Americans, bugging people like the Rev.
0.8 	 Martin Luther King, Jr, but worst of all,his secret love affair with his deputy director,Clyde Tolson( If you want to know more about that subject, I suggest seeing the film Citizen Cohn).
0.65 	 But Jimmy is the movie.
0.59 	 Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot.
0.86 	 By today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating.
1.0 	 The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic.
1.0 	 You mean you really enjoyed it Theo ? "
0.5 	 Got that ?
0.67 	 (I had to walk MILES just to see a movie, and it was usually dark when I emerged from the theater; seeing a horror movie was always unnerving, but particularly so when it was as well-executed as this one.)
0.53 	 Take the terror test: watch it at night, alone, and THEN tell me it's not scary...
0.89 	 He has traveled to a small, rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play, as a manager of such a place.
0.9 	 He soon beguiles the staff and the customers, especially the lovely, if cranky, young woman (Paz Vega) who presides over the "10 items or less" checkout lane.<br /><br />10 Items Or Less doesn't have a big statement to make and doesn't pretend that it does.
0.56 	 I had a little case of the blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this flick cured what ailed me.
1.0 	 'Thunderbirds' was an immensely popular Sixties show that has transcended the years and generations to the point it is still as popular now, with both adults and children alike, as it was in its heyday.
0.99 	 So, one would deduce the chance to produce a live-action feature film with a million pound Hollywood budget was an excellent opportunity to revive the series as has been done with 'Spider-Man' and 'The X-Men'.
0.87 	 The scriptwriter seemed more interested in ripping off 'Spy Kids' (which was at least quirky and original) instead of remaking the show people know and love.<br /><br />Although Sophia Myles and Ron Cook were excellent as Miss Penelope and Parker, they only had about three lines between them so their presence was barely felt.
1.0 	 Ironically, it is young Soren Fulton's Fermat who is the only interesting character of the film as Fulton delivers a natural and relaxed performance.<br /><br />'Thunderbirds' the series will be forever remembered as an excellent show that proves puppets can give solid performances!
0.89 	 I've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and, admit it, you do too!
1.0 	 There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere.
0.95 	 Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't.
0.84 	 It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film.
0.97 	 I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again.
0.76 	 What can be better?
0.67 	 Somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff.
0.74 	 The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on.
0.95 	 <br /><br />You mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot.
0.69 	 I have to admit I've caught this one a few times on the USA Network.
0.66 	 But I can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors.
0.7 	 It's such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that I have a whole lot of respect for this film.
0.97 	 Is it low budget?
0.7 	 yes.
0.91 	 Can you tell that it's low budget?
0.86 	 Yes...but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesn't matter.
0.99 	 I don't know what's up with all these bad reviews for this film.
1.0 	 All I hear is "worst movie ever".
1.0 	 Have these idiots seen EVERY movie out there?
0.98 	 There's thousands of movies out there, how can you categorize one as the "worst" ever?
1.0 	 A video not "movie" like "zombiez" may be the worst film I ever SEEN but I can't say that it's the worst movie EVER since I haven't seen every movie out there.
0.99 	 Bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs.
0.9 	 knowing that you don't like this type of stuff?
0.9 	 I don't like TV shows like Dawson's Creek or the O.C., THEY SUCK to me.
0.83 	 Why?
0.83 	 Because I can't relate to them.
0.95 	 Believe me, I will never watch GARDEN STATE 2: GARDEN SALAD, WEDDING CRASHERS 2: Here's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and I HEART HUCKABORING.
0.8 	 Anywho, I liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet I'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!
0.81 	 I'm out.
0.86 	 THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007)<br /><br />Number 1 - Television Show of all Time <br /><br />Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.98 	 This is no shallow, dull show about tough guys and violence.
0.56 	 <br /><br />Simply exceptional.<br /><br />10/10
0.97 	 This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives.<br /><br />I thought "The Walker" would be thrilling and engaging, but I was so wrong.
0.59 	 At points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel for the characters whose mistakes and failures you watch.
0.9 	 Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the film where the runners get tired.
0.81 	 All of the runners get to this point where they think that have something back they lost or are on track again.
0.97 	 His characters fail (do they at the end?)
0.71 	 Idiotic hack crooks, a babe, a safe, a plan and a baby.
0.86 	 <br /><br />Even with some a-list star power (at least a-minus...okay, b-plus?)
0.88 	 These are low-life bad guys.
0.98 	 They speak low-life bad guy language and they do low-life bad guy things.
0.99 	 It seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa.
0.64 	 dear god.
0.76 	 unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters.
0.97 	 you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Ye Be Warned.<br /><br />I recommend not watching this.<br /><br />hello.<br /><br />how are you?<br /><br />I'm pretty good.<br /><br />enjoying this day?<br /><br />I am.<br /><br />this comment was one-hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie.
0.58 	 this is sad.
0.76 	 We meet him going out for the evening, claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by 30 is "a blackguard", he, at 34, is now "on borrowed time"!
0.56 	 Unfortunately, it also results in losing his commission... Further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the British, and sent to a POW camp in a Scottish castle.<br /><br />While carving toys and boxes, Jacques catches the attention of Flora, the young niece of Miss Susan Gilchrist, a well-travelled woman of the world who lives at Swanston Cottage.
0.97 	 Of course, there is a problem.
0.77 	 !<br /><br />My main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes.
1.0 	 While this would not be implausible with more down-market characters "making do", it seems odd for well-to-do ladies such as the heroines to be wearing 1780s gowns in 1813.
0.9 	 As a whole, 'St.
0.82 	 The Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials.
0.98 	 Except for the Brady Variety Hour, this was some of the hokiest television I've seen in a while.
0.65 	 And Marie Osmond looks like she did battle with the Avon Lady.. and lost big time.
0.96 	 Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavillion in World Showcase that would be opening 'in about a year.
0.76 	 All in all though, for all the shortcomings, this still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.
0.96 	 scene, it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part, and even though the TV version of The Shining from 1997 isn't bad the Torrance character is indelibly linked to the One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest star.
0.7 	 Christopher Walken's role is such a throw-away, what a tease!
0.95 	 I'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be.
0.53 	 All of those things were done to the "non-stars" -never mind that the movies wouldn't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience.
0.88 	 It's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches.
0.95 	 Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again?
0.73 	 I mean hello!
0.84 	 Wrong.<br /><br />Reason 3: One word - ClichÃ©<br /><br />Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal.
0.72 	 Want to see a miracle soon?
1.0 	 God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety.
0.83 	 Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?<br /><br />In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.
0.53 	 Not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10.
0.91 	 The supporting cast is nearly dead center.
0.8 	 Counting the minor flaws in the movie: Ellen Barkin's make-up gave her face has a washed out look; there were a couple of gimme cameos by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor that served no purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's screen time was too short.
0.97 	 The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death.
1.0 	 As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race.
0.56 	 Cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews.
0.95 	 Some of you, suppose, won't like it.
0.85 	 Sorta makes me wish I could play God and strike everyone involved in making this film with several bolts of lightning.
0.7 	 ", "You son-of-a-witch!
0.66 	 "<br /><br />O.K.
0.66 	 Bye.<br /><br />P.S.
0.59 	 One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking "Wow this this over already?"
0.71 	 I do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton, and of course: organs.<br /><br /> In the same stream, you'll find: "Il Ã©tait une fois l'homme" which relate the human History from the big bang to the 20th century.
0.95 	 Or so it seems.
1.0 	 How can anyone think this is a classic?
0.98 	 The producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several movies that were way above her acting ability.
0.78 	 I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitch's future movies were going to be.
0.94 	 Cybil Shepard's career took a dive after being in several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced.
0.72 	 It wasn't until "Moonlighting" that her career started to come back.
0.88 	 The only place I have watched it was overseas in Europe late at night.
0.53 	 The scenes and costumes are lavish, and the acting is very well-done, which isn't surprising, considering the cast.
0.61 	 Christopher Walken is very catlike, and doesn't need stupid make-up, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human.
0.6 	 And it actually IS a movie you can watch together, as it won't drive adults up the wall.
0.95 	 Reality is not one of its strong points.
0.93 	 Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles.
0.94 	 But that is the trouble with premium services, the subscription variety.
0.97 	 This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers, eating pizza, and laugh at.
0.85 	 He does very little heroic things in the movie.
0.88 	 He has less redeeming qualities than the villains do.
0.68 	 If there's one genre that I've never been a fan of, it's the biopic.
0.87 	 Always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right.
0.99 	 Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different.
0.92 	 Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part.
0.74 	 I never doubted Mol could handle the part since, but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago.
0.84 	 The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story.
1.0 	 This one is fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
0.9 	 When I read about Kay Pollak, I was hooked.
0.99 	 So isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt?
0.99 	 Tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls.
1.0 	 So start living NOW.<br /><br />Many people are criticizing this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws.
0.95 	 Get a grip folks, it's a parable, a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty.<br /><br />So join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you.
0.94 	 Writing a check is not enough.
0.94 	 Any one who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead.
0.98 	 What surprised me or startled me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate "And don't ever forget, that you are a Jew!"
0.73 	 Though that may have not been a racist remark,Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was hulking, comparing with his previous performances in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David".
0.96 	 It's a film that shouldn't work, yet does.
0.98 	 Cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for Natali (at $7.5million!
0.98 	 so with Nothing he scales down again.
0.72 	 Simple, good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to Hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain.
0.95 	 Nothing is a film about Nothing and before you ask, no it is not anything like Seinfeld!
0.89 	 Basically Andrew and Dave are a couple of losers.
0.66 	 They live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways.
0.75 	 By bizarre mis-fortunes however, Dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from Daves work-place incriminating Dave, and Andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout (Canadian humour people!).
0.96 	 They are desperate and can't escape, and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white.
0.99 	 No police, no demolition team, no angry girl scout mother!
0.88 	 They are left alone.
0.56 	 The house is surrounded by nothing, which is portrayed as pure white.
0.89 	 Certainly I expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as Cypher did and it should appear on DVD in a year or two in the states.
1.0 	 I prey to god he doesn't do the proposed Necropolis, written and directed by ADD sufferer, the ever crap Paul Anderson.
0.56 	 ****
0.89 	 You eithier like Michael Jackson or you don't, but if you like him then you have to see this movie.
0.92 	 The only minor thing I subjectively object to, is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story.
1.0 	 The hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at Michael Douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass.
0.99 	 The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?
0.87 	 Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth.
1.0 	 He's set on protecting the treasure.
0.98 	 your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade.
0.98 	 First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah Â brilliant idea!).
1.0 	 Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune.
1.0 	 It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger).
0.92 	 She thinks Ben is clearly a nut Â at least at the beginning.
1.0 	 But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, "is that the Hope Diamond?"
0.98 	 The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive.
0.64 	 In the final analysis, "National Treasure" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of.
1.0 	 The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites.
0.9 	 The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements.
1.0 	 The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism.
0.93 	 If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick.
0.68 	 Branaugh is one heck of an actor.
0.95 	 I recommend this to anyone both fan of Shakespeare and those not so much.
0.57 	 Not to knock Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole work.
0.99 	 This leaves no stone unturned.
0.88 	 Um how you say "two thumbs up".
0.96 	 They meet by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday.
1.0 	 The pair fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part.
1.0 	 Coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love.
0.97 	 Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people'.
0.65 	 Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt.
0.93 	 Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous.
0.52 	 In typical S.C style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances.
0.89 	 This is the sort of film that Jess Franco would crank out in the 70s (although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales) and fans of that madman's work would be wise to give this one a go.<br /><br />To me, as a long time zero budget cinema fan (and Troma worshiper), I came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films (Playmate of the apes, Who wants to be a erotic billionaire) but I actually prefer their more original works.
0.99 	 You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films.
0.75 	 I do recommend you pass on the disc's bonus feature, the first film by director, as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing.
0.93 	 The US needs to set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country?
0.99 	 The way to gain access, the US concludes, is to win an obstacle course like cross-country race, where the winner can ask anything of the leader.
0.81 	 And who better to win this race known as the "Game" than a gymnast?
0.69 	 Of course!
1.0 	 A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission.
0.84 	 Lucky for our hero, there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots, like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square (for no reason) amidst crazy town.
1.0 	 After winning the race, our hero puts forth the wishes of the US government.
0.99 	 And lo and behold, all the effort was worth it, because the US gets its "Star Wars" site!
0.92 	 Huzzah!
0.95 	 THIS IS YOUR TRIUMPHANT ENDING?!
0.71 	 Wow.<br /><br />But still, being such a bad movie, it can be great fun to watch.
0.89 	 The cover alone, depicting ninjas with machine guns, was enough to get me to rent this film.<br /><br />But if I were ever to meet Kurt Thomas (the gymnast-star) in real life, I would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.
1.0 	 It is a good film for kids who love dogs.
0.92 	 It is the comedy that the film needed more of.
0.63 	 See it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
0.67 	 "Saturday The 12th", a?...
0.98 	 Great Work...
0.8 	 I Laughed Every Minute of the movie...
0.75 	 But You Can Still Watch It on FLIX...
0.83 	 Why?
0.99 	 Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout.
0.69 	 Gimme a break.
1.0 	 Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently lovely Canadian lass.
0.91 	 This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.
0.86 	 Not so.
0.93 	 For example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before Irene and her man of destiny meet again.
0.51 	 You know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky.
0.8 	 In fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller, and only lawyer Chamberlain has the answer.
0.95 	 Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason.
0.76 	 Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court.
0.75 	 After all, it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key (I believe) to the riddle, yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation.
0.62 	 A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family, leaving them in the historical dust.
0.77 	 The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells.
0.99 	 ",in his clouded judgment, tells her where they are.She might just as well have asked,"Enos,is this a good movie?
0.96 	 I've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student, the majority the normal waste of time that US television throws out.
0.96 	 I always wonder if it will not be quite the same but I am never disappointed in it.
0.57 	 There is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off.
0.51 	 While they make love, didn't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head?
0.66 	 Why did they do in a living room?
0.95 	 How about the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene at Grant Lake.
0.59 	 I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview.
0.93 	 It could easily passed over as Baby Geniuses.<br /><br />If any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash.
0.55 	 When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc?
0.57 	 MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick.
0.5 	 I actually sent Mike Ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed.
0.99 	 System says I need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff.
0.89 	 They talked for about an hour afterwords.
0.96 	 Not really a dry eye in the house.
1.0 	 Why Hollywood continues to be stupid I do not know.
0.96 	 ( actually I do know , it is our fault, look what we watch)Well you get what you pay for guys.
0.99 	 I do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression.
0.87 	 They cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them.
0.99 	 This scene is possibly meant to be funny, but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film.
0.51 	 And to say the least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring.
0.99 	 Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent.
0.79 	 Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find Joe a job which results in stealing food.
0.87 	 They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party.
0.94 	 As a previous reviewer commented, I have no idea how this film has found itself in IMDBs bottom 100 list!
1.0 	 That's absolutely ridiculous!
0.97 	 (And, even if you're not the crying type, you might get a little weepy-eyed before the credits roll.)
1.0 	 ), but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and/or characters who lack substance.
0.99 	 i love horror films, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's.. but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film?
0.87 	 let's compare it to titles in a similar vein- haunted house films.
0.98 	 the haunting, the changeling, the shining.
1.0 	 or for a similar technology based horror film that was FAAAR better, (though still FAR from great) Demon Seed.
0.78 	 OK, i'll be fair.. let's compare it to made-for-TV horror films!
0.97 	 the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers!
1.0 	 also, just what we understand about the house.. it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on, and it's a very emotional house.
0.86 	 we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie/margaret, our protagonist?
0.9 	 no, she stands there and watches!
0.65 	 the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film, but that's where the positives end.
0.95 	 for at least a more interesting, and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed: the bed that eats.
0.95 	 i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired, or remembered it scaring them as children.
0.92 	 Its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the TV horror movie.
0.76 	 Recommended for all fans of the 70's TV movie much like trilogy of terror.
1.0 	 I won't comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but here it feels like a soap opera.
0.65 	 To start with, the acting, except for Eric Bana, is soap opera quality.
0.98 	 How it lingers on him when he's thinking, it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab!
0.7 	 Either way, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans!
0.68 	 And to end my comments, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she sure is no Helen of Troy.
0.87 	 No one seems to be grounded in the real world.
0.9 	 If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them.
1.0 	 The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year.
0.92 	 Henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares.
0.99 	 True, the actors don't "act" ...
0.73 	 Not being a fan of first person shooters I was very hesitant to play this game.
0.66 	 You have this green amulet,called the "Gel'ziabar Stone" that has special powers and warns you of particular events or things to look at.
0.8 	 Walking in a hallway you suddenly hear the magical stone whisper:" Look",with the stone glowing at for example a painting.
0.93 	 And then using the scrye spell you can see some weird and creepy stuff on the painting.
0.51 	 Let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell.
0.95 	 But sadly I have to report that there are some flaws.
0.87 	 But with all the loading times and some difficult enemies in between that can become frustrating.
0.97 	 And there is no map.
1.0 	 But in first person mode that can be an annoying task.
0.68 	 Luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace.
0.93 	 Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn't have much to do.
0.68 	 ***1/2 out of 5
0.87 	 This movie was worth five punches on my "hurter card".
0.72 	 I saw this while stationed in Virginia in the mid '70's.
0.99 	 I offer you this: if it was so awesome what was it's box office take?
0.83 	 There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching) which showed the Vangard launch attempt, which failed.<br /><br />He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr.
0.86 	 The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center.<br /><br />The army rushed the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a US made V2 technology, but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik.<br /><br />This error may have actually been made by Homer, because of the notoriety of Von Braun, but his team didn't have their attempt fail.
0.88 	 The nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker, but I doubt he's ever played above 3-6.
0.67 	 The actors to watch in this movie are Queen Momma, Scotty Nguyen, and the loser who can never win at poker.
0.99 	 Also the nameless Arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them.
1.0 	 Their subtle performances are easily among the film's highlights.
0.69 	 Plan 9 from Outer Space has slightly more coherency.
0.95 	 If you play poker though you might want to have a laugh.
0.99 	 They must be envious of Johnny Chan for getting in Rounders.
0.91 	 I must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for Dani in the end.
0.99 	 it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly.
0.79 	 watching him die made me cry for a whole day.
0.91 	 i just could not believe it.
0.94 	 they really can make it through anything.
0.76 	 I got the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump," "The Wonder Years," and Oliver Stone's 60s films over and over again and called it research.
0.55 	 He was right.
0.55 	 The first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'.
0.99 	 The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't.
0.99 	 While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film.
0.59 	 The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere.
0.91 	 The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films.
0.68 	 He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way.
1.0 	 Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out.<br /><br />I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people.
0.83 	 Unfortunately, there is zero character development, so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters.
0.75 	 A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a Maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and, after a l-o-o-o-ng hike, an ancient Indian burial ground.
0.6 	 But there are far better ones, too (such as "Salem's Lot," "The Dead Zone," and both versions of "The Shining").
0.83 	 It does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little Britain) for it to be funny.
0.98 	 I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to watch it until last night.
0.94 	 I do like Juliette Lewis although I'm indifferent to Brad Pitt.
0.75 	 After this viewing I have to admit he's a perfectly fine actor - his character was entirely believable, and I didn't think "Brad Pitt" at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't say the same for David Duchovny.
0.86 	 I'm an X-Files fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I'd thought it was made a few years later.
0.78 	 Why haven't I noticed her before?
0.58 	 (I'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap) I am slightly concerned about stereotyping re Lewis, this film, and "Natural Born Killers" (a firm favourite).
0.91 	 Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department.
0.77 	 Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard.
0.56 	 We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also.
0.52 	 Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day.
0.81 	 Crazy.
0.99 	 Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go.
0.56 	 i didn't like Josh he was a tw*t, i preferred Harvey but then he disappeared.
0.96 	 and they got rid of Libby!
0.85 	 i didn't like theses people either, it didn't really seem they liked Sabrina.
0.98 	 Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into they're own stupid story lines.
0.88 	 i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re-runs were back and i was like whoo-hoo!
0.72 	 LOL.
0.87 	 i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible.they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show.
0.66 	 the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster.
0.66 	 it had the aunts in it (Zelda was reduced to a candle) and she's about to get married but she runs off with Harvey the end.
0.74 	 In an attempt to rescue Ashraf from his fate, Noam and Lulu disguise themselves as French reporters to gain access to Ashraf.
0.99 	 In Hebrew, Arabic, and English with subtitles.
0.82 	 What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that.
0.99 	 Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this one.<br /><br />His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face.
0.78 	 Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character, who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film, only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham's character.<br /><br />Before anyone starts to say I'm missing the point...
1.0 	 Opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace.
0.96 	 Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction.
0.54 	 Myself?
0.88 	 I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently.
0.62 	 Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown.
0.89 	 Apparently this was shot in Fiji.
0.81 	 Nice work if you can get it.
0.97 	 Reminds me of all those low-budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.

0.96 	 I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them.
0.77 	 I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.<br /><br />I was a youngster at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on.

0.97 	 Gram's father had long since been dead in 1973, the other global characters are fictional, none of this has anything to do with Grams life or death.<br /><br />If you are a Gram fan, I advise you to not see this movie.

0.94 	 In fact, many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for Pink Floyd's The Wall.<br /><br />One should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing, and the cemented date of this film aside, there are a few flaws which others have overlooked.
1.0 	 Lindsay Anderson was known to be a fan of Luis BuÃ±uel, on top of generally being too smart for his own good.
0.89 	 Anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over-intelligent cynicism, failing to see that BuÃ±uel was jovial in his work.
0.92 	 I have not found a critic whom champions the 'Chaplain in a drawer', and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film.

0.98 	 And if he can't get to Satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.<br /><br />That's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: It's not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality.
0.56 	 (If you want to know how, see the film!)
0.89 	 Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell.
0.91 	 Next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre.
0.8 	 And unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in.
0.84 	 A lot of Italian directors were especially interested, such as Lucio Fulci who brought us 'Zombie' a year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', known as 'Zombi' in Italy and some other countries, and it was there that Fulci's film was known as 'Zombi 2'.
0.75 	 Apart from the walking dead it has no relation to Romero's film, but is a good film in it's own right.
1.0 	 It was a big success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born.<br /><br />Pros: Lots of beautiful, lush scenery.

0.72 	 Anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, must have seen a film or two by American International Pictures, a distributor that resembled 1980s giant Cannon Films.
0.99 	 '<br /><br />'Dillinger,' released in 1973, is one of the more 'highbrow' AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making; it is one of those uneven, over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses' thirst for entertainment, craftsmanship and common sense be damned.
1.0 	 On the whole, 'Dillinger' is typical for its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable.
0.99 	 Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact, 'Dillinger' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director John Milius ('Magnum Force') but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career.<br /><br />The 109-minute 'Dillinger' - epic for AIP's scope - follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis, played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson.
0.85 	 Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice.
1.0 	 Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson, taking along Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pierpont (Geoffrey Lewis).
0.85 	 While taking place over several months in 1933-4, 'Dillinger' is basically a chase film, with Purvis's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />'Dillinger' has a documentary feel, listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis.
1.0 	 Milius keeps an honest Depression look, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons, and buildings; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts.
0.99 	 The action scenes are Dillinger's strongpoint, edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort.
1.0 	 The action scenes (mostly blood-filled shootouts) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era, including 1967's 'Bonnie and Clyde.'
0.88 	 But we simply don't get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people; the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon, with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward.
0.68 	 Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline, becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling.
0.63 	 Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die, as Milius's screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe.
0.79 	 In fact, Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow.
1.0 	 Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the American press; however, we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime.
0.99 	 Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis, suave but rather flat.
0.85 	 Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it's really too bad that Milius's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with Dillinger.
0.95 	 We never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer, other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger.
0.99 	 The film is nicely presented in widescreen (a must for drive-in flicks) with subtitles in French and Spanish.
0.83 	 Dillinger's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra.
0.99 	 For fans of the genre, it's certainly worth checking out.<br /><br />** out of 4<br /><br />Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
1.0 	 Mike Hawthorne(Gordon Currie)is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father Morty(Jon Fedele).
1.0 	 Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends to his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party.
1.0 	 It is soon discovered that Morty's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin.
0.74 	 The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins.<br /><br />Most of the F/X are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme.
1.0 	 Cast members of note are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
0.73 	 When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising.
0.83 	 Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and Sookie presented herself as an independent woman.
0.99 	 However, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box.<br /><br />As the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities.
1.0 	 All these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity.
0.74 	 Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show.
0.66 	 His actions are never really explained except he does it for Sookie.
1.0 	 Their love for each other is never delved into, if there is any love.
0.51 	 All the events that happen are usually left unexplained.
0.86 	 Tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters.
0.81 	 The only reason why I continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters.
0.97 	 I feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk.
0.86 	 Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens.
0.96 	 Watch the wonderful human portrayal in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where the illnesses are believable and real.

0.96 	 These are too smart and calculating to make them come to life.

0.99 	 in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons.
0.94 	 its not violent or horror, but it has the best depiction of sasquatch.
0.73 	 only see this movie if you are desperate, or really appreciate anyone in the film.
0.85 	 There is no real drama.
0.9 	 Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do.
0.98 	 In fact Prancer was the best actor in this movie.
0.99 	 Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper.
0.94 	 Too bad it ended before it begun.
0.9 	 IÂ´ve waited 21 years for a sequel, but nooooo!!
1.0 	 A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a great idea.
0.62 	 Ask the dust.<br /><br />This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters.
0.61 	 No one is given a proper back story, so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do.<br /><br />Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have one left at the end of this movie.<br /><br />I told a friend that I went to see this film, and that I thought it was awful.<br /><br />Her question: "Not even Colin Farrell could save it?"
0.97 	 The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist').
0.64 	 However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta:The werewolf Hunt.
0.98 	 On the surface, it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface, what lies is a not-so-positive message about rape.
0.93 	 She needs a MAN to help her.
0.75 	 When the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her, she does not stand up for herself.
1.0 	 What would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way.
0.94 	 The director is famous for being chauvinistic.
0.9 	 Though it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light, what he does not show us is whether Ash's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing.
1.0 	 The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release.
0.8 	 It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues.
0.98 	 In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT).
0.99 	 The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE.
0.69 	 Some of it is good, some of it isn't.
0.53 	 A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef).
0.62 	 Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture "Witch Light," and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission.
1.0 	 Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks.
0.71 	 Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time).
0.72 	 "<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here?
0.87 	 From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects.
1.0 	 The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice.
1.0 	 Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch.
0.54 	 In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met nice and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli).
0.89 	 After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan only few minutes before their wedding.
0.98 	 Billy Crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter, but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face.... or perhaps just one.

0.85 	 This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of Marlon Wayan onto the body of a two foot-high dwarf.
1.0 	 Repeatedly hitting Darryl in the crotch enables Calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that both he and Darryl have always wished for.
0.53 	 <br /><br />In this movie the Wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichÃ©d sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent body of work.
0.83 	 To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS.

0.52 	 It was so conspicuous, their absence from the Reunion show, that I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia herself (if still alive) either, 1) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) TNN could not find any trace of either Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have vanished.
0.83 	 I remember, as a child, mimicking Grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing (as I'm sure a million other children did back then).

0.94 	 I know I'm in the minority, but...<br /><br />Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog.
0.7 	 Slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things (like his failed relationship) on his mind.

0.9 	 We all know that killers like Freddy, Jason, Michael and even Leatherface shouldn't be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day.
0.96 	 Most of us don't believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains.
0.93 	 This usually isn't a problem when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C. Scott or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near Burketsville.
1.0 	 But what I do have a problem digesting ( without wanting to regurgitate ) is when a film has a killer like the one in this film.
0.74 	 There are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is.
0.67 	 If the film would have offered me a different killer, then I would actually be raving about it.
1.0 	 This may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film, but believe me, anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me.<br /><br />John Cassevetes plays Dr. Sam Cordell.
0.66 	 We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman ( one can only presume it is his wife ) is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour.
0.83 	 Again, I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway.
0.52 	 Cassevetes, it has to be mentioned, is strange to say the least.
0.68 	 There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities.
0.98 	 It never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent, but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug.
0.98 	 But he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene.
1.0 	 He just has that slimy, disingenuous, phlegmatic, uneasy way about him.
0.86 	 He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film.
0.88 	 I guess that is a credit to the writers, the director and to Cassevetes himself.
0.71 	 There was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get-go.
0.86 	 There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see, something or someone is watching them.
0.92 	 When the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck, the young woman wanders into the shed, just to play a prank.
0.84 	 Once she is there, she is attacked.
0.7 	 The young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail.
0.8 	 He looks frantically scours the room and spots his would-be lover bleeding in the corner, and then smacko, the guy gets it.
0.85 	 Toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother, a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen.<br /><br />Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time, the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped.
1.0 	 This is my first feeble (and careful) attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement.
0.89 	 <br /><br />7 out of 10-- This could have been a nine.
0.99 	 Too bad.
0.55 	 Lexi's parents have just split up.
0.86 	 Lexi is admitted to hospital.
0.7 	 She is diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa, and is made to gain weight.
0.82 	 This leads to the two falling out, as Lexi's mum tells Jen's mum her suspicions.<br /><br />At a party Jen is hit by a car, and because her heart is weak it kills her.
0.99 	 I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly.
1.0 	 Wynona and Antonio's characters could have been developed a lot more and their romance could have been much more passionate.
0.98 	 And what was with Meryl's character and her "mystical powers"?
0.99 	 Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism.
0.92 	 The animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of George Orwell's novel is sorely missing.<br /><br />If you're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch.
0.58 	 Just one man's opinion however.<br /><br />The remake is a notch below but not by much.
0.6 	 This is a bizzare look at Al's "life", back when he still a hyper 20-something.
1.0 	 The writer, David Ward, wrote the amazing caper film "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had just done excellent work in films like "Klute," "Start the Revolution Without Me," and "Kelly's Heroes."
0.99 	 At the same time the movie wants to be hip satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the NBC television show "Saturday Night" would do so well two years later.
0.86 	 It is as terrible a performance as her performance in "Klute" was terrific.
0.72 	 You had a few special agents, and it had a "clandestine" kind of feel to it.
0.59 	 A lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second, and didn't really add any originality to the MIB Universe.<br /><br />A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 films.
1.0 	 I borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful.
0.81 	 "Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but Europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines".
0.66 	 --- It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book.
0.71 	 Fifty seconds.
0.53 	 One world ends, another begins.<br /><br />How can it not be given a ten?
0.84 	 It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE (from 1963) look like a masterpiece.<br /><br />The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place.
0.85 	 They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus.
0.67 	 They meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call "Uni" which they bring back to Earth with them.
0.99 	 "Uni" speaks like an average, pleasant person - 'Oh, hello.
0.75 	 How are you?
0.99 	 Lovely planet here.
0.65 	 Hope you like it.'
0.95 	 The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over.<br /><br />High point of the film - the end where the Stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey.
0.77 	 The Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies.
0.87 	 Brutal.<br /><br />Another writer mentioned the fine musical score.
0.51 	 Huh?
1.0 	 The only music I even noticed were two classic tunes - I'LL TAKE ROMANCE and THERE GOES THAT SONG AGAIN, both of which are played at the party.
0.99 	 This is just a butchering of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres.
1.0 	 Here, Carlito retires with his woman in paradise.
0.72 	 I think he was in the first book.<br /><br />I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a totally different character in this film.
0.8 	 He was Pachanga back in the Pacino days.
0.96 	 Now, he is Nacho Reyes, a killer from Cuba.
0.53 	 I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book.
1.0 	 But, magically the Pleasant Avenue bunch is around for the second movie.<br /><br />The book told a great story.
0.97 	 This movie could have told a great story.
0.83 	 Read the book.
0.99 	 The characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series.
0.85 	 The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing.
0.64 	 They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening.
0.91 	 Then there's some running around, terminating in a real pie-fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand-grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them.
0.58 	 Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater, but god-awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut.
0.95 	 This scores 2 out of 10 at most, on a good day.
1.0 	 Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody.
1.0 	 Happily, I couldn't have been more wrong.
0.79 	 Judging from the laughter and guffaws, the audience ate up Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years.
0.93 	 I was not ready, perhaps.
0.75 	 But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years.<br /><br />Do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players.
0.54 	 This was the Modesty that we didn't know!
0.92 	 The "purists" should also note that we really don't know if everything she told Miklos was true because she was "stalling for time."
0.98 	 I didn't rent or borrow the DVD like other "reviewers" did, I bought it!
0.98 	 And I don't want a refund!
0.96 	 I watched it three times and I didn't sleep through it!
0.92 	 You might notice in a great number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer which meant Connery himself raised the money since he is a major player .
0.58 	 Likely ?
0.67 	 The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz.
0.79 	 From a purely technical point of view though, the film was alright: the sets, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience; although the above mentioned GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES let it down a bit.<br /><br />I wonder how the director/co-writer AgnÃ¨s Merlet defended her film at the time?
0.88 	 Trust me, you'll regret it!
1.0 	 First of all i'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels.
0.94 	 It has all of the classic elements of a late 80's/early 90's action film....the random gratuitous acts of violence (ie.
0.59 	 when Walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money), the snapping of necks, the guys on fire, the guys that get blown off buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings.
0.72 	 and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store.
0.93 	 if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
0.55 	 People don't adore her!
0.73 	 Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is "baby face".
0.57 	 It is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.<br /><br />Here, our characters are completely different: the bride is in love with Harris.
0.89 	 Harris is the son of the housekeeper.
0.96 	 Buddy is a drunk, in love with Ann and/or Harris.
0.59 	 Skip it.
0.62 	 The movie had me laughing from start to finish.
0.86 	 Although a lot of the content is stereotypical, I didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled, and it even has a good ending.
0.86 	 I know I may be wrong about some things, but it seemed like the 60's really had an effect on people of the time.
0.66 	 Some people said they would want to go back to the 60's.
0.66 	 <br /><br />
0.6 	 This is the epitome of a good thing gone bad.
0.99 	 Okay, there is still some enjoyment to be had, but only in the most mundane sense.
0.88 	 And you get to KEEP them!
0.93 	 Now, don't you feel special!?
0.98 	 All the beautiful artistry that went into his "look" in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper, less detailed set of prosthetics.
0.62 	 But it mattered to me.
0.81 	 <br /><br />It's more...a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one-liners and clever repartee (sadly, it fell short on both accounts).
0.57 	 <br /><br />It rates a 3.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
0.96 	 I can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most "normal" people.
0.97 	 - A small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money.
0.92 	 His friend may be good with a gun, but he's up against a group of trained killers.
0.97 	 There's also a sub-plot about how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there's little made of it and it doesn't help the movie any at all.<br /><br />- The mob boss, Mister Scarface, is played by Jack Palance.
0.65 	 That's Charlie Hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic Ben Turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber.<br /><br />One of the film's script writers was silent comedian Harry Langdon.<br /><br />Stan & Ollie are the main focus, however.
0.66 	 Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members.
0.5 	 The society is suffering from corruption.
0.82 	 The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene.
0.52 	 europe!
0.68 	 I'm not a religious, so I couldn't care less really but film-making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance.
0.98 	 Seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up.
0.91 	 I just couldn't cared less really at times.<br /><br />Still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end, when its story gets more focused on its essence.
0.98 	 Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town.
0.76 	 So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go.
0.91 	 The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety.
0.6 	 I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat.
0.7 	 Director Juan Piquer SimÃ³n is more widely known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K deservedly mocked) and "Peices" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) <br /><br />Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A <br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie
0.94 	 I can't wait to hear all of the deleted songs!
0.96 	 What about the cute mice too!
0.95 	 And that's about all, except for a completely out-of-place "love theme" that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story.
1.0 	 At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely (in a two dimensional role) but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery.
0.79 	 Mercifully, I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately.
0.79 	 "Danger, Will Robinson!"
0.68 	 See the current t.v.
0.91 	 commercial showing a husband and wife whale-watching ("Orca - I love Orca...") - at least it is over in sixty seconds.
0.99 	 Twist endings can be really cool in a movie.
0.85 	 It's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention.
0.93 	 Those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think.
0.88 	 Then we've got twists like this film has.
0.84 	 They end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson).
0.9 	 Did he have a one seater?
0.99 	 It's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely out there, but undoubtedly dumb.<br /><br />My rating: * 1/2 out of ****.
0.99 	 But it is nice to see Denzel W. prevail over the Man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt.
0.91 	 Von Trapp.
1.0 	 There is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice.
0.96 	 I can appreciate what Barney is trying to achieve, but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house, I couldn't help but think...when is this gonna end?
0.93 	 That said, experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments.
0.83 	 The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening.
0.94 	 If this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely LOVE it!
0.99 	 This is the very definition of an art film.
0.76 	 You get from it what you take from it.
0.54 	 I'm glad that there is a place for films such as this, but I can't say I would want to sit through it again.
0.92 	 I think, perhaps now that I know what to expect I might enjoy something like this more.
0.91 	 Like I say, buried very deep.
1.0 	 One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations.
0.89 	 Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?)
0.83 	 Not one of the better responses to said challenge.
0.72 	 The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba the (apparently self-appointed) "Queen of the Werewolves".
0.99 	 As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie.
0.87 	 The end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube.
0.75 	 Check them out to see why and remember, the whole film makes about the same amount of sense.
0.5 	 It's definitely up there in standards surpassing Bored of the Rings, and on par with movies like Harry Potter.
0.95 	 Well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems.
0.87 	 Being a self confessed horror fan I sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect.
0.98 	 The film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story.
0.57 	 (48 out of 278 people found this comment useful, and counting...)<br /><br />People are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow "idealism" that lurks behind Communism.
0.94 	 By "them" I'm referring, of course, to Left-wing Hollywood and its "secret" love of Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro... take your pick).
0.94 	 I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project.
0.98 	 Where was Oliver Stone all these years?
0.91 	 Robert Redford?
0.64 	 Tim Robbins?
0.6 	 Warren Beatty?
0.82 	 Alan Pakula?
0.89 	 It's a mystery.
0.82 	 All these overrated "artists" have often indulging themselves in similar, politically one-sided projects, yet somehow Che Guevara, who is arguably the most popular and well-known Communist, hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet.<br /><br />"Guerrilla" has all the hallmarks of an American truth-bending story of an epic scale; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood big-budget political fairy-tale bios such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", i.e.
1.0 	 The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary.
0.98 	 Nevertheless, however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been, one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually.
0.96 	 Del Toro may be an interesting, charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically, but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever, hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive.
1.0 	 Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh, who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career, would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task.
0.77 	 (Psychopaths don't have ideals.)
1.0 	 I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che's earlier life.
0.97 	 Amazing.
0.95 	 It seems mankind will never learn.
0.95 	 <br /><br />The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote.
0.63 	 Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion.
0.56 	 I know I should like this film, and I do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth.
1.0 	 I to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying.
0.99 	 It's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well.
0.74 	 I also have to say that overall, the movie leaves me cold.
0.72 	 If the robot was not in this film, I don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is.
0.98 	 The second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "Krell."
0.99 	 This time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain the possession of his dream machine, a bright red 'Vette.
1.0 	 Her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good, and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit.
0.98 	 Hooray for Annie!
0.84 	 You feel as if you're still in class.
0.99 	 A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players.
0.77 	 They all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating.
0.56 	 Too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids.
0.52 	 Something you'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap.
0.66 	 Please.
1.0 	 The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this.
0.94 	 The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning.
0.7 	 I didn't like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again.
0.7 	 It's a parody of crime-life, parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930.- There is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5.
0.81 	 Its a opinion of a mass, and mass is hypnotized.
1.0 	 To be perfectly honesty, after seeing the movie, do I really want to?
0.69 	 To be perfectly honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin".<br /><br />How do I describe a TV movie?
0.83 	 A wrinkle in time includes only one.
0.53 	 As is this one.
0.97 	 To top it off, you'll most likely forget about it the second it's over.
0.53 	 But within a few minutes.<br /><br />A wrinkle in time:*/****
0.93 	 Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth.
0.78 	 Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully.
0.58 	 The Cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary.
1.0 	 I would not consider myself as one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans.
1.0 	 He does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage.
1.0 	 By far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his own life and career.
0.99 	 Warming and humble.
0.9 	 Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton were the exceptions, even though Leonard highly values Rufus Wainrights interpretations of his songs.<br /><br />What particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect to him.
0.94 	 A lot is said in this respect, but the viewer is not drawn into the person Leonard Cohen.
0.95 	 This failing is especially evident with the interviews with Bono and the Edge.
0.82 	 They view Leonard as a special icon, but can't translate their exact value of Leonard Cohen.
0.52 	 Perhaps a reference to his once use of LSD.<br /><br />Some unintentional humor ... at some point Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre.
0.81 	 Initially he can't recall the genre's name, until eventually he says it was punk, the punksters really picked up on his music.
0.59 	 I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre.
0.96 	 I classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial.
0.99 	 Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak.
0.76 	 In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted."
0.89 	 Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved.
0.99 	 Katherine Heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables.
0.72 	 Hard Rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie.
0.9 	 I can't agree with any of the comments.
0.86 	 I couldn't believe what I was seeing and got hooked instantly.
0.86 	 The plot may be as bad as a JS's show (ie there is no plot) but the acting is wicked, it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie.
0.68 	 What Page didn't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived.<br /><br />A beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure, Page is spotted on Coney Island one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photograph which leads to her posing in his basement and eventually to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who cater their kitschy but considered pornographic stills to a unique clientele: fetish types.<br /><br />Although Page is rather naÃ¯ve she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least abides in what is offered her as work in that it is not indecent and she is having fun in her increasingly less-clothed portraits - until a Congressional witch-hunt seeks out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime.
0.74 	 See my reviews) and now this The Flock which apparently was meant to be a big release considering it's substantial 35 million + budget.
0.87 	 I think part of the problem that people seem to have with it is that it Hollywood-izes a very serious issue but I don't think it does it with disrespect but rather tries to take a different spin to make people aware that this exists.
0.82 	 He holds no punches in tracking these people, following them and making absolutely sure they don't re-offend and if they do he'll be the one to identify and stop them any way he can.
1.0 	 It takes liberties by really trying to make the film more entertainment than educational but it's just a different angle not unlike the Nicholas Cage dud 8MM.
0.99 	 I encourage you all to ignore poor reviews and see it for yourself because it's worth checking out!!
0.59 	 I give it a ***1/2 out *****.
0.98 	 My only complaint is that there wasn't enough Inspector Lestrade.
1.0 	 eventually, we learned that the film was "Up The Academy", and was a bit ummm, "lower brow" than we had been led to believe.
1.0 	 I was 17, and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post "Animal house" type of comedy, right down to the fart jokes.
0.9 	 Too bad my Pinto's brief appearance, usually seems to get cut for TV.
0.75 	 I also didn't like when all her friends were being shot (or not I don't know)and she goes in the van and puts band aids on.
0.86 	 Why does he want to break the football streak?
0.64 	 Lookit me I'm being funny!"
0.79 	 The ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman has returned to the swamp to kill all those who lynched him as well as all of their off spring.
0.99 	 If there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production.
0.96 	 The fog does create a mood but it also hides the fact that this swamp is entirely on dry land.
1.0 	 If the person in charge of casting were to have put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse(excepting Richard Dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself "acting").
0.99 	 I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain.
0.96 	 It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability.
0.73 	 He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father.
0.86 	 All the characters that are meant to be likable aren't and everyone else is the 'bad' boyfriend.
1.0 	 Watching the elephants trudge for days, nearly delirious from lack of water, is oh so painful.
0.78 	 But their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling.<br /><br />Some of the underwater shots are breathless.
0.56 	 I don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie!
0.98 	 The rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a Biograph or Vitagraph short of the time.
0.97 	 Starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame-by-frame animation.
0.93 	 Mrs. Beetle thrashes Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen, and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire.
0.76 	 The insect characters carry briefcases, drive motorcars, and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would.
0.6 	 The novelty of the story doesn't wear itself out, even after multiple viewings, but as fluid as the movements are, the film moves slowly.
0.94 	 If you think that a film can't fatigue in some way, then you haven't seen Dog Bite Dog.
0.9 	 It basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game, against a professional and emotionless hit-man.
0.85 	 While the script offers nothing new on the surface, it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity.
0.96 	 Do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child, without pity, without remorse?
0.65 	 In turn, we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger, this is a sad truth.
0.92 	 However, as many have pointed out, this is not a movie for everyone.
0.8 	 If you don't like seeing heavy negativity in film then this isn't for you too.
0.91 	 There will never be a female turtle, this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more.
0.88 	 Poorly-made "blaxploitation" crime-drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s.
0.88 	 Pam Grier stars in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after drug-dealing thugs make Coffy's little sister a junkie.
0.63 	 This movie only had one good thing about it, and that's that Ben Stiller was in it.
0.78 	 Can we say "Forces of Nature??"
1.0 	 It was a bore, but watching Stiller is always a delight!!
0.51 	 !
0.99 	 No, Liza doesn't get to sing.
0.57 	 She plays a diner waitress.
0.52 	 I wasn't sure what to expect but am I glad I went to see this.
0.94 	 to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as nothing can be).
0.73 	 This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken "camp" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself.
0.89 	 I think his offerings, especially with James Spader, and the others on "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfying quantity of Bill Shatner's offerings.<br /><br />Again, the above rating is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance, perhaps one time; that should be sufficient.
0.92 	 <br /><br />Hanging around a trucker rest-stop Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action, in the back seat of his buggy.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Seeing her chance Miya jumps into Trent's car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie.
0.94 	 Going all across the North Eastern USA the two end up involved in a truck car smash-up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to Trent's parents home, with them being held hostage.
0.84 	 It's there that there's another wild shootout between the crazed Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers.
1.0 	 In fact the film is very disturbing in how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child-molesting father Roy.
0.71 	 <br /><br />Needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on his cellphone from Miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back.
0.85 	 Like the jerk that he is Trent picks up Miya, who's now a fugitive from he law, and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway as he tries to run both Trent & Miya off the road.
0.93 	 <br /><br />With both a holdup and murder, as well as a hit and run, charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a S&M/Tattoo boutique where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains, by Myri, together with a matching his and hers dog collar.
0.88 	 This in order to meet his straight-laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner.
0.87 	 What's the background?
0.51 	 It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmer's famous Oriental villain but it lacks any focus.
0.83 	 The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental overtones of Rohmer's concept are ignored.
1.0 	 He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith.
1.0 	 Sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad; he conveys a quirky warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment.
0.99 	 If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedic genius, they won't learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
0.84 	 Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising.
0.96 	 There is a double question the movie poses.
0.71 	 Like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself.
0.82 	 Bad plot (though good for a B-movie), good fast-paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10.
0.93 	 But something has always bothered me about this film: how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks?
0.99 	 In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden.
0.95 	 Yet in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all.
0.9 	 The horse is a beast that battles in an almost unbearable heat, in heat that's much stronger than his will as he doesn't have any control at that point anymore.
0.73 	 Flesh desires flesh and that belongs to being a humanimal, but still those things are not so easily admitted everywhere and films like these trying to depict it get banned for decades?
0.96 	 Man's stupidity and unwillingness to interpret images must not be an argument for a film being banned or otherwise violated.<br /><br />The film's last 30 minutes are also as important as the beginning, and once again show how powerful cinema is without needless words and talk.
0.81 	 The ending is inevitable but the meaning of the dream sequence could have also been as powerful without the kind of dramatic and "revealing" ending too.
0.97 	 To every innocent white sheep there's a selfish, evil and horrible beast in our world and that is why the intelligence we have been given never fully seems to overcome the power of our bad instincts and the other side of the sheep, present inside every human soul.
0.56 	 <br /><br />And remember kids- "Theres more motion in the ocean"
0.67 	 It's pretty much along the line of "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and that one tends to be rather disliked by many.
1.0 	 So I suppose several people would deem "That Lady in Ermine" to be outdated and stuffy.
0.99 	 Rukh is careless, however, and poisons himself, glowing in the dark rather like those old Ready Breck commercials!
0.97 	 Dr. Benet is on hand to devise a counter-active for the radiation, but combination of poison and cure drives Rukh insanely paranoid.
0.94 	 and the Radium X device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members.
0.94 	 First off, it was clean, and I mean by my standards.
0.55 	 Unlike The Brady Bunch Movie, where the anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculed, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity.
0.61 	 This movie shuns the we-need-to-enlighten-this-wholesome-girl tack so many Hollywood movies take.
0.91 	 There were several suspenseful moments where my daughter nervously grabbed my arm, but there were no gratuitous shock scenes.
0.96 	 Almost no USD at all.
1.0 	 This is not a "B" or "C" movie.
0.8 	 The characters are likable, and the plot is not challenging or upsetting.
0.95 	 It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don't count it as fifty minutes ill-spent.
0.81 	 Are we really making 'video nasties' again?
0.63 	 In the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8MM, this is quite a ride.
1.0 	 I am however being rather churlish for the 'depraved' scenes, including everything from, hot wax, harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning, beheading and some.
0.96 	 It's a lot easier to imitate something else, than to create a real story with real characters.
0.88 	 I know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.
0.95 	 As has been pointed out, she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter?
1.0 	 Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years.
0.99 	 The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers.
0.54 	 Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him.
0.98 	 The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs.
0.94 	 It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them.
0.66 	 Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals?
0.62 	 To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war, it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government.
0.8 	 If you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country, don't watch Mistral's Daughter.
0.99 	 I've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres , on its viewers.
0.99 	 I love it.
1.0 	 This movie is SO scary - this is the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life!
0.94 	 Not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was Brendan's fabulous acting.
0.67 	 Best horror film EVER.
0.88 	 Halloween viewing at its evilest.
1.0 	 A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value Christmas and just enjoying the holiday.
0.61 	 Charlie Brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of Christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for Peggy Jean ($25 gloves...what?).
0.97 	 Also, Sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day: "Hark!"
0.99 	 Marcy is funny with her responses to Patty, but Patty is another story.
0.63 	 All in all, it tries to be a parasite to the original, but compromised the message for a few quick laughs.
1.0 	 I was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever.
0.55 	 The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings.
0.52 	 So They have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding.
1.0 	 Even so, does she have an accent?
0.87 	 I think I can tell she does.
0.97 	 We may imagine the elapsed years since have done it, but does Eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu?
0.63 	 Or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself?
0.99 	 For a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, LÃ©aud hair, with a direction-seeking nose.
1.0 	 I have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry.
0.99 	 I was that age, but have no idea what I myself looked like then.
0.98 	 No scarf, at least.
1.0 	 Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose Great Grandmama once stepped off the train at Edinburgh Waverley.
1.0 	 "Robin Hood - Prince of thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison.And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
1.0 	 I read a few reviews of this TV movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment.
0.99 	 I agree that perhaps, the film goes on a bit too long (2h30 would have been enough...) but I certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter.
0.57 	 It is mind-boggling to see an egalitarian, left-wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator.
0.94 	 Not to let it be repeated again.
0.94 	 Like, ironically, the inscription in Jim Jones' camp: "Those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it".
0.99 	 Simon Pegg made an OK appearance, slightly worse than his usual.
0.93 	 If you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it.
0.92 	 When childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie; it's touch and go whether you should revisit it.
0.98 	 Anyway, I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless person and a cool villain played by Jeff Kober.<br /><br />"The First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say.
1.0 	 But enjoyable as such, especially if you have fond memories of it.
0.95 	 It scared me as a kid and that scene with the homeless person is still pretty good.
0.93 	 And who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here?
0.71 	 As for Tracy Griffith as the psychic, the less said the better.
0.99 	 But Kober is pretty good as the killer; always liked that actor.<br /><br />"The First Power" may be just what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a "brain switch-off" is needed.
0.97 	 Beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience and I'll definitely have loads of it the next time I give this movie a spin.
1.0 	 All in all; not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids.
0.86 	 "See you around, buddy boy"!
0.75 	 In the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series.
0.97 	 The effects are so bad you just have to laugh, and the acting, well lets say its no mel gibson.
0.93 	 But Gary Browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad, he becomes good.
0.87 	 It gives the basic summary of what is going on.
0.98 	 Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about, keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them.
0.7 	 I have never played the video game, but know people who have.
0.88 	 What they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves.
0.74 	 I say almost because sadly Travis Mayweather's character played by the Briton Anthony Montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season.
0.92 	 That's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on.
0.93 	 And then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all.
0.97 	 Whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score.
0.9 	 He gives hope to all of us bumbling, stumbling, gangly, pale folk who are still searching for that special someone.
0.91 	 So, a couple of days ago I inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time.
0.99 	 Yeah, the experience wasn't as great as I remembered
 The acting is pretty bad, the storyline is pretty bad, the jokes weren't funny anymore, but the women were still pretty.
0.84 	 Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen films, but who has never really registered for me.
0.92 	 Early on in the film, he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of "justice".
0.97 	 This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story.
0.66 	 Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded.
0.8 	 Neither ever learns better.
0.95 	 Is this realistic?
0.63 	 <br /><br />Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority.
0.52 	 Spare me.
0.8 	 <br /><br />This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes.
1.0 	 It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time.
0.99 	 Even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema.
0.55 	 The characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative Genie right down to the flying carpet.
0.99 	 Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break.
0.95 	 Not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard.<br /><br />-If you ever wanted to see a live action version of "Aladdin" then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea.
0.88 	 Some of the movie was shot aboard the U.S.S.
0.8 	 Fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men.
0.86 	 It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still "standing tall."
0.58 	 The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor.<br /><br />My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander.
0.87 	 Not a big criticism, is it?
0.95 	 Not that he'd care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends.
0.98 	 When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues.
0.99 	 Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him, even though he's done nothing nice.
0.99 	 The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
0.79 	 And boy, was it ever!
0.68 	 Filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma.
0.99 	 The viewer gets to see these deaths, and they ARE pretty horrible, for the most part.
0.53 	 The film does indeed send shivers up the viewer's spine, and in the uncut DVD that I just watched--thanks to the fine folks at Synapse--even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism!
0.97 	 Not for nothing has she been called "The Queen of Horror."
0.92 	 <br /><br />Nancy: "I wonder why those guys were trying to kill us?!"
0.99 	 Corky: "Yeah, I was wondering that too.
0.92 	 Actually, it's kinda creeping me out!
0.53 	 "<br /><br />Nancy: "I hate when people try to kill me.
0.98 	 It's so rude!
0.96 	 This sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk.
0.99 	 This probably plays on the Lifetime network.<br /><br />There was a quick murder scene and then more talk.
0.66 	 The film centers on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `The Sea That Thinks.'
0.65 	 As he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay.
0.9 	 Before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality.
0.51 	 (Dutch with English subtitles) --Eric Moore
0.8 	 Themes were pulled from various sources; a few being The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film), and The Ring.
0.75 	 The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria.
0.59 	 Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red.
1.0 	 If you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead.
1.0 	 You'll thank me.<br /><br />
0.87 	 There is a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical.
0.96 	 Impressed!
0.93 	 (Saying this for your own welfare!)
0.72 	 Keep searching, you will find something else to watch!
0.96 	 The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers' career.
1.0 	 I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done, with the occasional lines that will be remembered.
1.0 	 I hate to admit it, but I laughed out loud with that line.<br /><br />Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film as well, not a way to end a career), and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI).
1.0 	 These characters also kept me watching.<br /><br />The sets were also nice.
1.0 	 Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture.<br /><br />In all honesty, my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan.
0.97 	 The people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted.
0.92 	 This movie blew Uncle Sam out of the water (it was made by tha same people, i think)
0.51 	 (
0.92 	 I got this in the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD.
1.0 	 You gotta love those bargain packs.
0.98 	 For even if they don't feature true remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format, there's no denying that there are always a few gems included.
0.66 	 And by "gems", I mean there's always some good crap to be seen, especially if the films are from the '70s as The Mansion of Madness is.<br /><br />My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens roll it's Poe's Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon.
1.0 	 The dialogue is always hilarious.
1.0 	 "WHAT STRENGTH!"
0.99 	 says Our Hero.
0.89 	 Funny, then, that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun.
1.0 	 That's how memorable these characters are.<br /><br />The best part about Mansion of Madness, however, has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure.
0.56 	 Oh yeah, there's plenty of boobies to be seen, too, for those of you that dig such things.
1.0 	 That best sums of Mansion of Madness for me.
0.87 	 It's well worth at least one viewing, and may be a lot better if you've had a few to drink or whatnot.
0.92 	 Kinda like Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot, but not.
0.98 	 He grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun.
0.6 	 SHOOT HIM!
0.67 	 SHOOT HIM NOW!
0.98 	 At the end, a newspaper says "PULITZER PRIZE WINNER STORY RIGHT HERE" or something right above on a front page of a paper, when its like the first time the story is printed.
0.98 	 So how in the heezy did someone win a Pulitzer for it that fast?
0.66 	 Silly, simplistic, and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE) goes nowhere.<br /><br />This brief (just over sixty minutes) tale isn't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns as it is a rip-off of Sam Raimi's THE QUICK & THE DEAD (his admitted homage to the spaghetti Westerns) brought into a contemporary setting.
0.9 	 In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father (a brief cameo by Gary Sinise) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head.
1.0 	 In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by the nimble Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the dastardly Mr. Tojo (played with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck.
0.99 	 Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter, Saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo.
0.96 	 Just watch it for yourself.
0.99 	 Try not to laugh.<br /><br />The image quality is average for the DVD release.
0.99 	 Every Sunday, a trio of buds get together at a NYC diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before.
0.52 	 All three of them!
0.5 	 Indeed, a heh-heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages.
0.54 	 A big fat Kermit the Frog "Sheesh" to that.<br /><br />It's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting, a smart, cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop-out ending.<br /><br />P.S.
0.97 	 This movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film-noir to it.
1.0 	 He's a former child-star who always used to star in in happy comical- and musical productions at the start of his career.
0.65 	 In this movie he picks a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the movie).
0.98 	 I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player?
0.84 	 He's an extremely small boyish looking man.
0.96 	 He simply isn't convincing in his role.<br /><br />Because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one.
0.57 	 Somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot-line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all.
0.73 	 It just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch.
0.95 	 LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957.
0.68 	 His movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality.<br /><br />Let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's.
0.73 	 Generally speaking black & white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception.<br /><br />It's a rather strange sight seeing Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence.
1.0 	 I guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie.
0.92 	 The movie actually received an Oscar nomination for best original song.<br /><br />An awkward little movie and outing from Mickey Rooney.<br /><br />4/10
0.87 	 Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career.<br /><br />I have my reasons.<br /><br />Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the eponymous Soldier.
0.92 	 Todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner.
0.84 	 The inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings.
0.99 	 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in OUR world, in HIS it can only be worse.
0.63 	 Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them.
0.53 	 An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance.
0.77 	 side of the Atlantic....<br /><br />And then, behold, there was "I Woke Up Early the Day I Died" - a movie that SHOULD have been so 'big', yet which disappeared into the ether even before Fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite.
0.95 	 The 1990s NEEDED a hard-to-find movie though which would REALLY be worth hunting out: and this, to be sure is it....
0.87 	 However, there is thankfully more to be found!!!
0.78 	 BEG, BORROW, STEAL, KILL or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these!!!!!!
1.0 	 "All In The Family" was a brilliant show for its first four or five years and I bet I watched every episode more than once.
0.98 	 We purchased this series on DVD because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here.
0.97 	 I gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting, directing and writing are brilliant.
0.97 	 In fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series.
0.97 	 A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide "Infomercials" and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world.
0.62 	 As a student of history myself I would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during WWII.<br /><br />So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so.
0.64 	 eg.
0.99 	 The series was a colossal disappointment--even with William Castle as exec.
0.97 	 You won't be disappointed.
0.98 	 Ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles.
0.99 	 Do they reenact their pranks, games, good times?
0.54 	 Horror?
0.72 	 Comedy?
0.92 	 Where are all the great British writers hiding?
0.83 	 <br /><br />The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it.
0.99 	 Whats sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed.
0.98 	 You sit there for a half an hour and watch a story, believing it all, then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling... and then put back together again.
0.9 	 Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a.
0.98 	 National Lampoon's Movie Madness:<br /><br />1.
0.5 	 2.
0.54 	 It's not funny.
0.98 	 It would be like calling Austin Powers 'An American Guy Goes to the Movies.'
0.78 	 'Hmm, Movie Madness Â I've never heard of this movie before!
0.8 	 And then, the realization: 'Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!
0.73 	 '<br /><br />It was shelved by MGM/UA, never to be released into theaters or DVD; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade, which is just about the only place you'll manage to find it.<br /><br />It's split up into three stories Â a parody of self-enlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality/cop-buddy films (I guess).
0.63 	 The first segment stars Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff.
0.69 	 This contains the only funny line in the movie: 'Only I can make love with my son!'
0.84 	 And just imagine Â it's the highlight of this film!<br /><br />Part III is about a cop who chases down a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy.
0.99 	 It does contain one funny scene but it's extremely over-acted Â only Lloyd really exhibits any humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal.
1.0 	 Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.<br /><br />I like National Lampoon's Vacation series (or, at least three of four installments), and their classic Animal House, but their recent slew of direct-to-video bombs such as Golf Punks (with that great comic genius Tom Arnold) provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago.
1.0 	 It gets really old, really fast.<br /><br />Sad to see a new film, called Gold Diggers, is being released with their 'stamp of approval.'
0.99 	 It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval.
0.82 	 after kissing him.
0.6 	 The results were: <br /><br />1.
0.75 	 However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred.
0.99 	 Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
0.93 	 I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R.
1.0 	 She couldn't dance for peanuts, she didn't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance.
0.84 	 Marion, a top mimic, also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand, that was Gloria Swanson spot on!!
0.91 	 Charlie Chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesn't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely.
0.94 	 "Who was that short little guy" - when she finds out she faints!!!
0.96 	 When she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew.
0.99 	 It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old Peggy back.
0.59 	 Nothing seems to even try and be realistic.
0.93 	 Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago, committed a murder with a knife, and came out calm and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if slashing one's throat is done by a virtual agent.
0.62 	 Also, this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male, and she cut his throat!!!
0.92 	 Next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception-area, asking for guidance to scenery spots!
0.84 	 NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT???
0.84 	 For some time we are apt to side with the script writer, who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality (`man', `catholic', `window washer').
0.94 	 And together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can one eliminate from the future movie.
0.78 	 Really, what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter?<br /><br />So who is he, this Bart Klever?
0.59 	 Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves.<br /><br />
0.62 	 With all thats going on in the world sometimes we need an escape.
0.89 	 Curly Sue is just that.
1.0 	 Not a complicated plot or deep meaning; however it is not devoid of substance.
0.98 	 Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son.
0.73 	 Freddy (Robert Englund) is letting him go and the teenager doesn't have much of a memory, when he's arriving in a new town.
0.96 	 From a story by the director.
0.59 	 (*** Â½/*****).
0.99 	 I have heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends have recommend me to read it.
0.57 	 I searched it in every place and finally found it.
0.99 	 This is a book that every man should read, because it is genius and because of it's vision.
0.94 	 I enjoyed every page.<br /><br />I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it.
0.85 	 John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I myself could see as Winston Smith.<br /><br />What angers me the most are the people in IMDb that called this "The Best Adaptation Ever" without even reading the book!
0.86 	 (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions.
0.96 	 Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and "National Treasure" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping.
0.76 	 Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed).
0.71 	 That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre.
0.95 	 By the numbers story of the Kid (Prince), a singer, on his way to becoming a star.
0.98 	 Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero).
1.0 	 But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!)
0.82 	 and his own self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />I saw this in a theatre in 1984.
1.0 	 The concert scenes in this movie are great--full of energy and excitement.
0.99 	 Appolonia is sweet and beautiful--but no actor.
0.94 	 This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many.
0.52 	 To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for anyone.<br /><br />PS- Not for kids, gratuitous violence included.
1.0 	 I predict a long run for this series... And just to be clear, the people who are offended by this show just don't get it... perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it... they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don't understand.
1.0 	 Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $25million.
0.89 	 One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women.
0.98 	 We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York, while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman.
0.98 	 He's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone.
0.99 	 No serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes.
0.99 	 As a former Kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town I was looking forward to seeing this movie.
0.57 	 Has the writer been living under a rock?
0.78 	 <br /><br />Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone.
1.0 	 This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh.
0.97 	 I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of "Voyage to the Earth's Core" and "Mysterious Island".
0.74 	 Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp "Ogar" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers.
0.98 	 This weekend just passed I watched "28 Weeks Later" which was very good.
0.76 	 And the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight.
0.96 	 After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin.
0.54 	 The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one.
0.67 	 I thought it was not very funny.
0.95 	 I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too.
0.64 	 Shaved Balls).
0.93 	 I felt the movie ended too abruptly, but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending (see "Stepmom.")
0.94 	 This is also a "horror" film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight.
0.78 	 It cannot be that high in demand.
0.91 	 <br /><br />The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is British and half the time she is American.
0.74 	 this film tries to be immensely clever, and Tarantino-like <br /><br />before you try that though, you need solid filmic fundamentals.
0.58 	 these include good sound, editing, set design etc...<br /><br />lets talk about the sound in this movie.
0.89 	 i have never been more distracted by a sound track, ever<br /><br />and before we talk about low budget, film made in Chile etc.. lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been.
0.99 	 how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise?
0.98 	 Chile's cinematic new wave?
1.0 	 the best creative output that Chile has to offer?
0.97 	 equally, the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called 'world-cinema' enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons.
0.87 	 they likely revel in it's trashiness.
0.7 	 the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porno!
0.92 	 See, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs.
0.95 	 The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force "half as strong" as what was used for Hiroshima.
0.88 	 There's even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what.
0.54 	 That means that our Mr. Smarty-pants security guy isn't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this film would be about, you know, dragons.<br /><br />Putting that aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects."
0.98 	 These things are funny to watch, however.
0.61 	 The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not.
0.74 	 Nor are the "introduction" screens with the vital stats.<br /><br />Coming to the actors, they weren't the greatest, but I guess at least they tried?
0.68 	 They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent "BloodRayne," for example, and you've got to give them points for that.
0.99 	 One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in make-up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her.
1.0 	 The movie is halve CGI/halve real life but it's not done halve as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as "Sin City" and "300".
0.6 	 Than just don't say anything at all Mr. Horus!
1.0 	 It rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic, mostly modern, science-fiction movies.
0.55 	 Elephant Walk (1954) Starring an early Peter Finch as lord of the manor in some God-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad Englishmen, staying out in the midday sun and going berserk.
0.94 	 Well eventually they do, after the typhoid or cholera outbreak, of course, and much mayhem ensues.
0.96 	 Taylor replaced an ailing Vivien Leigh in this pot boiler/adventure flick.
0.91 	 When the elephants storm the house and trap Liz on the grand staircase I still get goose bumps.
0.72 	 In color too!
0.99 	 One of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon.
0.96 	 It is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS.
0.99 	 Out of concern for his youth, they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother, 12-year old Marcel (Yannis Lespert) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically.
0.92 	 Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting.
0.73 	 The American knock-off was a little flat.<br /><br />Few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as Adolph.
1.0 	 My guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort, but that just got wasted on me.<br /><br />What I felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects.
0.95 	 Some kid becomes "The one" and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway.
0.96 	 I couldn't really discern the plot.<br /><br />Bottom line: nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.
0.95 	 I found it as an offer in a magazine and that's why I've seen it.
0.99 	 I really wanted to like this movie - the location shots were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography.
0.66 	 It was well acted to the point that at times I forgot that I was watching a movie.
0.61 	 If anyone, of ANY Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way--I would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the movie.
1.0 	 The film is undeserving of it's Cat III (nudity) rating; there are no nude scenes whatsoever, and the 'love' scenes do not even involve kissing or 'making out'.<br /><br />The message which this film presented to me?
0.89 	 All human beings, no matter how violent or cruel they may seem, have a tender side.
0.99 	 This film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or b&w.
0.9 	 I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film.
0.95 	 Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b/c she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1.
0.68 	 Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops, "If you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the f**k out of here!"
0.55 	 I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD, uncut, because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be.
0.99 	 Let's set one thing straight: this movie does not seek to redefine the genre, it's not Dr. Strangelove o Young Frankenstein.
0.93 	 Poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even get a date with a blind guy), Posey is an assistant for a senator (who "hasn't been touched by a man since Clinton was in office"... i catched that one several minutes later... i'm a little slow, OK!
0.66 	 (Han still is frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba's guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter.
0.99 	 At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into Jabba's monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it.
0.91 	 Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han,Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'.
0.51 	 Luke,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc's mouth.
0.98 	 I watched this film a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and liked it then.
0.93 	 I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again.
0.98 	 The second time around was not pleasant.
0.95 	 Ding, Ding...we have a crook!).
1.0 	 I'm glad Maddin has an appreciation for silent film, but I dislike his films for the same reason I dislike the films of Quentin Tarantino: they're empty homages to better, more imaginative films--films that advanced the art form or broke new ground--and are all style and no substance.
0.61 	 The bottom line is, Maddin's schtick is clever clever film-making for aspiring film majors.
0.74 	 I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian based.
1.0 	 I can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life.
0.57 	 The main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him.
0.53 	 They weren't understanding at all and they used God as a reason to explain their behaviors.
0.83 	 The main character, nor anyone else didn't know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with.
0.73 	 This movie didn't hold true to the Christian belief of love but i give it a C for its effort.
0.84 	 I assume that before "Starship Troopers", "Killshot" was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise.
0.84 	 The new title of "Kill Shot" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema.
0.69 	 The quick cuts, cheesy "Melrose Place" music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for.<br /><br />And I don't mind at all.
0.76 	 After looking it up on IMDB, my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here).
0.86 	 In any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.<br /><br />All in all, it's entertaining.
0.87 	 No.
0.97 	 Well, why not - it's better than Baywatch.
0.99 	 And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s.
0.99 	 There were a few cheesy shots, but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film.
0.87 	 The only complaint I can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details.
0.93 	 However, this movie wasn't created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures etc.
0.96 	 I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot.
1.0 	 There's little to get excited about "Dan in Real Life".
0.6 	 For that matter, I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie.
1.0 	 The film claims to be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in real life, was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals' welfare in the best interest.
0.98 	 buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate (not a plush cage room as depicted in movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him.
0.79 	 Notice also, in the film, how Buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age.
0.85 	 and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting.
0.98 	 So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death.
0.98 	 The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film.
0.52 	 The rest of it plays out like a mindf@ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix (full-frontal nudity, some gore) to keep you happy.<br /><br />I say check this out.
0.55 	 Interesting?
0.97 	 Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens.
1.0 	 Now that was I movie I was impressed with.
0.96 	 This is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer.
0.81 	 In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so.
0.51 	 Uh-huh.
0.82 	 Even for it's nazi-propaganda genre.
0.51 	 2/10.
0.97 	 Rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie.
0.51 	 All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house.
0.53 	 Packed with loads of Laughs, this is one Non stop Entertainer.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.65 	 But Aestheically A+.
0.99 	 This movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc.
0.65 	 etc.
0.72 	 problems.
0.97 	 First off, the most annoying character dies first!
0.9 	 Mary found very incriminating evidence at his place, and she still trusted him?
0.99 	 I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack.
0.69 	 Like who are the druids really?
0.54 	 Are they people?
1.0 	 Perhaps if your new to animÃ© films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it.
1.0 	 It certainly is visually pleasing.
1.0 	 I've always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past.
0.98 	 This presentation of "Byron" was unbelievable.
1.0 	 My worst fears were that it would be plodding, as well as... well, you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about?
0.93 	 That sort of thing?
0.55 	 Dreading it.
0.9 	 The movie was surprisingly watchable, even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes, and the acting on Gackt's part was quite good.
0.55 	 He's one of my two major beefs with the film itself.
0.78 	 But the rest of the cast (including the child actors in the opening scene) were very good at doing what they did- which was, mostly, get shot at and yelled at.
0.97 	 But my second problem was very minor, having to do with the goriness.
0.75 	 It seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over, really most sincerely dead, or lay there burbling for a rather long time.
0.99 	 So it shouldn't come as any surprise that at one stage a B-52 bomber does a fly- through in a Yoshinoya look-alike franchise.
0.76 	 Technicolor Musicals were what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed.
0.61 	 Depressing how quickly we forget.<br /><br />This film could've been called "The Search for Jose Iturbi" but now everyone wonders why.
0.75 	 Allow me to explain.
0.69 	 Grayson's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time.
1.0 	 Kelly was already well-known as a dancer, but Iturbi had by then been a world-wide sensation for 20+ years.<br /><br />And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot.
0.93 	 This movie and others like it delivered just what was needed.<br /><br />Enough lecturing.
0.51 	 I was interested in the topic, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dancing on David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it.
0.75 	 Give me a break.
0.71 	 At last!
0.65 	 A decent British comedy that isn't centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a TV series.
0.53 	 But take it from me, if you enjoy watching poor, yet goofy, movies, you will enjoy "Gymkata" a great deal.<br /><br />The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least I think they were government agents) to become a spy.
0.98 	 You see his dad was another quasi-government agent, who has gone missing competing in this game, called, eloquently, "The Game."
0.74 	 They can be found in the movie's strange details.
0.81 	 Or the really tough shirtless bad guy who likes to make and break "The Game"'s non-existent rules whenever he so pleases.
1.0 	 And of course there's our hero's delightful romp through the "Village of The Crazies" (Evidently that's the place's real name!).
0.99 	 Nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.<br /><br />But where this movie really shines is the action scenes.
0.96 	 It has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />One interesting thing of note.
0.99 	 If these were indeed effects, my one major note of compliment to whoever devised these very realistic arrows wounds.
0.95 	 Nevertheless, "Gymkata" deserves a look if you can see it without paying and are looking for some silliness that is an easy target for riffing.<br /><br />
0.98 	 I was really looking forward to it, as I thought "Lantana" was great.<br /><br />The following review may contain *spoilers*<br /><br />*****<br /><br />First, the good things: it looks great, some of the performances are OK.
0.65 	 <br /><br />The story, as you possibly know, is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body, with the twist that they find it on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they get back into mobile (cell phone) range.
0.94 	 This is a mystery - everyone asks them "how could you do that?"
0.53 	 (The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance").
0.75 	 I know exactly what I'd do in their situation.
1.0 	 Huh?<br /><br />This is Australian film "at its finest", according to The Age.
0.83 	 Rating, 8.
0.94 	 Am I glad I did!
0.76 	 He's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease.
0.78 	 I gave it a 10 out of 10 on the IMDb.
0.74 	 Don't miss this film!
0.96 	 Warning: Does contain spoilers.<br /><br />Open Your Eyes<br /><br />If you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it.
0.73 	 I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film.
0.79 	 His name was Mr. Krisak.
0.96 	 To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on.
0.53 	 Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak.
0.79 	 But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him.
0.97 	 But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable.
0.95 	 This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine.
0.93 	 After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.<br /><br />"What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?
0.98 	 What a messed up question that is.
0.96 	 How possible could it seem back then?
0.65 	 This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another.
0.82 	 David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another.
0.99 	 There is no hanky panky.
1.0 	 They lack substance.
0.62 	 <br /><br />This is what film making is supposed to be like.
0.62 	 This is what a film is supposed to do to you.
0.87 	 It is supposed to make you feel something.
0.63 	 Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces.
0.99 	 None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame.
0.74 	 This is one film that should not be missed.
0.7 	 <br /><br />And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question.
0.98 	 Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination?
0.97 	 Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement?
0.99 	 I'm disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever.
0.82 	 Maybe that's his idea of "adult" films, plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in?
1.0 	 But the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails.
0.5 	 Certainly not worth spending money on, though it might be worth a watch for free on television.
0.61 	 There are references to many horror films, such as the wicker man.
0.91 	 Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier.
0.9 	 That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School.
0.51 	 Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class.
0.54 	 She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not.
1.0 	 The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief.
0.58 	 When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here.
0.92 	 David survives the crash, but is left with a disfigured face.
0.74 	 The thing is, David doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams (Most of which are actually nightmares.)
0.83 	 and flashbacks, some of which just don't make sense to him.
0.76 	 They are sure making a lot of "Are they dead, if not who is dead" movies recently.
1.0 	 The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this LAME movie.
0.8 	 It starts off with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min...in a Ferrari F430.
0.95 	 I did that in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord.
0.56 	 I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo going 30-40MPH>>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /><br />And...the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT!!!
0.98 	 He brings shame to his own race.
0.87 	 I wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into Hollywood.
0.51 	 He partook in a movie that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way.
0.94 	 Asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time .
0.85 	 He sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job.
0.5 	 There are many references and inside jokes about show business.<br /><br />The setting is clearly modeled on Paraguay.
0.59 	 station chief in Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out.
0.71 	 This is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries.
0.66 	 <br /><br />On yet another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character Madonna.
0.94 	 Lead singer Dylan (Sean Cook) & guitar player Mike (Jason McKee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player London (Brooke Bailey) & drummer Nancy (Tom Olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer.
0.66 	 Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently.
0.86 	 Those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for, right?
0.74 	 They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up.
0.77 	 My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie.
0.84 	 Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few.
0.85 	 So there must be something.
0.96 	 Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased?
0.87 	 And which format that would be?
0.93 	 Russell can't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium, but is otherwise rather wonderful.
0.59 	 <br /><br />To cap it all, it doesn't know which audience to aim at - we have Cornel Wilde - or is that Corny Wilde?
0.8 	 You never knew who would be going when.
0.5 	 And it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself!
0.96 	 Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin.
0.95 	 It'll offer you the same amount of fun..
0.57 	 I promise
0.82 	 I make just one apology for this film: there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough.
1.0 	 They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so.
1.0 	 But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased to care.
0.57 	 `Mystery Men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being.
1.0 	 The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless.
0.82 	 The satire of `Mystery Men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't.
0.99 	 It doesn't mock just any old thing.
0.98 	 Sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate.
0.97 	 The Blue Rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't THAT good at it.
1.0 	 On the other hand, neither is he comically bad.
0.99 	 He's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was.
0.51 	 I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect.
0.76 	 Normally when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head towards the B-Horror movies.
0.93 	 I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since they released they're first Demo in 1995.
0.91 	 The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the "Hardcore Goth kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps.
1.0 	 This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this "Movie" really is just an extended Cradle of Filth Video.
0.97 	 I didn't expect much from this, but I have to admit I was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film.
1.0 	 If you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes, this might be a film for you.
0.65 	 As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting.
0.95 	 Not so, as this film is very 'of its age', in the 1960's.
0.66 	 Sounds good, yeah?
0.82 	 In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator, who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van.
0.56 	 This one is a SHAME.<br /><br />2 out of 10, kids.
1.0 	 I was bored and looked through the t.v.
0.66 	 I cried for hours!
0.82 	 I think that the director/ writer should write more movies like this one.
0.66 	 I didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good.
0.93 	 Tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he's intimidating and uses it to get ahead.
1.0 	 Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen).
0.78 	 Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Cooper's era).
0.98 	 It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most.
0.5 	 Better luck next time, hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell.
0.97 	 Being a music student myself, I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch.
0.85 	 Just having a nice pop voice isn't enough, besides, that's a different thing altogether - another genre, different technique.
0.98 	 It's like playing the violin when applying for a viola class.
0.95 	 That would have been kept confidential, for the jury's eyes only.
0.94 	 Yes, she was able to sing the notes, but Carmen is a mezzo-soprano, while Holly's voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre, not at all compatible with that song.
0.6 	 I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!
0.91 	 It's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80% of the movie for no reason.
0.51 	 Somnambulistic?
0.51 	 What about the dead husband?
0.9 	 The Scotland Yard and military pursuers?
0.99 	 I would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all, not just the big panoramic pull-away.<br /><br />And what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband?
1.0 	 90 minutes of Mindy...Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill...Mindy prances at the high school dance...Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, shoplifts a loaf of "shepherd's bread," Mindy nearly gets gang-raped... Ah, the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features.
0.92 	 You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players.
0.6 	 They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations.
0.99 	 It's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it.
0.76 	 My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy.
0.99 	 Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps, "I'm going' to Big Sur!!"
0.98 	 But again, it's a lot more fun to talk/read about than sit through.
0.53 	 When I saw this movie first, it was long ago on VHS-Video.
0.6 	 They called this movie "KOR the conquerer".
0.99 	 No shop had this Kor-Movie to rent and no shop did know this movie.
0.94 	 Many years I watched my old VHS-tapes I had at home, and what a wonder...
0.52 	 THE MELTING MAN...a tragic victim of the space race, he perished MELTING...never comprehending the race had LONG GONE BY...!<br /><br />A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand on the kitchen stove.
0.97 	 But instead of screaming something a NORMAL person would scream, he shouts something that sounds like "AAAAATCH-KAH!!"
0.97 	 This movie you've popped in...isn't a normal movie.
1.0 	 <br /><br />It might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind-numbingly awful.
0.74 	 "Why did they...but how come he...why are they...?"
0.91 	 Eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man, but is shot by a security guard for no reason, after he explains that he's "Dr. Ted Nelson."
0.99 	 The melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo.
0.99 	 There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background.
0.58 	 The shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there's plenty of them.
0.87 	 "<br /><br />Her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much I never watched this film again until I acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her!
0.65 	 It happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.<br /><br />This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects, sad to say.
0.72 	 Quite frankly, I'm just happy Fido got picked up for US distribution.
0.76 	 (Seriously, that's what the press book in Toronto called it.)
0.66 	 Manual labor?
0.98 	 There's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed.
0.86 	 If that's not the case....well, you know the drill.
0.6 	 Just hit 'em square between the eyes.
0.91 	 It would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys, but Attenborough has not done this.
0.9 	 Sure, there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil, such as the Captain at the Soweto uprising, but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Film dominated by raven-haired Barbara Steele, it was seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle, seeking blood.
0.99 	 There's no such draw to HAUNTING's overwrought Claire Bloom.
0.99 	 The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.<br /><br />And no, this movie does NOT need to be remade.
1.0 	 Not only is it a product of the Sixties, but the large percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood cannot fathom MACABRE's formula for terror.
0.99 	 Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today's cinematic mess.
1.0 	 This move reminded my of Tales from the Crypt Keeper.
0.57 	 It has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve.
0.96 	 I think that's always the them in a Crypt story.
0.99 	 I have read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books.
0.95 	 I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such.
0.78 	 It was so good.
0.78 	 The endings were very different then the movie versions.
0.93 	 I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy.
0.96 	 I suggest everyone who intends to read stephen King's novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare.
0.98 	 And that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book.
0.68 	 I intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies.
0.66 	 Who the heck are you?
0.97 	 George: Me new George.
0.99 	 If you're a movie-watcher who wants a good, funny movie, You'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one..
0.92 	 Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding.
0.84 	 I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest.
0.62 	 Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time.
0.8 	 I wish I could find more movies like that one.
0.99 	 good movie, good music, good background and an acceptable plot.
0.81 	 although other movies are not far behind.
0.51 	 one man that will never ever disappoint you.<br /><br />good movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without.
0.89 	 Maybe you should go see the latest from the Hollywood studio's no brain club, but if you are looking for something more, he's where you will find it.
0.53 	 Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and this is unfortunate.<br /><br />In this film, the audience sees the pain and suffering Ms. Duke had been through, especially as a child.
1.0 	 However, we see as she advances in her career, yet the illness becomes worse.
0.79 	 <br /><br />What I remember of this movie is fragmented.
0.98 	 For some reason he was thrown out of his village (did not grasp the reason for this).
0.92 	 When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped off.
0.51 	 At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend.
0.51 	 !
0.51 	 Ash's friends were hardly in it, and all the fight scenes were boring.<br /><br />After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends, must return to their time, while watching Sam float away with Celebi (that scene was just creepy.
0.99 	 O-O;) Then, after returning to their time, Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival's grandpa.
0.7 	 If you love your children, you won't expose them to this.
0.87 	 To have shied away from the violence would have limited the film's impact, would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the Patriarchal discourse it is exposing.
0.93 	 This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously.
0.98 	 Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come.
1.0 	 This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen.
0.8 	 This is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and doesn't mean to at all) of the action genre.
1.0 	 The customers, at first immobile, at intervals chime in (badly but gamely) with phrases from the song, read from slips of paper in their palms.
0.51 	 On and off they jump up and dance (awkwardly but earnestly) in choreographed motions, like backup singers.<br /><br />But why???
0.74 	 What can I say, it's a damn good movie.
0.9 	 See it if you still haven't.
0.65 	 Thomas Ian Griffith as the cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists.
0.91 	 Complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly Kris Kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay Trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit.
0.62 	 Law"!
0.73 	 The child stars were just that; professional, quality actors.
0.93 	 I am most impressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys.
0.98 	 They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it.
0.92 	 While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent.
1.0 	 Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood.
0.97 	 Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through.
0.91 	 Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios.
1.0 	 Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters.
0.99 	 There is also some use of CGI, but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero.
0.68 	 The music was alright.
0.98 	 4.3 is just a punch "under the belt" (If say, 5 points is the belt).
0.66 	 Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason.
1.0 	 I Love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress.
0.71 	 Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, lets actually talk about this film.
0.99 	 Me being a Fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review's by clicking on my name, I have great taste.
0.7 	 "Executive Decision" should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the "Turbulence"-movies are better.
0.95 	 In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.
1.0 	 Iberia is nice to see on TV.
0.87 	 Lot of dance and music.
0.85 	 If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie.
0.61 	 If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie.
0.86 	 They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie.
0.85 	 Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience.
0.93 	 And time to time it's look really good.
0.76 	 but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting.
1.0 	 A refreshing, wacky, hilarious indie movie apparently.
0.81 	 It sucked in a very big way.
0.9 	 The sitcom "The league of Gentlemen" follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village "Royston Vasey".
0.93 	 The different scenes are linked together by their common setting.<br /><br />In the first series, a sketch show, the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through Royston Vasey.
0.73 	 Consequently, more foreigners visit the small town.
0.76 	 But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" shop, which is actually far away from the town, do not like foreigners.
0.76 	 Whenever a visitor enters their shop, they kill him.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Moreover Pauline lives in Royston Vasey.
0.91 	 She works at the local Job Centre.
0.94 	 Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to loose her job.
0.64 	 So when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman, she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet.<br /><br />Then there is Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about "her" sexual conversion.<br /><br />Furthermore the vet, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them.
0.78 	 In one case, he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room, where a dog lays in his basket.
0.58 	 The farmer goes outside.
0.83 	 A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the "real" sick animal, a sheep, in his hand.<br /><br />Some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew (his friend is killed by the shop owners, by the way).
0.97 	 The couple is very tidy.
0.52 	 They have, for example, towels in different colours.
0.65 	 Each colour stands for one part of the body.
0.96 	 Besides, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colours and precisely classified.<br /><br />In my opinion, the actors play very well.
1.0 	 The show has a great deal of dark humour, typical British.
1.0 	 The set design reflects the mood of the series.
0.95 	 Around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect.
0.98 	 Even the village sign is ominous: "Welcome to Royston Vasey.
1.0 	 "<br /><br />Although I think that the actors do a great job, this type of series is not my taste.
0.69 	 But she tries!
0.99 	 It's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you, always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family.
0.97 	 So, imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how tough that must be.
0.73 	 Then, wouldn't you know it, Fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to Christmas.
0.97 	 And hilarity and life lessons ensue.<br /><br />Well, that's what should happen.
0.96 	 Forget this and stick the hilarious Elf on again if you want a great, modern Christmas comedy.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause.
0.71 	 Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.<br /><br />As a kids movie, it gets a 7.
0.93 	 As a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith, and the nature of "god," it gets a 10.
0.83 	 You can tell things aren't right with the story.
0.87 	 I couldn't get "involved" with Treat Williams' portrayal of Cooper, either.
0.66 	 He should have been fascinating, but he wasn't in this movie.
0.98 	 I bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier.
0.64 	 What?
0.91 	 The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt.
0.51 	 I have to admit, I want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again, like in "Strike!
0.98 	 (1998)," when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time, and Tweety asked "Was it beautiful?
0.93 	 This new guy is something else entirely!!
1.0 	 If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, killing, religion, sports, business and anything else you might deem politically incorrect.
0.97 	 <br /><br />Actually, 'Absence of Light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema: It's the only time I've seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me.
0.94 	 Who are their characters?
0.82 	 Who cares?
0.57 	 Not surprisingly, so did most of the cast members in attendance.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this.
1.0 	 After reading the book, I loved the story.
0.7 	 It is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories, only the names and some of the book's story remained.
0.97 	 The book gives you a better development of the characters.
0.96 	 These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them.
1.0 	 Television has microwaved so many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of that.
0.98 	 Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism.
1.0 	 It's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world.
0.98 	 Hey, it's "open season" on them.<br /><br />Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible.
0.97 	 Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.<br /><br />He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations.
0.7 	 However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films.
0.66 	 It only adds fuel to the fire.
0.54 	 Better yet, "get over it.
0.87 	 From the slam of a screen door, to the lack of work, the echoes of what life is really like on the "red-neck riviera" provide rough choices for the young girl.
1.0 	 The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior.
0.76 	 Not that this would've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party, where someone's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next "blockbuster".
0.99 	 You get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium.
0.87 	 One scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists.
0.89 	 He's the LEAD male, so he should have some "hero" elements to his character, but he does not.
1.0 	 The cover of the DVD is nice, and that's where it ends.
0.98 	 <br /><br />When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss Tommy Scalese.
0.76 	 <br /><br />Thematically the film is nothing special.
0.97 	 In one scene Dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook, the film flirting with the notion of predestination, but this one scene is as far as Otto goes, or dares to take his ideas.<br /><br />The camera work is likewise disappointing.
0.98 	 There's no intelligence in Otto's camera.
0.98 	 No effort is made to assign the camera to anything.
0.97 	 It doesn't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step-by-step police procedural.
0.96 	 It's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out.
0.81 	 Meaningless, though most people don't care about these things.
0.6 	 This works well, but the set design fails to reinforce it.
0.97 	 When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one.
0.99 	 And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait.
0.66 	 Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment.
0.93 	 How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder....
0.91 	 I had to endure teen-aged, high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show.
0.79 	 We FINALLY see a proto-Cylon.
0.74 	 It was good but with one problem.
0.93 	 We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world.
0.97 	 I was very excited since I'm a big fan of Punk Rock, Horror films and Spoofs.
0.9 	 I was very surprised at what I saw.
1.0 	 It opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, The Horrorpops, reforming their song, Where They Wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways.
1.0 	 It's a great opening.
0.86 	 A live performance, A death.
0.88 	 Another live performance, A death.
0.99 	 Don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome.
1.0 	 Like the hardcore French band, known simply as BERET, the prospect of a band named Atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and Bowling For Soup's Overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that I will save for the future watchers of this movie.
0.99 	 Especially Warped Tour creator, Kevin Lyman.
0.95 	 something about a magic sword and Lloyd Kaufman as the devil.
0.74 	 Bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent Horror, Music, or Comedy film.
0.52 	 Such as Tsunami Bomb, and the Phenomonauts(an insane, Psychobilly band).
1.0 	 If not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances.
0.68 	 They rock!
0.73 	 Long live Punk Rock and Horror!
0.58 	 In reading other posts, I remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl, but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.<br /><br />I was going, a stamp?
0.83 	 Not yet anyway.<br /><br />There are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.
1.0 	 When the anime first opened itself, I felt it was too slow; the story wasn't quite moving forward, and Shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead.
0.88 	 But it's only the body of this movie.
0.94 	 And it's been removed.
0.72 	 All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium.
0.93 	 No bells or whistles, just the basics.
0.6 	 There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small.
0.53 	 That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless.
0.9 	 Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.<br /><br />If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time.
0.62 	 Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar.
0.8 	 Sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table...just sitting.
0.96 	 With his wife and child dead, Sullivan takes to the road to find answers.<br /><br />The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid, and for Michael who feels like he is to blame for all this.
0.99 	 The contracted future world is a symbol of human race's final destination which I adore it very much.<br /><br />The whole plot is fine for a Sci-Fi, not so intriguing but it's OK, like some Hollywood's products, a giant conspiracy about human's eternity, a little bit clichÃ© and the twisted ending is not so convincing, some development is just too plain and insipid, and the whole movie is too long.<br /><br />So I think I'm just in love with the style this film shows, others are not so good.<br /><br />About the eternity of life, I think most people have come to a unanimousness that we don't want eternity because it demolishes the meaning of life, we treasure our lives because they are limited and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, thus the world world will become a disaster and chaos.
0.95 	 Right as he dies, he looks up at the scarecrow and he let's his spirit go into the scarecrow.
0.52 	 We later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow.
0.8 	 They had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with "Takes one to know one, loser!"
1.0 	 We can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that.
0.99 	 They don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve.
0.98 	 It's night but light is streaming through the windows.
0.66 	 Come on!
0.82 	 There is no way Sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to Sam like it wasn't his first visit.
0.68 	 I just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it's sanctity.
0.99 	 Maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place (like Elicot's office) should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters.
0.98 	 Always stay together and watch each others backs!'
1.0 	 but they don't listen to me :o The Elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch.
0.92 	 The lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking.
0.65 	 Why are they all so serious?
0.99 	 It's just a movie and it's not pornographic.
0.87 	 I only wish it was longer.
0.99 	 The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to fix up the American song-and-dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles.
1.0 	 Seen today, the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he plies her with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain "fancy free" in the love department) and she gives him the brush-off.
0.98 	 This glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the London and Venice settings, but we watch simply because the leads are Fred and Ginger.
0.81 	 Definitely spoilers in this review!
0.83 	 Lucas Buck though lacking any conscience often works by, as he says, giving people enough rope to hang themselves with.
0.98 	 His manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals.
0.96 	 None of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic Merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in The Plague Sower.
1.0 	 I'm a huge Buffy fan, but when that show tried to go really 'dark' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas.
0.8 	 AG shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show, and still have a hell of laugh doing it.<br /><br />I can't even think about why it was cancelled as I'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all.
1.0 	 So much rubbish on TV and good, original shows get kicked around and stamped on.
0.98 	 So this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown 'truth' to find.
0.93 	 Yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects, with some such as the truth about Gails parents getting resolved, but unlike Lost and X-files this show isn't about trying to find out more 'facts' about what's going on IMO.
0.92 	 The only hanging thread I felt was Dr Matt.
1.0 	 Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways.
0.98 	 The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine.
0.97 	 Caine has the Olivier role in this version and he's paired with Jude Law.
0.96 	 Here the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh.<br /><br />The acting is spectacular.
0.99 	 Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their respective roles.
0.98 	 I really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities.
0.53 	 Michale Caine walks Law through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason.
0.77 	 Conversations happen repeatedly in different locations.
0.74 	 Why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that Law is sleeping with Caine's wife?
0.92 	 Missteps in that the choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller.
0.71 	 Instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesn't let them be real.<br /><br />despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work
0.59 	 I was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a Swedish film with subtitles.
0.96 	 I particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias, discrimination and sanctimonious pretence.
0.71 	 In my experience, never has so much been done with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.).
0.95 	 Almost a two-person play, and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important.
0.87 	 Neither are particularly good.
0.7 	 He wants to have her tell him about the daylight.
0.84 	 He would have been better off finding someone with a day job, or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet, but then they might not have a hot bod.<br /><br />After he gets her to do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good at it), he intends to feed on her at 6 AM, at which point the sun rises.
0.68 	 With all the time in the world, you'd think he'd have done a better job, or fixed the place up a bit.
0.59 	 Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene, fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine guns with wild abandon, and then silently leave.
0.83 	 **Possible Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />	Jason (a.k.a.
0.92 	 The mansion's exterior was allegedly filmed at Tarrytown's Lyndhurst estate; the lab scenes were apparently shot in somebody's basement.
0.92 	 The bandaged head is kept alive on "lab equipment" that's almost cheap-looking enough for Ed Wood.
0.99 	 Some of the library musicÂthe movie's high pointÂlater turned up in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH.
0.83 	 Meanwhile, the good doc prowls strip joints looking for a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle.
0.98 	 The ending, in uncut prints, features some ahead-of-its-time splatter and dismemberment when the zucchini-headed monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a welcome close.
1.0 	 This thing took three years to be released and then, audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved.
0.99 	 Between this, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a few others, 1959 should have been declared The Year Of The Turkey.
0.95 	 I'm looking forward to bringing him a copy.<br /><br />Currently the film's average rating is 1.9/10.
0.95 	 Best/Worst gift ever?
0.96 	 The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that portion of his life.
0.98 	 It ends as Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets to Havana.
0.67 	 It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.<br /><br />When I realized this was supposed to be an "epic" (I never knew *anything* but the title before it started), I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all, David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.
0.92 	 This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role).
0.98 	 While del Toro's terrific, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc.
0.68 	 When top aides of Che are killed, you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are.
0.98 	 What was his motivation?
0.66 	 Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mystery man of Arabia.
0.95 	 But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness, Quinn).
0.99 	 He was as courageous as he was insecure -- i.e., had human qualities.
0.82 	 Che is like a machine, about as warm as The Terminator.<br /><br />Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongol.
1.0 	 Che makes Mongol look like It's a Wonderful Life.
0.94 	 I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin.
0.99 	 The music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story.
0.84 	 Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while.
0.88 	 My rating 2/10
0.95 	 Terrible's House of Horrible; Garth Marenghi's Darkplace; The Mighty Boosh; Snuff Box.
0.93 	 The make up and prosthetics are so good I actually thought I watching a lot more actors on the show than there were.
0.97 	 No explanation given.
0.83 	 It's that creepy.
0.99 	 I recently viewed Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival.
0.84 	 I was drawn to the movie as a photographer because I'm both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work.
1.0 	 Obviously one reason for this is the extensive use of still photographs featuring zooms and pans across them.
0.69 	 While this is a good effect when used economically, I felt like 75% of the movie was just stills from Burtynsky's book (which I already own).
0.97 	 This could be a cute movie for kids My grandson watched it once.
0.92 	 Should be child friendly.
0.69 	 Although 18 different international directors took the challenge, not everyone of them is good, some of them even boring.
1.0 	 Here's a resumÃ© (I'll try to make at as spoiler-free as possible) of the 18 different stories.<br /><br />MONTMARTRE - kind of a dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it.
0.56 	 A man finds a parking spot, and sees a lot of odd couples walking by, wondering why he can't find a girl.
1.0 	 And than, suddenly, a woman faints next to his car...<br /><br />QUAIS DE SEINE - another dull sequence, about three teenage boys who are searching for some 'piece of ass', when suddenly a Muslim girl trips right in front of them, receiving help from one of the boys.
0.77 	 It's the story of an Hispanic woman who drops her child off, early in the morning, to take care of another suburban baby.
0.99 	 Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic,... Place des FÃªtes will make everyone cry.<br /><br />PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new thrills in their relationship... very unfunny and unromantic, Pigalle is a let-down.<br /><br />QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some diversity in the movie, QdlM is a relief.
0.86 	 Nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors.<br /><br />14TH ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time.
0.99 	 Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program.
0.91 	 I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't recognised it, when they use phrases like: "Who is Heaton?
0.99 	 What's he doing with a retard like Spike?"
0.93 	 This person, however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark.
0.61 	 Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, although I don't think this person has realised this, as he seems to be using the word "retard" as a derogatory term.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film.
0.74 	 Although it is not for the faint hearted.
0.54 	 If you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors, this is the film for you.
0.83 	 Essentially, things just kind-of happen.
0.91 	 Eric Seaver doesn't evolve at all.
0.51 	 Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice.
0.86 	 As the body count mounted, people in the theater started cheering "Kill her!
0.78 	 And in the end, that's all that really matters.
0.96 	 They were so sad, it seemed.
0.52 	 Homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another.
0.73 	 Dress was accurate and they had their slang down too.
0.77 	 Definitely recommend this movie!
0.99 	 I can't say too much about Kalifornia as sadly I have yet to actually see the whole thing (I've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on Fuse.)
0.99 	 Sadly I have yet to see the end, but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good, but disappointing.
1.0 	 I have to admit that I wish David Duchovany's (sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect) was a bit flat but for him it was okay.
0.59 	 I mean, maybe it's because I can relate a bit, I'm not sure.
0.99 	 I don't think I've ever seen a terrible Pitt movie or if I have it's not because of his acting it's other factors.
0.95 	 This movie was not one of them.
0.97 	 I swear I'm not just some random I do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking, I mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means!
0.74 	 <br /><br />At any rate I wish I could say more, but that's all I can really say without having seen the ending, I have seen most of the movie through what I've caught on Fuse and as I'm writing this I'm taping it on DVR so hopefully I can write a more complete review later.
0.97 	 That's what it is, without the fun.
0.86 	 This film has it's good points, but none of those are in the film.
0.92 	 I understand that many of the "zombies" helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies, which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world.
0.59 	 Has it been marketed properly?<br /><br />
0.98 	 Further Deponent Saith Not.
0.71 	 I know I've personally run into this many times.
0.9 	 People, don't do it.
0.99 	 An hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause.
0.96 	 Personally, I wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie.
0.94 	 I was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn.
0.9 	 I decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same.
0.96 	 Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent, Beckettian account of one of Dante's circles of hell, frankly.
0.97 	 At the centre of it is Ray Winstone, who has done this sort of character before but never as well.
0.95 	 The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie.
0.51 	 4/10
0.96 	 I have to say that this movie, although having very good FX, better then I expected, was NOT a good movie.
0.94 	 I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all.
0.91 	 I have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood.
0.74 	 The real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous (but still somewhat better) film.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh.
0.96 	 This cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers.
0.85 	 It's not meant to replace the Scooby gang it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers I'm sure.
0.89 	 Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support the creators/writers and producers so that this won't be the last Scooby Cartoon.
0.92 	 The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit, but never raunchy or tedious.
0.73 	 <br /><br />I've met people like those in the film while playing church ball.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Kurt Hale, and Halestorm entertainment, has made some good films, but this is not one of them.
0.87 	 The plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book (but really how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a film version first?
0.68 	 I know of only a few).
0.9 	 YES the law is drawn VERY badly in Bleak House.
0.87 	 It fails the descendants of Jarndyce whose valuable inheritance is eaten up by the costs of litigation, it fails the deceased Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and all who have faith in the suit.
0.94 	 It fails Miss Flyte.
0.5 	 In some sense it also fails Captain Hawdon who is driven to his death by the monotony of law copyist work.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Also, the law, while misused by Tulkinghorn and the Chancery vultures, is actually the source of security for the wards of the Court Ada and Richard, and for Esther who is simply Jarndyce's ward.
0.51 	 Neither are you supposed to "get" all the connections immediately.
1.0 	 Instant gratification just doesn't happen in Dickens.<br /><br />As for "seeing clearly" through the fog - gosh the Gillian Anderson had such scatty editing that I found IT impossible to follow and I knew the plot already!<br /><br />I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant (overacting and drama don't make a good Lady Dedlock but if you think they do try the Gillian Anderson version).<br /><br />It's ADA and Rick not "Kate"!
0.89 	 and you get all you need of the Rouncewell subplot.
0.8 	 Her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman, as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such.
0.9 	 At first glance, this film looks like the Keifer Sutherland series 24 for the big screen.
0.83 	 But Garrison gets implicated in the assassination plot, and has to run for his life while at the same time doing his bit of investigations into the plot.
0.81 	 While Eastwood's movie has a more enigmatic villain in John Malkovich, The Sentinel suffered from its lack of a central strong villain, preferring to share the assassination responsibility amongst many forgettable ex-KGB villains, and the mole within the Presidential Detail.
0.65 	 We know the reason why they're in the movie, and that is to get their fans into the theatres.
0.83 	 It's a decent suspense and investigative thriller, with enough subplots to keep you entertained.
0.59 	 But one thing though, like most ending action sequences, this one has a big enough loophole for you to fly a jumbo jet through.
0.87 	 They hit the nail on the head with this one.
0.59 	 Ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time.
0.93 	 I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that I don't believe were granted by anything Holy.
0.96 	 There is just nothing fit to watch on TV anymore.
0.98 	 This is because anything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from TV.
0.88 	 So, in the meantime, I'll just keep buying DVD sets and watching shows that should still be on TV but were booted off TV by religious zealots so we could watch "quality" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).
0.87 	 It has its merit's; Morvern Callar is both the merits and the disappointments.
0.99 	 She's so enigmatic, so original.
0.86 	 Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un-relatable?
0.93 	 Or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary?
0.51 	 Disposing of her boyfriend, not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she selfishly splashes out on a trip to Spain.
1.0 	 The only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her.
0.99 	 The short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min.
0.68 	 length, consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel.
0.99 	 The 2006 version is not only the worst of these three, but the worst of all Jane Eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film.
1.0 	 The novel's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones, and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel.
0.61 	 What it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the Rochester and Jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book, but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set.
1.0 	 It is a silly soap opera, in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake.
0.99 	 At times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen, and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by Jane's voice-overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess.
0.6 	 Thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech, while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s language.
1.0 	 THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook as the Israeli defence force come across a terrorist base .
0.91 	 This is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script , it grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon as he rents a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who`s not who he says he is .
0.98 	 I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE WITCHES' MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las brujas)is something like the 17th movie in the set.<br /><br />The movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all.
0.81 	 The characters were unsympathetic.<br /><br />The best scene is the beginning, with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter.
0.97 	 However, the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie, is the lead character, Mario, who has the most stupendous mustache ever.
0.81 	 Definitely Medieval-era (though I don't think any specific year is ever given).
0.89 	 Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns.
0.97 	 We see a horse gelded, a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig-sty, the pious torture of a young nun.
0.74 	 Through it all, Flavia observes and questions, rejecting, eventually, the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic.
0.95 	 I disagree with that criticism.
0.93 	 Flavia's views, though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror, for example, then-contemporary feminist commentary (the movie was made in 1974), revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions.
0.99 	 It is, perhaps, difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time, but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to belabor.
0.88 	 Not a mass-audience movie at all, to be sure.
0.99 	 It's quite good, though, and doesn't belong on the "nunsploitation" pile on which it is often carelessly thrown.
0.9 	 The Hamiltons tells the story of the four Hamilton siblings, teenager Francis (Cory Knauf), twins Wendell (Joseph McKelheer) & Darlene (Mackenzie Firgens) & the eldest David (Samuel) who is now the surrogate parent in charge.
0.83 	 The Hamilton's move house a lot, Franics is unsure why& is unhappy with the way things are.
0.63 	 The fact that his brother's & sister kidnap, imprison & murder people in the basement doesn't help relax or calm Francis' nerves either.
0.7 	 Is that really supposed to shock us?
0.94 	 Is a harmless looking young boy the best 'twist' ending that the makers could come up with?
0.99 	 The script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror & it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective.
0.94 	 The film is neither scary & since it's got a very middle-class suburban setting there's zero atmosphere or mood.
0.6 	 Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying.
0.88 	 To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.<br /><br />(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me.
0.89 	 And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the "in your face" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating.
0.85 	 One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.)
0.99 	 <br /><br />As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good.
0.74 	 Indeed the under-explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and, for at least the opening half, this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can.
0.88 	 This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack, but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower.
0.55 	 The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin.
0.99 	 The big 4 engine transport seen after the title "Honolulu 1944" appears to be the post war C-97 Stratofreighter (in MATS colors).
0.97 	 The combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are Douglas Skyraiders which entered service after WW2 and were made famous by their service in Vietnam.<br /><br />But excepting these two pieces of film and, of course, the hairstyles, everything else is very possibly period authentic.
1.0 	 I'm an admirer of Stanley Donen, we share the same birthday.
0.58 	 In his co directed ON THE TOWN (1949) there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949/50 Ford's yet there isn't the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a WW2 period film.
0.6 	 It just feels that way.
1.0 	 Based on a wartime Broadway musical which was based on a ballet (Fancy Free) which may have been based on the work of artist Paul Cadmus (The Fleet's In!
0.99 	 1934) its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in New York and, so heavy with wartime associations, its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell.<br /><br />The first problem is old Cary Grant.
0.93 	 Though far too old to represent a Navy SBD dive bomber pilot, it is a Hollywood tradition for stars like Grant, Gary Cooper (Lou Gehrig), Jimmy Stewart (Charles Lindbergh) to play younger.
0.87 	 He plays an operator, as they used to call them.
1.0 	 A guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it.
0.97 	 A hustler.
0.61 	 A wheeler dealer.
0.89 	 A de rigueur character in a service comedy.
0.87 	 Grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style.<br /><br />Thinking back on the great Grant comic performances like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or ARSENIC AND OLD LACE (1944) and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly.
0.86 	 IN KISS THEM he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just isn't him.
0.98 	 People had already been exposed to the type, most recently to comic Phil Silvers as Sgt.
0.58 	 Bilko on television.
0.61 	 There can be no more echt 50s women than Suzy Parker and Jayne Mansfield.
1.0 	 They are unique to the decade.
0.88 	 Suzy Parker was THE model who revolutionized the model business, who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera (see FUNNY FACE (1957) also by Stanley Donen).<br /><br />Of course in high 50s style, there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at 'wild' parties but never even a hint of sex (think of the 50s TV shows Bachelor Father or The Bob Cummings Show where dinner jacketed men returned from 'dates' alone).
0.98 	 A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China.
0.92 	 Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer).
1.0 	 A good wife, many children and land are the best things for men to have.
0.79 	 They are seen as property and investment.
0.99 	 Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience.
1.0 	 O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with.
0.89 	 On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance, showing his talent ones again.
1.0 	 This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of Chinese culture and traditions.
0.87 	 Story of a good-for-nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music.
0.98 	 Director Danny Boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost, in this film, the edge for creating inspiring and funny films.
0.75 	 It is not obvious from viewing this film (so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition.
1.0 	 But I am an intelligent and discerning human.
0.66 	 Just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, so, too, there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among Jews and Muslims.<br /><br />When you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand.
0.72 	 One grain will not be enough, you'll need more.
0.98 	 Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video.
0.75 	 There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a definite bias.
0.95 	 Be your own brain.
0.8 	 This allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script.
0.84 	 There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script.
0.52 	 Before Sunrise is what it is.
0.99 	 That is it: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationship.
0.71 	 I for one really like this movie for some reasons I'll go into late but I want to touch on why I think people don't like it.
0.82 	 I don't understand it really.
0.98 	 Surely one of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history â especially since the promise of its tag-line, âThe most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all timeâ, isnât even properly exploited!
0.86 	 ; for the record, he later starred in two ATOR movies (or would-be CONAN imitators) for Joe DâAmato and the King Arthur-era set, SWORD OF THE VALIANT (1984).<br /><br />When still an actor, director John Derek (who also serves as his own cinematographer here) had worked with some good film-makers (Cecil B.
0.51 	 !
0.91 	 This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment.
0.72 	 The cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time, hence the name 'fraidy cat'.
0.65 	 <br /><br />i watched this movie almost every day as a child :o)
0.98 	 His office thrusts upon him his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job.
0.99 	 And that job ain't very fun.
0.8 	 Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on his "flock" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement.
0.95 	 But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't.
0.99 	 Erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts.
0.83 	 It is this "good justification" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out-of-touch he's become (by being too close to his job).<br /><br />When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll's "area", he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock.
0.99 	 Is Erroll that good at his job?
0.99 	 Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back.
1.0 	 I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the Erroll character very well.
0.93 	 Battling retirement.
0.79 	 Worried about everyone who's near his flock.
0.7 	 Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere.
0.84 	 But that suspension has limits.
0.99 	 The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes.
0.83 	 Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no-no.
0.63 	 Whack!!!
0.99 	 He kills his father and friends.
0.81 	 About 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school.
0.87 	 There he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her.
1.0 	 Only Ms. Hartman did a great job.
0.99 	 Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one!
0.51 	 !
0.83 	 Sadly, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with an inferior Sinatra showpiece.
0.84 	 Marlon Brando can't sing worth beans, but pulls it off anyway.
0.52 	 I know nothing of the Iliad so can not comment on it's accuracy to that story.
0.97 	 This film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings/walls impressive.
0.7 	 Females are forbidden to go to stadium by law in Iran, although many of them dress like boys and sneak in.
0.61 	 10 out of 10.
1.0 	 She's both wanton, and criminally conspiratorial.
0.98 	 A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular.
0.67 	 It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />If that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is.
0.91 	 It's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted.
0.72 	 Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white.
0.86 	 Still, I mostly hated this.<br /><br />The film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace.
0.99 	 <br /><br />His talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete.
0.93 	 Unless you're very interested in the Harlem Renaissance there's no reason to see this.
0.7 	 All I've said are just only some of the good points of this movie.
0.99 	 Now, I don't want to belittle their sufferÃ­ngs, but I sure would like to make a comparison.
1.0 	 The number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and I say this with all due respect, blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion.<br /><br />Fact is: People die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people.
0.57 	 So, what I am saying is this: The reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11.
1.0 	 The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky.
0.73 	 What they have done is taken a TV show, which was never aimed at young children & given it the George Lucas treatment (i.e.
0.87 	 There's one particular scene I could watch over and over (and I have!
0.97 	 I cried, I laughed and I sighed.
0.78 	 I'd recommend this film to anyone.
0.86 	 They don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to.
0.96 	 How do we know they aren't in love?
0.7 	 I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.<br /><br />The movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing.
0.94 	 This movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike Cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.
1.0 	 There are many other better romantic comedies, even ones with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />If you think this movie is great, try these movies, you hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or There's Something About Mary (which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today's society).
0.93 	 Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon.
0.77 	 This isn't necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet.
0.97 	 So, it's up to the good scientists of the US (led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us--and especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path!
0.87 	 Overall, a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like--all others, see it at your own risk.
1.0 	 Doesn't one of the most endearing Disney creations at least deserve a linear story?
0.99 	 Of these three, only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect.
0.55 	 Why does everything have to be updated?
1.0 	 You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style?
1.0 	 Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we'll get music inspired by Britney Spears!!!
0.84 	 Such movies may be entertaining, but they need some substance, to do so.
0.99 	 It's as if a FranÃ§ois Truffaut plot were directed by Dick Cheney...<br /><br />Brazil, some other classic SF movies?
0.6 	 It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context.
0.9 	 Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol.
0.85 	 And of course he knows how to play the system.
0.53 	 Does that sound familiar.
0.6 	 It's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment.
1.0 	 The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this.
0.95 	 I know I did.
0.69 	 He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990.
0.59 	 When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories.<br /><br />The movie constantly plays with time.
0.93 	 For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call.
0.85 	 I have spoken of taste in another review, saying it's all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film, if you like it, it simply means you have bad taste.<br /><br />I love films.
0.74 	 I loved "Isle of the Dead" which is pretty much an unknown B&W film.
0.95 	 I even liked "Scream" and "Scary Movie" I liked these films because they have, if not a lot, at least something good about them.
0.94 	 I appreciate 99.9% of the films I've seen because they tell a story which I haven't heard before, and most directors only make films with a good storyline.
0.98 	 Just "My GOD."
0.99 	 In "Fight Club" there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where Tyler's true identity was cryptically shown, and when you watched it again you saw more, it really was a work of genius, how it was written, laid out and directed.
0.98 	 Its like the CI2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever.
0.78 	 I haven't seen "American Psycho II" yet, but no doubt his laid back "cool" style has ruined that film also.<br /><br />I can't even say it is a good film for teens, as its not.
0.99 	 I'm disappointed that some have said "you might not be in the age bracket for this film, and so dislike it" I like all the films now that I liked as a teen and had very good taste.
0.99 	 I liked "Mean Girls" and other generic teen films, and watch "Beverly Hills 90210" all the time.
0.83 	 Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk.
0.5 	 And, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them.
0.51 	 Traci Lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business-couple intending to poison the world with antrax.
0.69 	 Original in this movie is the bra-bomb, put on a captured member of the D.R.E.A.M.-team.
0.91 	 Of course she is rescued by a co-member, three seconds before explosion.
0.87 	 I describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together.
0.93 	 then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin the karate kid.
0.91 	 There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love Eli Roth, even that did not make me like this film.
0.9 	 Hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do.
0.99 	 BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2!!!!
0.51 	 !
0.97 	 For my money, there is no comparison between the two.
0.65 	 What a loss the passing of director Emile Ardolino was!
0.56 	 He could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star.
0.98 	 A huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the deer's antler's is broken.
0.81 	 He then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them.
1.0 	 Kitty (Julie Christie) is vacuous and snobbish.
0.84 	 Why, she asks herself, was this other woman sent a telegraph about Chris rather than her?
0.65 	 Chris has forgotten totally about Kitty.
0.67 	 Telling Chris this, weighs the Shrink, will certainly restore him to 'normal.'
0.54 	 But is this a good idea?
0.56 	 Chris, barely aware that he and Kitty were ever married, is unaware of his child and the child's death.
0.55 	 The psychiatrist, just learning of the child, believes such knowledge will restore Chris.
0.52 	 Jenny and Margaret have Chris all to themselves because Kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept Chris's illness in reverting to his youth in his forties.
0.85 	 She does not reveal this to Margaret, however.
0.51 	 The buoyant war victim's head sinks, his shoulders slump, he looks away.
0.96 	 He walks dejectedly toward the house.
0.77 	 Fin<br /><br />I read some criticism of this first novel of Rebecca West.
0.71 	 The novel was written something after the first war.
1.0 	 The criticism doesn't make it clear either.
0.97 	 The effects fit with the script.
0.59 	 sort of way.
0.77 	 Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.<br /><br />Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...Cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised.
0.75 	 It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.<br /><br />If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events...or does it?
0.99 	 Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'Munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'Don Quixote'.
0.65 	 It certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved.
0.52 	 Gilliam's description of the film as his "7Â½th" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's portrayal of Goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic.
1.0 	 It's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure.
0.53 	 First the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode.
0.71 	 McCoy and Spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past.
0.88 	 Kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while Spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.<br /><br />Spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives McCoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out.
1.0 	 Anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind.
0.91 	 Leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching.
0.99 	 In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands.
0.98 	 Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor.
0.98 	 Then comes the sequel.<br /><br />Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first.
0.71 	 A movie for youngsters, let's say up to 13 years old.
0.56 	 I thought it was a film school project.
0.92 	 If you are going to get an "R" for violence, you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked.
0.61 	 "<br /><br />And, I am staying out of Oakland.
0.77 	 Shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up?
0.98 	 once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on here.<br /><br />Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter didn't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me.
0.78 	 Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that didn't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses.<br /><br />The ending is weak.
0.78 	 If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons.
0.84 	 I cry every time I see Shadow yelling "Wait, wait for me Peter!"
0.76 	 as the family car is pulling away.
1.0 	 The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid.
0.75 	 Like when Sassy says to Chance; "Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"
0.83 	 The storyline may seem hooky to some, but I like it.
0.66 	 I didn't expect it to entertain and amuse as well, or as strongly, as it did.
0.89 	 It seems to be missing.
0.59 	 I'd buy it.<br /><br />Even with more action, this is still not an action flick.
0.51 	 !
0.6 	 For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick.
0.73 	 You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach.
0.61 	 And there was a lot of that, believe me.
0.77 	 Thank G_d it bombed, or we might get treated to such delights as "Skate Fu" where we can see the likes of Brian Boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but I digress.
0.99 	 The flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them.
0.77 	 I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this.
0.79 	 And though the focus is on war's heinous tattoo on children, the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear.
0.95 	 These wide-eyed children become adults, carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds.<br /><br />We then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium.
0.95 	 Tur (Bruno Bergonzini) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to Catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion.
0.65 	 Francisca (AntÃ²nia Torrens) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium.
0.98 	 Roy Thinnes plays undercover agent Diamond Head (Mr. Head, to you), working for his G-Man handler "Aunt Mary", looking for "Tree", who's on a mission to...well, just watch the movie.
0.88 	 As the boys and various reviewers have pointed out, the movie "Fargo" had more Hawaiian locations than this film.
0.97 	 The others were John Badham (War Games), and a young fellow named Steven Spielberg...
0.96 	 He's referred to as "a drunk and a nut."
0.84 	 He asks for a second drink, and, though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen, his hair is a bit long and tousled.
0.98 	 That's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut.
0.86 	 The soles of Jimmy Stewart's shoes are barely scuffed.<br /><br />And the Zodiac Club, where the witches hang out.
0.88 	 It's called "a low dive."
0.89 	 That is not my idea or yours of a "low dive" -- not even for Greenwich Village in 1958.
0.55 	 I mean, Kim Novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet.
0.53 	 She glides rather than walks, a wispy presence.
0.69 	 Her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic French curves.
1.0 	 Who could resist laughing when Hermione Gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of Novak's spell?
1.0 	 It's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming.
0.63 	 There was never anything quite like The Ernie Kovacks Show before -- or after.
0.99 	 And he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of Percy Dovetail, an effete poet.
0.73 	 Conte was later a member of Doc Severison's band on Johnny Carson's Late Show.<br /><br />The third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more "romantic" than "comedy".
1.0 	 But it's never dull.
0.79 	 The whole film rolls along as neatly as Van Druten's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Then of course, all hell breaks loose.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro (whom I like) blurbs were uninformative, unnecessary, and didn't advance the story at all.
0.61 	 9.5 out of 10.
0.5 	 i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it.
0.51 	 UNfunny.
0.53 	 We do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema, or any other language or medium.
0.65 	 I've been trying to find out about this series for ages!
0.93 	 But - Why is it not better known?
0.57 	 And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD?
0.85 	 I still remember one of the opening lines...."Tutazema was his name, and he was an Orphan.
0.78 	 At the end the other Indian boys in the village attach the feathers to Tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself.
0.98 	 In Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry.
1.0 	 Despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, Richard Brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story.
0.67 	 This is the first problem with the TV remake --color changes the tone of the story.
0.99 	 In addition, the confinement of shooting a film for TV makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused.
0.62 	 As a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment, and execution) so claustrophobic.
0.63 	 <br /><br />Hollywood's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age.
0.77 	 It's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument.
0.6 	 It doesn't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward Smith and Hickock that the original film provokes.
0.96 	 At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling: "Ho hum, who cares?
0.66 	 "<br /><br />See the original first, on as large a screen as you can, then watch the TV version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967.<br /><br />Wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about Capote and the original book.
0.99 	 Why didn't Dynamo have any pants?!
0.67 	 Where did they go??
0.96 	 It was never explained.
0.62 	 Great acting too.
0.69 	 I tried to give this movie the "stinkeye" but it continued playing.
0.99 	 What am I doing wrong???!!!!
0.89 	 I thought the "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol ;) I would like that for a show.
0.99 	 Why wasn't Dynamo wearing pants.
0.99 	 I know his arm WAS skewered but... What's up with those crazy futur nets.
0.65 	 He could have used one.
1.0 	 Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse.
0.99 	 My son is so jaded with current "B" Science Fiction that he hasn't bothered seeing this yet.<br /><br />It must be noted I didn't see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia.
0.9 	 This is also no B movie.
0.98 	 In any case the affects are secondary.<br /><br />I won't give anything away about the plot.
0.97 	 The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect, it's a tad off key.
0.99 	 He was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him.
0.72 	 And believe me a 20 year old Lorenzo in tight jeans you really don't want to miss!
0.95 	 Tea Leoni?
0.76 	 Ryan O'Neal?
0.6 	 Richard Schiff?
0.75 	 30 minutes in I was having trouble staying awake.
0.79 	 Finished watching it the next morning.
0.73 	 What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Day in the Life..." Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie.
0.72 	 Continuity non-existent.
0.62 	 The story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions.
1.0 	 The cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented.
0.65 	 Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft-core porn.
0.7 	 It literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception...I can't believe they'd make a third one.
0.97 	 White man + progress + industrialization = BAD.
0.98 	 Actually, in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it.
0.62 	 However, that being said, I think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone.
0.99 	 You may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won, er lost.
0.93 	 (The movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there).
0.62 	 Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the very last of the series, and like part 4, it's unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that it's a Christmas-themed horror flick.<br /><br />Except to the oblivious, there's some obvious things going on here...Mickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and his creepy son's name is Pino.
0.89 	 Now, a little boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one evening, and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him.
0.9 	 Even though it said "don't open till Christmas", he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself.
0.65 	 Of course Derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs, but he doesn't grow up to be some killer Santa, he just stops talking.<br /><br />There's a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes.
0.99 	 We even see him buying a bunch when Derek's mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma.
0.9 	 Well, we're not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick.
0.99 	 And the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too, and there's even kind of a happy ending of sorts.
0.56 	 Whee.<br /><br />A step up from part 4, but not much of one.
0.89 	 Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great.
1.0 	 For example, the facts relating to his death are totally fabricated and bear no relationship to the truth.
0.56 	 These web sites can be located by using any good search engine.
0.82 	 Soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are, it's a conspiracy to make him crazy, or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl.
0.87 	 Yes, definitely better than my viewing of Death Tunnel.
0.9 	 When the "kids" (high school or college?)
0.79 	 I find it humorous when I see those horror movies from the 80's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram.<br /><br />4.)
0.51 	 5.)
0.8 	 And hes so psychic that he couldn't even see his OWN death?
0.53 	 6.)
0.5 	 7.)
0.67 	 So the lesson is if you ARE like Shae and don't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film, you'll be the one to live?
0.52 	 9.)
0.51 	 11.)
0.7 	 Shae beat that one, but never encountered any more of them.<br /><br />12.)
0.92 	 What was with the flashbacks to those other people?
0.51 	 13.)
0.51 	 14.)
0.51 	 15.
0.74 	 The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas' novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdi's opera La Traviata.
0.84 	 This all is very good, but look carefully: HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB!
0.58 	 I got lured by the title...
0.94 	 While Rick Baker's special effects are quite impressive (if stomach-turning), it has no other redeeming features.
0.56 	 When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a guy jumps up and announces that Colbert CAN'T get married because she already is married!!
0.51 	 Colbert insists this isn't true, but when they investigate they find that the Justice of the Peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license!
1.0 	 However, in spite of this, the film was so good, I can even excuse the limp ending.
0.71 	 An innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the President of the United States, the first traitor in the United States Secret Service.
0.99 	 This thankfully wasn't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films.<br /><br />The films director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T.)
0.76 	 Although many have criticized it as "should have been a TV movie", I must disagree.
0.64 	 WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (but not really - keep reading).
0.89 	 Ahhh, there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that I won't have room to list them all.
0.98 	 Against all vain fears to the contrary, Celeste wins again.
0.98 	 Well, nguh..." The reason for Adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot, and we're instantly off on a trip with Celeste's neuroses.
0.53 	 Such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor Lorenzo Lamas, son of aforementioned Fernando Lamas (d. 1982).<br /><br />Those who can remember the economics teacher (Ben Stein) in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) as he deadeningly calls the roll ("Bueller.
0.6 	 Bueller.
0.98 	 Bueller"), will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer.
0.98 	 Somehow they work out the logical difficulties, and Geoffrey Anderson steps off the choo-choo.<br /><br />Celeste can now only get worse, and her trick of going across the Washington bridge no longer helps.
1.0 	 First, her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara, but she soon degenerates into a stalker.
0.97 	 Unfortunately, she cannot get rid of Geoffrey Anderson so easily.
0.65 	 "I'm not going back to Florida no-how!
0.88 	 ", argues Geoffrey.
0.95 	 "You try playing Willie Loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !"
0.99 	 He was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his TV with a shoe, and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer.
0.98 	 -You'll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable, farcically malicious riot.<br /><br />And you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted Geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the TelePrompter.
0.98 	 A draw with Blazing Saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value, although otherwise dissimilar.
0.88 	 Watch it and weep.
0.61 	 10 out of 10.
0.96 	 Many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies, but this movie is no where near that.
0.98 	 Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor.
1.0 	 This bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie.
1.0 	 Barbara Bach, the Bond Girl from "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three brief scenes.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.99 	 Paul (Brad Pitt) was a misfit from the offset, and lived on the edge...You would think that Montana in the 1920's had no such thing, yet somehow, gambling, drinking, and violent confrontations, were as much a part of Paul, as was his fly fishing rod!!
0.79 	 Fly fishing!!
0.93 	 Did I say that?
0.6 	 For Norman, his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook, and precarious resolve!
0.98 	 The murky waters of Montana's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth!!
0.9 	 The version I saw of this film was the Blockbuster rental with a similar title, but a swear word in it.<br /><br />This film was funny as hell.
0.52 	 It was also true to the bone.
0.87 	 The only downside was Carmen Electra but we can't have everything.
0.78 	 Words can hardly describe it, so I'll be brief.
0.52 	 I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.<br /><br />Rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film.
0.99 	 It isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted.
0.82 	 I can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite.
0.98 	 If you don't get it, perhaps you haven't lived enough, or something else is wrong with you.
0.86 	 I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a "thumbs in the middle" review, remarking that I'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode.
0.65 	 I've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006.
0.58 	 Everything.
0.9 	 Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system?
1.0 	 The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the "Think Thank Thunk" episode with the quiz show.
0.57 	 That was the single-worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read.
0.99 	 Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc.
0.81 	 era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days.
0.95 	 Remember Whoopi Goldberg at the shredding machine?
0.94 	 Whoopi zonked out tranquilizers?
0.96 	 But there's only the whisper of a plot here and you can't wait for it to Get Moving.
0.72 	 Ulli Lommel's 1980 film 'The Boogey Man' is no classic, but it's an above average low budget chiller that's worth a look.
0.78 	 One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled 'Return of the Boogey Man.'
0.74 	 Though the opening title is 'Boogey Man 3,' this is no sequel to those two far superior films I named above.
0.74 	 Well, not totally anyway.<br /><br />Pros: Ha!
0.72 	 That's a laugh.
0.82 	 Decisions, decisions.
0.96 	 The acting is stiff at best.
0.9 	 Suzanna Love's character was named Lacey, not Natalie!
0.99 	 But instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this.
0.58 	 If there ever is another sequel, which I doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.<br /><br />My rating: 1/5
0.54 	 Even, Dot was cute.
1.0 	 Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers.
0.91 	 I saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently, on one of those dollar DVD's that seem to be everywhere nowadays, and was so moved by it that I cannot contain myself.
0.9 	 (Ain't he the lucky one?)
0.86 	 The two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car.
0.91 	 He survives the wreck, and makes it home just in time for a full moon.
0.97 	 (Best guess.
0.78 	 Forget it, buddy.
0.82 	 If it's not even good for that, what the hell is it good for?
0.68 	 When I saw the commercial for this, I was all about seeing it.
0.8 	 I guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, I suppose) you may think this is some hot stuff.
0.76 	 The title refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wipes out everything.<br /><br />David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer hired to defend some Aborigines accused of murder.
0.6 	 Peter Weir created a perplexing, but thought-provoking, movie.
0.79 	 I would give The Man in the Moon 8.5/10
0.95 	 Billy Chung Siu Hung's (the bloody swordplay film Assassin from 1993) film Love To Kill (Hong Kong, 1993) is among the strongest products of the Category III boom that inhabited the HK cinema in early nineties.
0.94 	 Love To Kill definitely belongs to the "more" category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness.<br /><br />The HK psycho Anthony Wong (from the award winning The Untold Story by Herman Yau, from the same year) plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture, humiliate and rape his young wife (Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung) who for some reason doesn't leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor.
0.9 	 The imagery and happenings are something never found in the Western cinema, at least in mainstream, and it all becomes even more mind-blowing when some/most taboos for Westerners, like violence and perversions witnessed by a child, are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick, and that goes perfectly especially for this film too.<br /><br />The film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned Dr. Lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992.
1.0 	 Usually the music and soundtrack in HK films is interesting and adds to the imagery, especially in these terror films.
0.99 	 Also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes, especially in the finale, in blue colors and camera lenses (as does Assassin, too), and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera.
0.51 	 Still the film has the usual HK humor in it which makes the sick goings-on even sicker as some "humor" is thrown into the soup.
1.0 	 And that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy HK films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses.<br /><br />The film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of Wong's wife in various ways.
0.99 	 We also get to see some flashbacks from Wong's own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now.
1.0 	 These flashback scenes, mostly at the end of the film, include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up (for example the hits of an axe) and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene.
0.63 	 The ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails, for example, on his furious way.<br /><br />The film is also genuinely pretty "suspicious" in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should NEVER be taken as entertainment, mostly I mean rape.
0.99 	 Women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females.<br /><br />The other version I saw, the newly released DVD in HK (without subtitles) has this "table brutality" scene in a much longer form than the subtitled Taiwanese DVD which is otherwise identical to the HK version.
0.96 	 I've also heard that the old HK Laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film, it is impossible to say how "uncut" versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are.
0.98 	 Obviously plenty of footage has been cut out, possibly even before the theatrical release.<br /><br />The film is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin, the former having written also films like Dr. Lamb, The Untold Story and Gunmen (Kirk Wong, 1988) but out of his other films that I've seen, Love to Kill is the most gratuitous.
0.99 	 Dr. Lamb and The Untold Story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one.
0.99 	 The harrowing torture imagery of The Untold Story, the victim being the criminal, is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example.
1.0 	 But there's none of this in Love to Kill, it is just honest, calculated and fastly made exploitation which is, by the way, produced by a veteran director Kirk "Organized Crime & Triad Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993)" Wong!<br /><br />Love to Kill earns no more than 2/10 from me as I don't have too high appreciation on films like this.
0.81 	 (HK) Cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like Love to Kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art.
0.63 	 Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor.
1.0 	 "Country dance" is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released as such.
1.0 	 A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs, mating horses,porn (not suggested, its pretty full on for a film) & bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music & chase scenes thrown in, its sounds crazy & its even more so to watch.
0.79 	 It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.<br /><br />With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything.
0.74 	 Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines.
0.82 	 They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star.
1.0 	 Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i.e.
0.84 	 Towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score.
1.0 	 But that's just nitpicking.)
0.95 	 Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all.<br /><br />The film shows promise for Ustinov is released from prison for embezzling.
0.85 	 He convinces Robert Morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual duo for films.<br /><br />Morley sounds just as he did in 1938's "Marie Antoinette."
0.98 	 Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering Oscar performance in "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.
0.97 	 That's me...an old kazoo and some sparklers" or "But you are Blanche, you are in that chair!"
0.8 	 or "WITH ALL MY HEART, I STILL LOVE THE MAN I KILLED!!"...
0.8 	 I thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him, but then again, everyone was...except Mildred.
0.93 	 It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it like that) as well (just think about the dog in "How the Grinch stole Christmas"... it was plain bad training).
1.0 	 The story idea is excellent.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
1.0 	 The original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings.
0.99 	 Get hooked up with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such delights as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness, and Judge John Deed.
1.0 	 Watch the original Touching Evil, then look for "Wire in the Blood" for more of the truly understated, elegant performance of Robson Green.
0.98 	 Second time through you realize how horribly the sister's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar.
1.0 	 Meanwhile, all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies.
0.98 	 The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances.<br /><br />However..... <br /><br />The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy.
0.56 	 The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichÃ©s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front.
0.66 	 Got all that?
0.6 	 If you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak Japanese and don't have any subtitles.
0.94 	 It will certainly be something different.
0.93 	 Rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since Mira and Olivier where in it.
0.58 	 when is supposed to be a mystery movie.
0.69 	 <br /><br />For real what happened??
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 PROM NIGHT (2008)<br /><br />directed by: Nelson McCormick<br /><br />starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis<br /><br />plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her.
0.63 	 Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends.
0.51 	 I even like some PG-13 horror films.
0.97 	 TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG.
1.0 	 I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004).
0.95 	 At least they can be entertaining.
0.98 	 This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family.
1.0 	 I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders.
0.55 	 I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me.<br /><br />I also hated the characters.
0.9 	 There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male.
1.0 	 If this film strikes you (as it did us and, apparently, others departing the theater) as disappointingly thin, it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing.
1.0 	 Page, an aspiring actress, progressing through degrees of progressively less "bad" auditions and student acting scenes is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft.<br /><br />The script does effectively bring us into 1950's America, where childhood sexual abuse, lawless abduction and rape, and the legal suppression of brands of pornography which today seem laughably tame, is a reality.
0.58 	 The rest of the story is like THE THING, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff is hunted and killed off as they try to formulate a way to escape and/or defeat the "Dragon."
0.89 	 Well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on.
0.99 	 All right, so you may disagree, perhaps it is a bit boring at times, I'm not an expert.
0.83 	 To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make.
0.99 	 Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star.
1.0 	 It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory.
0.99 	 Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup.
0.99 	 Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman.
0.92 	 But Brad Pitt has, singlehandedly, redefined the concept.
0.98 	 He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theatre to see "Troy" If you liked epics in the "Jupiter's Darling" style you may enjoy this.
0.87 	 But if you don't, go all the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
0.95 	 A real "Stinkeroo"!!!!
0.69 	 !<br /><br />A 0.2 out of 10!
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun).
0.64 	 Some parts are very reminiscant of "Hellraiser", but come off as tribute rather than imitation.
0.65 	 It's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile.
0.95 	 Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.
0.88 	 He is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him, not in spite of him.
0.75 	 Although released by RKO, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution.
1.0 	 The location shooting in New York City, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior "The Naked City", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever.
1.0 	 It is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.<br /><br />.
0.62 	 I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment.<br /><br />First of all, I don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to "The Jerk".
0.7 	 The question is why would he even want her back - from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with Bob - why wouldn't she do it again?<br /><br />The film is loaded with symbolism.
0.53 	 When an actor has to play the role of an actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role.
0.98 	 I would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored.
0.66 	 I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen.
0.98 	 Does this mean that the movie misses the mark?
0.89 	 Of course not.
0.99 	 In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page).
1.0 	 REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways.
0.57 	 <br /><br />Gotta find a copy somewhere...........
0.89 	 This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now.
0.64 	 Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie.
0.7 	 I have never seen anything like it.<br /><br />Murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks, pussy, tits and insaults so many famous people including his own "family".
0.86 	 I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life.
0.8 	 I mean, when a person doesn't know who Mr. T is, but still laughs so hard of Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it.
0.78 	 At the time I saw the show I couldn't remember who Mr T. was but still laughed.
0.96 	 I agree with most of the other guys.
0.99 	 The only highlight from my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio.
0.93 	 ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This reminds of old times with RTL Samstag Nacht.
0.75 	 It is hard to describe the performances of the actors, since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just "do their thing".
0.79 	 This might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong.
1.0 	 Hitler loved animals above people.
0.7 	 Utter lies.
0.54 	 He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time.<br /><br />There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece.
0.78 	 Never mind become the leader of Germany.<br /><br />Honestly, this film was utterly terrible.<br /><br />Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth.
0.65 	 for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, heres your chance, and then get back to the real world.<br /><br />The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch, so he gets transferred to another prison, where wrestling champs hang around looking broody.
0.89 	 The script gave us a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the "i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"
0.97 	 rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if -like so many TV soaps do.
0.85 	 <br /><br />The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary 'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an "artistic" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well!
0.95 	 <br /><br />Nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant.
0.88 	 I don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome.
0.63 	 Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty-boy.
0.6 	 I've read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast.
0.98 	 No, it does not in the least resemble Hollywood (thank God!
0.7 	 Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for.
0.6 	 <br /><br />My rating: 8 and a half
0.91 	 I saw this movie when Mystery Science Theater ran it in 1993.
0.99 	 It is the worst thing I've ever seen.
0.76 	 So bad in fact, that by sheer freakiness, this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed.
0.82 	 <br /><br />Whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten.
0.92 	 Creepy laughing wind-up reindeer?
0.99 	 <br /><br />There's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology.
0.79 	 There are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or RAF stars.
0.63 	 <br /><br />Notable, too, is the trial sequence Â which is entirely depicted through the audience's reaction so that judge, jury, witnesses and D.A.
0.53 	 The centerpiece of the film is the scene in which Gomez and Tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved, with the inspector's put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug Tone "dizzy spells".
0.9 	 The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.<br /><br />The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.<br /><br />Pacing: everything happens too quickly.
0.52 	 For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start can do back-flips, etc.
0.99 	 Why is she so acrobatic?
0.96 	 Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as "Power Rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "Robot Jox".
0.99 	 A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins.
0.98 	 The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch.
0.75 	 So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.
1.0 	 Hilary's acting was, I found, the most stilted.
0.8 	 Just as he is settling down, William is recalled back to London by his mother, and it is here we see why he is so screwed up.
0.69 	 I caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and I'm glad I did.
0.97 	 They are used as sacrificial mules in a heroin smuggling ring.
0.99 	 Joel schumacher Made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script.
0.71 	 Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized, I do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older, but her face is weird.
0.99 	 The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works.
0.87 	 (In the interest of full disclosure, I've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief, but extremely pivotal, role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse) Not a great film nor a good one, but serviceable enough.
0.7 	 How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work... no matter the conditions, else his reason for living ceases.
0.88 	 When you see his failures, energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon.
0.98 	 He discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same.
0.76 	 When he says he needs the earth, but it does not need him ...
0.6 	 I had a really hard time making it through this move.
0.88 	 Strange enough, all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over.
0.97 	 I mean, it's so hilarious it just has to be made!"
0.99 	 A famous theatre director (Hilmir SnÃ¦r GuÃ°nason), becoming blind after a car accident, is on the run for himself and his destiny.
0.55 	 (Blind persons are seeing with their fingers, nose and ears.)
0.64 	 The theatre director is on the road to his mother (Jenny GrÃ¶llmann).
0.97 	 His mother is living somewhere in Russia on the sea and making artistic installations - of course, what should she do other!
0.59 	 - and she is still living, because she is waiting his son, to die.
0.9 	 My God!
0.99 	 This are destinies!<br /><br />Finally the son arrived!
1.0 	 Mum is celebrating a big party!
0.89 	 Wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune.
1.0 	 Yes, they are celebrating her farewell.
0.91 	 The son arrives just in time.
1.0 	 Now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son, speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect German, while the son is answering with a rough accent.
0.98 	 - but is looking for Lilly on the way back to home.<br /><br />Parallel to this roadmovie the sister of Lilly, staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her, who has first to booze himself to courage.
0.92 	 The occasion is favourable.
1.0 	 Because Mum (Tina Engel) is on journey together with the lover of Lilly, Paul (Harald Schrott).
0.85 	 They are after Lilly, to bring her back.
0.72 	 The film script missed to make out of Paul something exceptional too.
0.78 	 I would suggest an architect or a Pianist, or course a famous one!
0.92 	 When they finally find Lilly, they want to convince her, to come back to Paul, because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her.
0.54 	 I have the impression, that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants.
0.92 	 Everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea.
1.0 	 Probably also Til Schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit, being a co-producer.
0.88 	 "Barfuss" DVD cover writes proudly: "A Til Schweiger Film".
0.99 	 There are really good films in Germany.
0.59 	 Watch out for film directors like Marcus H. RosenmÃ¼ller, Joseph Vilsmaier, Hans Steinbichler, Hans-Christian Schmid, Faith Akin ...
0.86 	 I've never seen an actor do that, ever.
0.93 	 Don't have any doubts on it, there is something there for all.
0.88 	 For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot' was much better.
0.64 	 For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was much better.
0.55 	 The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (`CrissCross' and `A World Apart' cannot even be compared with this one), and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `Queen Margot' for this movie (Attention to the end of the film).
0.92 	 Every character is shown in simple black and white terms: the good versus the evil.
0.85 	 Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end.
0.95 	 I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie.
0.7 	 and Inspector Morse).
0.79 	 When I look for new cars, I expect not to be shown boats.
0.97 	 When I watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist, I expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work.
0.98 	 It's wonderful when actors/actresses wish to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained.
0.82 	 Everybody deserves to screw up here and there.
0.63 	 The lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her.
0.88 	 Playing herself, she's stuck hosting monster movie shows but longs for her own show in Las Vegas and make big money.
0.91 	 Her agent Manny proves a disappointment.
0.99 	 The script is chalk full of all kinds of jokes, some bad, some good, lots of sexual innuendo, visual jokes and overall campiness i.e.
0.52 	 Why did they let these people do such a BAAAAAD movie there?<br /><br />When this movie was originally to be released...it was more of a romantic comedy...and no ROBO-anything.
0.98 	 That all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of Disney.
0.96 	 They did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character.
0.99 	 Seeing Matthew Broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either.
0.51 	 !
0.6 	 But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win.
0.85 	 His mom is dead!
0.74 	 O Sanders) how did he to that.
0.97 	 The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!)
0.8 	 I had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when I saw it.
0.63 	 and I can honestly say, that it's there.
1.0 	 Is that bad?
0.88 	 Not really.
0.73 	 Exaggerated?
0.72 	 Maybe.
0.74 	 Is it way "off mark?"
0.58 	 It depends on where you went to or go to school.
0.72 	 Minus the Hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me.
0.99 	 I was very excited about this film.
0.96 	 The acting styles ran the gamut from really, really, flat (the angels, the wife and daughter) to over-animated (Casper's character).
0.56 	 Pay special attention to the scene regarding "the bug".
0.74 	 I didn't feel like I was transported to exotic locations.
0.66 	 However, to end on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good.
1.0 	 I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers.
0.78 	 It is my opinion(and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower and the ACTION factor would have been greatly increased, this film would have been good.
0.87 	 This is potentially a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark.
0.74 	 I was about 11 years old i found out i live 0.48 miles from the uncle house.
0.9 	 the uncle house is on Westway Dr, deer park, TX.
0.75 	 they have added homes since the movie was made.
0.96 	 the bar on Spencer is no longer their.
0.66 	 My dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie.
0.94 	 where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher.
0.89 	 when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time.
0.76 	 Okay, so he found Simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her (even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously)?
0.93 	 ; I remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well, and I'm sorry to say it's no clearer now!
0.88 	 Mind you, the film's first two-thirds are pretty solid but I wish that Polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout.
0.58 	 Natalia's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film.
0.76 	 Hello.
0.97 	 Which i can agree, saw as well is also very graphic, but, i did like the movie saw.<br /><br />The scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen.
0.67 	 i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good.
0.96 	 FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY WATCHING ANIMALS BEATIN TO DEATH, LETTING ROT, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS WELL AND A FIVE MINUTE SCENE OF SOMEONE GETTING THERE HEAD SMASHED IN WITH A HAMMER then you will enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a higher budget film, like saw for example.
0.68 	 anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.
0.9 	 I am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out.
1.0 	 :(<br /><br />That said, it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers.
0.97 	 That's the beauty of the subjective art form of film.
0.51 	 :)
0.8 	 I always found Betsy Drake rather creepy, and this movie reinforces that.
0.71 	 It's no "North by Northwest"...
0.95 	 A good bulk of the extras in the film are then-drama students from NAU.
0.8 	 From the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited London for even 1 day will agree...was not London.
0.54 	 To the much unexplained way how Snipe's character managed to escape the country back to the US without a single problem.
0.92 	 Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America, how on earth did Grandma agree to that...he's an assassin!
1.0 	 We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars, I'm sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation, but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior.
0.64 	 We also have terrible American accents, a young girl who's posher than the Queen, but lives in Elephant & Castle.
0.99 	 I can fondly remember Bo Derek's heyday and the UK press attention (the mucky Sun & News of the World papers especially)- all following her small role in "10" with Dudley Moore.
0.5 	 Understandably, much fuss was made of her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts.
0.99 	 I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain DVD bins- Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero.
0.99 	 There's been a spate of recent surfing movies that I seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning.
0.99 	 After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy.
0.7 	 As it is now, it gets a four.
1.0 	 ...And that's being nice!
0.96 	 <br /><br />If you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways.
0.86 	 I first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick "Snuff".
0.99 	 Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes.
0.98 	 Or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about.
0.92 	 The worst is the eye scene.
0.88 	 I didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought "Damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie".
0.96 	 It's like the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino.
0.78 	 Here in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is akin to these other two films--Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean a crazy professor's chimney.
0.98 	 It seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger.
0.97 	 Late in the film, you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg!
1.0 	 While this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough.
0.61 	 Remember all the "What happened to Woody Allen?"
0.6 	 jokes?
0.87 	 Scarlett, while risking overexposure, must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light.
0.84 	 In "Scoop", she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and, in many scenes, delivers the real punchline to Mr. Allen's straight man.
0.86 	 As with most of Allen's films, the star is the script, not the actors.
0.99 	 If you are not a huge Woody the actor fan, fear not.
0.99 	 I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better, but that is not a huge tripping point.
0.99 	 Not a bad thing to be at all.
1.0 	 Undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin' 80's, which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub-genre like "Hard Rock Zombies," "Blood Tracks," "Terror on Tour," and the especially ungodly Jon-Mikl Thor-starring stinker "Rock'n'Roll Nightmare" tended to be.
0.81 	 That aside, this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f/x razzle-dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80's teen-targeted scarefest.
0.64 	 Moreover, the film's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self-righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil's music are very clever and on the money funny (famed Greed Decade heavy metal god Ozzy Osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti-metal TV evangelist!
1.0 	 Sammi encourages Eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor Eddie's life the proverbial living hell, only to have meek Eddie prove to be a most reluctant would-be accomplice.
0.6 	 It's up to Eddie, assisted by token nice girl Leslie Graham (likeably essayed by the lovely Lisa Orgolini), to stop Sammi before things get too out of hand.<br /><br />Ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith (who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher), smartly written by Michael S. Murphy, Joel Soisson, and Rhet Topham, and capably acted by a uniformly up-to-snuff cast, this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty "jump" moments (an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long-tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight), a rousing "Carrie"-style high school dance slaughter sequence, a neatly utilized Halloween setting, revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business, and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over-hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti-establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status.
1.0 	 It is simple, and simply exceptional !<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; in no way that would means the script , the quality of picture, the music score have a kind of amateurish way, no, no !
0.78 	 At least for this movie !<br /><br />***A film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles***
0.86 	 However they come back with faces of marble.
0.88 	 I had to struggle to stay awake!
0.97 	 Hopeless.<br /><br />There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance.
0.7 	 And there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through walls.
0.99 	 There's also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history.
0.99 	 Still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this.
0.55 	 I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site.
0.88 	 However, you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes.
0.74 	 If you don't have the staying power, get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights.<br /><br />Now to the film, what I say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't mind, here goes: <br /><br />Alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo.
0.92 	 Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her.
0.96 	 At this point, Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else.
0.82 	 Finally at the end, it's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him.
0.97 	 She was a whore and then she became the mother.
0.85 	 Hence, the mother and whore is the same person?
0.89 	 Anyway, what do I know!
0.99 	 French films are mostly (not all) very chatty, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes.
0.93 	 Lebrun and LÃ©aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Not a bad effort.
0.93 	 This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me.
0.67 	 Bane, Get it!
0.76 	 Like Rebane!
1.0 	 First of all I need to say that I'm Portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching Portuguese movies, probably one each year or even none...<br /><br />...And the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese people that the national pictures are awful, really close to the worst ever made!
0.99 	 (possible spoilers)<br /><br />Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
0.73 	 He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T).
0.64 	 When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights.
1.0 	 Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character.
0.64 	 Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result.
0.97 	 The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart.
0.82 	 Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger<br /><br />(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked).
0.77 	 This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).<br /><br />The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas.
0.7 	 This is offensively<br /><br />hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising<br /><br />campaign.<br /><br />The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original.
0.96 	 Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!
0.99 	 I don't know why it didn't make more of a splash than it did.
0.96 	 I would say it rates at least an 8, perhaps higher.
0.97 	 I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all.
0.64 	 The dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving.
0.54 	 Rocky
0.96 	 This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats.
0.95 	 The best part is probably the end.
0.98 	 It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good.
0.92 	 If you don't like the show, don't see the movie.
0.92 	 It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny.
0.55 	 There are even a few "heart-wrenching" scenes toward the end.
0.55 	 We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV, too.
0.99 	 If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up.
0.93 	 The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better.
0.84 	 <br /><br />---SPOILERS---<br /><br />Dr.
0.55 	 Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible.
0.89 	 After animal testings, they move on to human testing.
0.81 	 Volenteering, Caine is turned invisible.
0.84 	 Becoming the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go.
0.97 	 The first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work.
0.94 	 Then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man.
0.93 	 And then change the water into fire and explosions.
1.0 	 A rehashing of a killer shark movie.
0.98 	 The robots are sad and the main "hero" 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch.
0.98 	 It's sad when you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for.
0.91 	 The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear).
1.0 	 he did a great job with Speed and Twister.
1.0 	 Too many characters came and left, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad and then they decided to do Sabrina at college which ruined it for me.<br /><br />Sabrina became self-absorbed at college, there was less magic, no spell book, no aunts living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying.<br /><br />The last series was boring, and i only watched to see what happened in the end.
0.98 	 Not having Hilda and Zelda seemed wrong somehow and Miles was gone just like that.
1.0 	 The title song is great, though.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.99 	 And I love the daily show and Colbert report.
1.0 	 They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV.
0.99 	 I see where it can be funny and it is(hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious.).
0.91 	 I really cannot see this show going past 1 season.
0.58 	 I didn't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie, and I LOVED Dark Shadows.
0.94 	 So, at the end, the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?)
0.5 	 to the wedding place, which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind?
0.51 	 Everyone is laughing and rejoicing, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams or something, and that's the end.
0.81 	 They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind.
0.85 	 Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended.
1.0 	 Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again.
0.99 	 You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film.
0.98 	 And in this remaining time, its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers.
0.98 	 Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together.
0.94 	 Then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman, and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film.
0.77 	 Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery.
0.76 	 <br /><br />There are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to.
0.52 	 The only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography.
1.0 	 The land is shot beautifully, oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive.
0.54 	 <br /><br />One last thing.
0.96 	 Oh and please Ms. Rainer that was a really nice one note performance, not, if i could i rip the Oscar out of your hands, oh i would.
0.98 	 If you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get The Grapes of Wrath, a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets.
0.99 	 Skullduggery is a strange, strange film based on the novel "Ye Shall Know Them" by Vercors.
0.82 	 To unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind, since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity, and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance.
0.99 	 But in spite of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone, Skullduggery simply isn't a very good film.
1.0 	 The differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great, too jarring, to overlook.
0.52 	 One of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist Dr Sybil Greame (Susan Clark).
0.99 	 These primitive, long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man.
0.97 	 Or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics?
0.96 	 The archaeologists call the tribe "the Tropi" and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery.
0.78 	 But things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen (Paul Hubschmid) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers.
0.96 	 He questions whether the Tropi are truly "human" and takes his argument to the courts, where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued.<br /><br />This was a very early film in Reynolds' career, and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously.
0.9 	 Not that Reynolds can be blamed Â he has an impossible role, asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick.
0.88 	 His character and the film are not relevant to each other.
0.99 	 Clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there are nice supporting roles for British actors Edward Fox, Alexander Knox and Wilfrid Hyde-White.
0.53 	 The honourable intentions are there for all to see, but the end result doesn't do them justice.
0.93 	 The emotion she must have gone through shooting re-take after re-take doesn't bare thinking about.
0.84 	 This was a very hard movie to watch, the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity.
0.99 	 I actually felt that the whole thing deflated somewhat when her friends returned to the house and I didn't find the conclusion at all plausible.
0.86 	 The special effects are actually quite good, and the gore is well done.
0.69 	 The history part was fine but the musical part was not.
0.57 	 It so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was Michael Meyers, whom I eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep.
0.86 	 This all could happen.
0.67 	 On his way he kills and kills.
0.96 	 The child's name is Michael Meyers, though he is not a person.
0.66 	 John Carpenter uses Michael Meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia.
0.98 	 He is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath.
1.0 	 The generic overalls, bleached-white Shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete Michael's generification.
0.95 	 He is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos.
0.99 	 It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
0.6 	 Kalifornia is disturbing.
0.92 	 It is neither entertaining nor does it have social value.
1.0 	 Technically, the movie is very well make, the performances are top rate and first class.
1.0 	 The story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest.
0.94 	 I thought it must have been made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990.
0.65 	 OK, lots of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think 'what's the point?'.
0.96 	 it looks totally unbelievable.
0.99 	 On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular "A-Team" episode.
0.76 	 You can count me out of this one, Mr. Cameron!
0.99 	 A good deal of running around.
1.0 	 Along with his pretty wife, he invades their territory and is given secrets about them.
0.99 	 There is a scene where he gives them everything they want.
1.0 	 Easily the best known of all the Shakespeare plays, it has been seriously let down here.
0.91 	 Shoddy direction, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.<br /><br />In the town of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet.
0.99 	 It's a story that, with it's energy, deserves to be shot outdoors.
0.98 	 It is very hard for the audience to relate to this Romeo.
0.83 	 Rebecca Saire is too youthful to be a good Juliet - she captures the character's naivetÃ© but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.<br /><br />The supporting roles don't fare much better.
1.0 	 Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut.
0.68 	 Alan Rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as Tybalt.
0.88 	 He did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years, but that isn't in evidence here.
1.0 	 Only Micheal Hordern, in probably his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity.
1.0 	 His Capulet is well-played and a joy to watch.<br /><br />See one of the other versions of this story instead.
0.65 	 As a big-time Prince fan of the last three to four years, I really can't believe I've only just got round to watching "Purple Rain".
0.84 	 Wow, I was really looking forward to watching it, but I wasn't prepared for just how electric it actually is.
0.81 	 ), it blew me away.
0.99 	 Most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line, watch it for the mindless action.
0.94 	 And mindless action is right.
0.6 	 You get to see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets.
0.95 	 That is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped.
0.99 	 He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive.
0.89 	 We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq.
0.7 	 However, this is not Stones first oddball departure.
0.94 	 With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended.<br /><br />The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour film or a TV mini-series.
1.0 	 MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt about it.<br /><br />Yet I could write a whole thesis on the Truman-MacArthur relations.
0.77 	 Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis.
0.8 	 The proposition of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a Hooverville.<br /><br />Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much.
0.99 	 And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal.
0.63 	 Spence takes Loretta Young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle.
0.94 	 And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage.
0.53 	 Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously.<br /><br />Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, Marjorie Rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl, a really loathsome creep who has his eye on Young as well.
0.76 	 I started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it.
0.51 	 in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show, you should because you will get hooked on it.
1.0 	 nothing terrible happens, like violence or swearing.
0.89 	 and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid, well that's too bad for you because you won't get as far in life even if you are happy with your life.
0.99 	 The adaptation isn't without its problems, there were times when the humour, and there were valiant attempts to get it right, was a little overdone, and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed.
0.98 	 I also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded.
0.59 	 I agree that Capital City should be on DVD.
0.87 	 I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes.
0.54 	 The show is less than an hour long.
0.94 	 I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season.
0.97 	 I felt this show should have lasted longer.
0.79 	 Riddled with spine-chilling moments, this is an episode no "Who" fan can afford to miss.<br /><br />Starting from when the pit was opened after the events in "The Impossible Planet", the Doctor and Ida are trapped and are running out of air.
0.88 	 The movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start - I think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial.
0.69 	 After this he heads to Mrs Drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide.
0.97 	 But only in doses does it draw upon tag.
0.73 	 Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black.
0.93 	 Who mostly appears as a background figure, it's ultimately creepy.
0.94 	 She might not appear all that much, but when she does
.
0.64 	 That also goes for that downbeat conclusion.
0.95 	 A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you.
0.88 	 Instead of going out to shock us, some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won't let go.
0.79 	 It might not share much new to the sub-genre, but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse.
0.99 	 I've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand, but I certainly disagree.
0.74 	 All Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human.
0.6 	 The main character says something like "by this trial, we have to make aggressive war a crime".
0.95 	 Is America a peaceful nation with its world #1 $420 billion "defense" budget (#2 China with just $51b)?
0.98 	 Why portray America as a peaceful nation when it isn't?
0.77 	 This is one of them.
0.99 	 Little do they know, a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword.
0.95 	 To be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.
0.93 	 The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc.
0.83 	 Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot.
0.51 	 4/10.
0.8 	 As the 2000's came to a close, king Kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end.<br /><br />While Miss Winfrey was tearing up, i was laughing and screaming like a wild Indian from the old west.<br /><br />So what does Oprah do?
1.0 	 she takes famous people, and puts them on her show.
0.99 	 what kind of famous people?
0.98 	 but that one particular show told about Michael's personal life, something not many people knew about at the time.<br /><br />Oprah's Real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms.
0.72 	 They seem to think she's like a personal Jesus sometimes.
0.81 	 but all i see in Oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big, and she's just showing off how rich she is.<br /><br />I'm glad her shows going to end soon.
0.89 	 we need better television programs.
0.87 	 I can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge.<br /><br />First of all, those girls are not Geisha, but brothel tenants, and one that don't know the difference will not understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end.
0.99 	 Terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking.
0.95 	 Plot goes as follows.
0.77 	 Kill the safari people.
0.69 	 Tarzan looking guy has a fight scene.
0.88 	 Saves Bo.
0.55 	 Run credits.
0.78 	 Run credits, run.
0.77 	 Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout.
0.86 	 2) Winona Ryder.
0.65 	 I'd rather watch BOBBY DEERFIELD than this.<br /><br />Lastly, read the play and learn it for yourself.
0.8 	 Go out and see it performed.
0.9 	 My God!
0.85 	 Plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, slapstick humor is great when it's smartly done as in the other films I mentioned, but this movie simply misses the mark.
0.99 	 This one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era.
1.0 	 Of course, that doesn't mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold.
0.56 	 It's the same feeling you may get after watching this.
0.5 	 While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits.
0.94 	 What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this?
0.71 	 Every copy of "Mad Dog Time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire.
0.95 	 Underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro.
1.0 	 The scenes of Old Edo -- with the courtesan, drifting on the Sumida, rehearsing and acting in the Nakamura-za -- were all exciting and engaging, taking you back to an interesting and rich era.
0.99 	 The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed.
0.84 	 The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance.
0.88 	 Pow!
0.77 	 Crush!
0.88 	 Boom!
0.89 	 Holy Toledo Batman!
0.58 	 How can anybody say that this movie is a comedy??
0.95 	 I said yes only to spare her feelings.
0.88 	 *Warning - no plot spoilers ahead, but movie spoilers nonetheless...* My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast.
0.97 	 It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes).
0.51 	 0.5/10.
0.56 	 The acting is among the worst I have ever seen, what is really amazing is that EVERYONE is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone.
0.97 	 It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards.
0.64 	 Cheesy.
0.8 	 Benoit and Guerrero heated up early on by taking turns hammering first Spike and then Bubba Ray.
0.56 	 Spike tried to help his brother, but the referee restrained him while Benoit and Guerrero ganged up on him in the corner.
0.68 	 Spike dashed into the ring and somersaulted over the top rope onto Guerrero on the outside!
0.9 	 The tandem then set up for a double superplex from the middle rope which would have put Bubba through the table, but Spike knocked the table over right before his brother came crashing down!
0.89 	 Bubba caught fire and lifted both opponents into back body drops!
0.99 	 Bubba slammed Guerrero and Spike stomped on the Wolverine from off the top rope.
0.87 	 headbutt!
0.74 	 Bubba came to his brother's rescue and managed to sprawl Benoit on a table.
0.74 	 But because his opponents didn't force him through the table, Bubba was allowed to stay in the match.
0.96 	 Kidman tossed Nidia aside but was taken down with a modified arm bar.
0.69 	 Noble continued to attack Kidman's injured arm back in the ring.
0.75 	 Kidman's injured harm hampered his offense, but he continued to battle hard.
0.61 	 Noble tried to put Kidman away with a powerbomb but the challenger countered into a facebuster.
0.72 	 Kidman went to finish things with a Shooting Star Press, but Noble broke up the attempt.
0.9 	 Kidman went for the Shooting Star Press again, but this time Noble just rolled out of harm's way.
0.71 	 Back in the ring, Jeff hit the Whisper in the wind to knock Regal for a loop.
0.51 	 Jeff went for the Swanton Bomb, but Regal got his knees up to hit Jeff with a devastating shot.
0.76 	 Jericho continued to knock Cena around the ring until his cockiness got the better of him.
0.91 	 While on the top rope, Jericho began to showboat and allowed Cena to grab him for a superplex!
0.96 	 Cena followed with a tilt-a-whirl slam but was taken down with a nasty dropkick to the gut.
0.99 	 The rookie recovered and hit a belly to belly suplex but couldn't put Y2J away.
0.84 	 Jericho launched into the Lionsault but Cena dodged the move.
0.86 	 Jericho nailed a bulldog and then connected on the Lionsault, but did not go for the cover.
0.99 	 Cena had other ideas, reversing the move into a pin attempt and getting the 1-2-3!
0.96 	 Jericho went berserk after the match.
0.8 	 The big man rolled out of the ring and kicked the steel steps out of frustration.
0.95 	 RVD landed painfully on his back, then had to suffer from having his spine cracked against the steel ring steps.
0.57 	 RVD broke away and soon after leveled Brock with a kick to the temple.
0.99 	 He went for the pin, but Heyman pulled the ref from the ring!
0.87 	 The ref immediately called for a disqualification and soon traded blows with Heyman!
0.51 	 After, RVD leapt onto Brock from the top rope and then threatened to hit the Van Terminator!
0.54 	 Heyman grabbed RVD's leg and Brock picked up the champ and this time connected with the F-5 onto a steel chair!
0.85 	 Booker tried to get back into the game by choking Show with a camera cable at ringside.
0.79 	 Show grabbed Booker's throat but was met by a low blow and a kick to the face.
0.95 	 Booker climbed the top rope and nailed a somersaulting leg drop to get the pin!
0.95 	 Before he could speak, Eric Bishoff stopped The Game to apologize for getting involved in his personal business.
0.59 	 She said the two of them were once unstoppable and they can be again.
0.94 	 Bischoff cut her off and begged her to stop.
0.8 	 Stephanie cited that Triple H once told her how Bischoff said Triple H had no talent and no charisma.
0.8 	 The two continued to bicker back and forth, until Triple H stepped up with his microphone.
0.56 	 The Game said it would be easy to say "screw you" to either one of them.
0.76 	 Triple H went to shake Bischoff's hand, but pulled it away.
0.95 	 He said he would rather go with the devil he knows, rather than the one he doesn't know.
0.95 	 HBK said the last thing he wanted to do was cause any trouble.
0.97 	 Bischoff said the difference between the two of them is that he's got testicles and she doesn't.
0.98 	 Hogan began to Hulk up and soon caught Christian with a big boot and a leg drop!
0.86 	 Edge tagged in soon after and dropped both opponents.
0.79 	 He speared both of them into the corner turnbuckles, but missed a spear on Strom and hit the ref hard instead.
0.99 	 Edge nailed a DDT, but the ref was down and could not count.
0.86 	 Storm tried to get the pin, but Edge kicked out after two.
0.91 	 Riksihi sprinted in to fend off Test, allowing Edge to recover and spear Storm.
0.94 	 Taker and Rock got into it back into the ring, and Taker dropped The Rock with a sidewalk slam to get a two-count.
0.95 	 Angle broke up the pin attempt that likely would have given The Rock the title.
0.56 	 The Rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to Kurt Angle.
0.58 	 Soon after, The Rock disposed of Angle and hit the People's Elbow on the Undertaker.
0.99 	 Taker landed a guillotine leg drop onto Angle, laying on the ring apron.
0.9 	 The Rock picked himself up just in time to break up a pin attempt on Kurt Angle.
0.89 	 Taker nailed Rock with a DDT and set him up for a chokeslam.
0.96 	 ANgle tried sneaking up with a steel chair, but Taker caught on to that tomfoolery and smacked it out of his hands.
1.0 	 The referee got caught in the ensuing fire and didn't see Angle knock Taker silly with a steel chair.
0.96 	 Angle went to cover Taker as The Rock lay prone, but the Dead Man somehow got his shoulder up.
0.99 	 Angle tried to pin Rock, but he too kicked out.
0.95 	 Angle looked like he was about to tap, but Taker kicked The Rock out of the submission hold.
0.99 	 He picked Angle up for the last ride, but Angle put on a triangle choke!
0.86 	 It looked like Taker was about to pass out, but The Rock broke Angle's hold only to find himself caught in the ankle lock.
0.87 	 Rock got out of the hold and watched Taker chokeslam Angle.
0.98 	 Rocky hit the Rock Bottom, but Taker refused to go down and kicked out.
0.76 	 Winner and New WWE Champion: The Rock<br /><br />~Finally there is a decent PPV!
0.84 	 I give this PPV a A-<br /><br />
0.81 	 A few years ago, I did manage to watch "Elvira's Haunted Hills" (made in 2001), but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much.
1.0 	 Was it really that forgettable, or should I give it another watch?
1.0 	 In less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her (often unintentionally) provocative behaviour.
0.99 	 To make things worse, her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected: A rundown mansion, a cookbook and a poodle.
0.99 	 Simple, of course, but coherent.
0.9 	 While other movies, heavily relying on gag-like situations, often make you loose track of the story completely (like the "Naked Gun" films, for example), this film doesn't.
0.99 	 Let alone a horror-spoof that doesn't derail at some point ("Killer Party", although I'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale) or becomes too tedious too quickly ("Saturday the 14th").
1.0 	 Although "Elvira" is more comedy than horror, it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale, complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of Falwell between newborn witch Elvira and evil uncle wizard Talbot, including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and Elvira's very own burn-at-the-stake moment.<br /><br />I'm telling you, there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny.
0.95 	 One of the first giggles I got was during the opening credits already, when Daniel Greene's name appeared.
0.6 	 Oh yes, I recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face).
0.98 	 But if you haven't seen "Atomic Cyborg", then I'm sorry, but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one.
0.76 	 And on a side-note: I never could have imagined Elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station.
0.98 	 Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.
0.74 	 What tripe.<br /><br />As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater.
0.86 	 Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.
0.95 	 The usual cat and mouse antics abound until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink.
0.63 	 He gets the bright idea of torturing Tom without him knowing.
0.99 	 The cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him 'see' jerry even if it's not fool-proof.
0.97 	 Most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be.
1.0 	 Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high.
0.81 	 I personally recommend you avoid this like the plague, though several friends of mine enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).Âº
0.99 	 Critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit.
0.88 	 It was nominated but didn't win.
0.93 	 Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good.
0.96 	 Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it.
0.99 	 Two birds with one stone, you know.<br /><br />The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clichÃ©s or even ending up with caricatures of either type.
1.0 	 Incidentally, I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right.
0.74 	 There is not much else to say about the film, but Muppet fans should see it for sure.
0.91 	 I don't think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not.<br /><br />So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street.
0.86 	 It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on "Deliverance" didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and "squeal like a pig" wasn't a part of "Deulling Banjos".<br /><br />I hate the term "hillbillies", because - as some "users" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life.
0.94 	 Much is made of "inbred" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods.
1.0 	 However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude.
0.58 	 Their "justice" can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the "justice" in city streets.
0.99 	 They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.<br /><br />"Deliverance" was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I'm wrong.
0.87 	 He was extremely underpaid for "Midnight Cowboy", because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat.
0.59 	 Wow!
0.97 	 One must ask what led him into those other tacky films?
0.96 	 His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life.
0.79 	 As noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie.
0.95 	 Several "users" have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide.
0.96 	 He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel.
0.52 	 Justice ?
0.68 	 - "don't come back up here again".
0.97 	 Not many "users" knew "hillbillies" were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better?
0.93 	 Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods?
0.86 	 A bit later, there's Ray again, molesting Pia, not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose.
0.9 	 There's the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!"
1.0 	 There's that garden hose again, as Walter waves it Pia's face and roars "Is this more to your liking!?"
0.9 	 Perhaps best of all, there's Pia's typewriter, but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most (afterwards, I was afraid to open my laptop).
0.54 	 Be forewarned, though, that once you start watching you probably won't be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever.
0.99 	 I'm sure there are many challenges facing a first-time Director.
0.5 	 Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose is fairly typical example.
0.5 	 It paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!
0.95 	 ), but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination were widespread, for instance).
0.57 	 And at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ).<br /><br />Overall, thought, I suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing, and it's certainly wholesome...
0.83 	 Very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.
0.89 	 After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman, a trail boss winds up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states.
0.9 	 I do have some complaints though.
0.86 	 In the first part, the Tank Bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all.
0.71 	 One might also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was cool.
0.75 	 Buaku rules.
0.99 	 As a long-standing Barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased.
0.54 	 I don't think she was ever satisfied.
0.97 	 But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it.
0.88 	 Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system.
1.0 	 I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s.
0.96 	 Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick.
1.0 	 I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy" I loved his acting in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams.. whoa!
0.87 	 There are several things wrong with this movie- Brenda Song's character being one of them.
0.99 	 Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural.
0.79 	 I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight "the great evil" and save the world?
0.85 	 Which brings me to another point.
0.64 	 I know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in Chinese culture.
0.75 	 It seems like all of the "warriors" in Wendy's family line were women.
0.91 	 Yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming- I mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming?
0.72 	 She is extremely careless- even for someone like her.
0.87 	 I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone."
0.77 	 Let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training.
1.0 	 Shen also told Wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (I am assuming that part).<br /><br />This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable.<br /><br />As the script-writer would have it, Wendy's homecoming and this "great battle" are on exactly the same day.
0.9 	 Yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, (who Shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she "felt weird fighting an old man") inform her that Shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.<br /><br />We initially see some half-decent fighting, that is actually entertaining.
0.56 	 Until finally, the great evil comes out of Wendy's rival-for-homecoming's body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.<br /><br />Don't ask.<br /><br />Anyway, Wendy gets all "panicky."
0.78 	 Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.<br /><br />Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.<br /><br />She screams title of said article out.<br /><br />Now...it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful far, far too fast.
0.72 	 No, I will not let it be excused because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power within" her.<br /><br />Since when, though, did she learn healing?
0.95 	 So Shen is raised from the dead.
0.73 	 Then, Wendy and he fight the guy.<br /><br />He loses way to easily.
0.68 	 This movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.<br /><br />So, I suppose it was all right.
1.0 	 We learn that Ungar is not only a member of this "poker club" but the group knows what's happening to him and try, in their inept way, to help out.
0.89 	 Madison is a carefree happy-go-lucky if rather irresponsible slob who's refrigerator was last cleaned probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House.
1.0 	 Madison's idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread, and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table.
0.78 	 <br /><br />Ungar is not only altogether different, he is diametrically opposite.
0.93 	 At another moment, Ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw.
1.0 	 When Madison seems unimpressed, Ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can't stand coleslaw.
0.54 	 He seems to have every health condition in the book.
0.84 	 And if they made up more, Felix would probably have them.
0.52 	 Ultimately, he is overly self-absorbed.<br /><br />Running throughout the movie are references to marriage.
0.85 	 At one point when Madison is trying to convince Ungar to move in, he says, "What do you want, a wedding ring?"
0.74 	 But little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can't deal with the messy guy, but the other way around.
0.98 	 It is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today.
0.66 	 I dislike this movie a lot.
0.98 	 The characters and the relationships among them are distorted.
0.89 	 He damaged all his previous work.
1.0 	 The Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90's story about the mob, and it is great.
0.77 	 After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike.
1.0 	 But "the last great American Western", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once?
0.6 	 Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously.
0.73 	 It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns.
0.89 	 The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.<br /><br />Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great.
1.0 	 However, if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead.<br /><br />3 out of 10
0.57 	 Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps.
0.97 	 In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment.
0.97 	 Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this.
0.68 	 Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
1.0 	 The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in Hollywood.
0.99 	 Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase.
0.99 	 Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River.
0.95 	 Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene, with fairly glaring lapses.
0.99 	 Yet so does Red River, which is still the single greatest western ever made.
0.78 	 So perfection isn't everything.
0.84 	 Mann's camera is a one man course in cinematography.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The Far Country has one amazing moment.
0.7 	 And as usual it comes from Stewart.
0.87 	 Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man.
1.0 	 He is absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester, and Man from Laramie: in Bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from Dachau, in Far he is shot off a raft with such violence, it looks so convincing that you wince, and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man, well you find yourself looking for the burn marks.
0.97 	 <br /><br />But that was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West.
1.0 	 <br /><br />What a great, great director.
0.74 	 <br /><br />See every western he ever made.
0.92 	 They are his real monuments, even if all are scetchy.
1.0 	 When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody, including Ford.
1.0 	 And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone, period.<br /><br />Thanks, Anthony.
0.79 	 I realize that's all too common for no-budget movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, kind-a of) which left me wondering why did the director (or screenwriter, whatever) chose to focus on how the epidemic started - it's a short, nobody's gonna care anyway.
0.58 	 Have the rental houses run out of tripods and Steadicams?
1.0 	 <br /><br />- The oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within.
0.93 	 The zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents.
0.87 	 <br /><br />- Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc.
0.73 	 on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there.
0.99 	 Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin.
0.96 	 It may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly, it's pretty cheesy, but it's just so much fun!
0.98 	 Admit it, though foolish, they make you grin and turn your tickle box over.
0.99 	 This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities, it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add, the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win), that is how far short this film falls.
0.57 	 If you asked me to name a good gangster movie, I'd have dozens to choose from.
0.98 	 The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult.
0.99 	 Meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named Kenny (Jon Voight) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict (or kill) him.<br /><br />Perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous "Goodfellas" (1990) and the first two "Godfather" films, I was expecting too much from "The General."
0.93 	 Let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented.
0.79 	 For some reason, director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film.
1.0 	 "Schindler's List" (1993) was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it's a masterpiece.
0.65 	 Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did.
0.98 	 Maybe some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" is too clearly delivered, but to me this didn't destroy the film in any way.
0.83 	 Why?
0.66 	 Because it's hooooottttttttttt.
0.99 	 And because everyone looks better wet (at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy).
0.83 	 <br /><br />Anyway - there might be some spoilers in here.
0.72 	 or quickly paced adventures (again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette).
1.0 	 If anything, the simply 'okay' plot has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else.
0.53 	 With Thompson, plots are almost secondary; he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger, more confusing characters.
0.83 	 So, really, the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and, if you don't like it, well the jokes on you.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead.
0.96 	 She simply doesn't have the chops (or the looks for that matter) and though she and Patric have some chemistry, I don't have it with her.
0.61 	 So there.
0.81 	 Although I use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what I think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films, after watching this "movie" on Film Four last night I felt compelled to write something down, even if it just helps cleanse me once again.<br /><br />The film was possibly the shallowest experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23?
0.78 	 You sure?)
0.8 	 This is one of the others....
0.67 	 So, every year there is at least one movie, that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybody's picking on this movie...
0.7 	 Not every movie is supposed to be a new The Lord of the Rings!
1.0 	 I can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here.
0.97 	 Maybe the story isn't Oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be!
0.77 	 So give it a try!
0.97 	 He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded.
0.92 	 Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: B+
0.98 	 After watching Revolt Of The Zombies starring future Academy Award winner Dean Jagger I was left with one burning question.
1.0 	 How was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place?
0.94 	 <br /><br />That's the question you'll be pondering if you take time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies.
1.0 	 Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he's determined to woo Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Noland.<br /><br />I think you've got some idea how this comes out, especially since a race of zombies didn't conquer the world for one country.
0.93 	 I have seen it several times and never get bored with it.
0.56 	 Don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut (like me...) This could be happening on earth, the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting.
0.93 	 there are no space ships or laser guns (None yet anyway) So far I've seen up to s01 e04 and I'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities.<br /><br />The cast play there roles with pasion.
1.0 	 I thought finally Australia had made a good film.. but I was wrong.<br /><br />This was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever.
0.97 	 I feel sorry for Molly Ringwald having to come all the way to Australia to make an awful movie.<br /><br />The acting was terrible (especially that Australian guy who was trying to speak in an American accent), and the plot was also pretty bad.<br /><br />When I first heard about this film coming out, I thought that the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheesy film "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie.<br /><br />WARNING!!!
0.99 	 !<br /><br />Probably the worst thing about the film was the ending.
0.97 	 I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was.. but the killer wasn't even human.. which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie.<br /><br />Don't see this film.. you'll probably be disappointed!
0.55 	 This is because the American conglomerate, Tamerlane, that is putting the country "back together" will not stand for Shariff, an oil man from a neighboring state, laying down his own pipeline through war-torn Turquistan.
0.56 	 But, once there, Brand runs into difficulties.
0.99 	 With other inept underlings and complications, will Brand be able to carry out his mission, for the satisfaction of Tamerlane's BIG boss, the former vice-president (Dan Ackroyd)?
0.91 	 The recreation of war-riddled Baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch.
0.92 	 Brand produces the cash but, because he has no candy, the boy burns his vehicle anyway.
0.95 	 Then, also, the direction is not a total success but doesn't lag very often.
0.92 	 No, if you have conservative leanings, you probably won't like this film one bit.
0.51 	 1/10
0.84 	 I had never seen a film like this before.
0.77 	 Way back when I was renting videos for free I picked this one up.
0.86 	 Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains.
0.79 	 Once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?)
0.98 	 The backdrop (Pyrenees?)
1.0 	 makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences.
0.95 	 The verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them.
1.0 	 The photography is nice.
0.65 	 You can view this film at archive.org.
0.51 	 It may be a clichÃ©, but he was a people's writer.<br /><br />And it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations.
0.76 	 All of the misery and cruelty is their, but non of the humour, irony, and savage lampoonery.
0.98 	 The result is just a dark, dismal experience: the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist.
0.62 	 It's not really Dickens at all.<br /><br />'Oliver!
0.99 	 The mockery of officialdom is perfectly interpreted, from the blustering beadle to the drunken magistrate.
0.99 	 The classic stand-off between the beadle and Mr Brownlow, in which the law is described as 'a ass, a idiot' couldn't have been better done.
0.61 	 In the novel, he was utterly ruthless, sending some of his own boys to the gallows in order to protect himself (though he was also caught and hanged).
0.62 	 Whereas in the movie, he is presented as something of a wayward father-figure, a sort of charitable thief rather than a corrupter of children, the latter being a long-standing anti-semitic sentiment.
0.76 	 It's schmaltzy, but it's Dickens through and through.<br /><br />I could go on.
0.64 	 No original has been better realised.
0.96 	 **May Contain Spoilers**<br /><br />A dude in a dopey-looking Kong suit (the same one used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) provides much of the laffs in this much-mocked monster flick.
0.87 	 Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around.
0.79 	 Like many of Honda's flicks this may have had some merit before American audiences diddled around with it and added new footage.
0.82 	 You know, just like a comedy is supposed to be.
0.52 	 So, what more do you want?
0.54 	 She is so much better here than in anything else I've ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good.
0.86 	 Like a silent movie star, but better.
1.0 	 I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend.
0.69 	 The Eyes Have It!
0.57 	 Yeah, he's damn good.
0.99 	 OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I hear ya.<br /><br />And then, there's the Hair.
0.99 	 They get bigger and sillier, just like your's did.
1.0 	 I'm sick of Movies that tell me I'm supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie.
0.9 	 TV Soap Actors.
0.96 	 Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg's Minority Report or Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly.
0.65 	 This film had such promise!!
0.99 	 In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape.
0.92 	 By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.<br /><br />This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic.
0.99 	 In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons.
0.99 	 In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile.
0.54 	 Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter.
1.0 	 I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.<br /><br />The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.<br /><br />As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I won't lie and I'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece.
0.98 	 For what it's worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.
1.0 	 The most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy is walking... and walking... and walking (spoiler).
0.59 	 Not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day.
0.95 	 How can such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet could have been involved in such a... a... well, such a thing ?
0.59 	 Wow.
0.97 	 Every character felt so real (although most of them petty, selfish a**holes) and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter's feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing.
0.98 	 I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and of the few reviews that there are to be positive.
1.0 	 I didn't find it very enjoyable at all.
0.99 	 I'm never much for classic films.
0.91 	 Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and Citizen Kane bore me.
0.99 	 However, I would much rather watch any one of those films 3,469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch An American in Paris once in the most luxurious suite ever.
0.64 	 If I did the latter, I'd probably be sleeping the entire time.<br /><br />The color art direction and the music didn't interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin.
1.0 	 Maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun Â Check!
0.99 	 Isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen Â Check!
1.0 	 Tasty looking love interest Â Check!
0.94 	 Corny one liners Â Check!<br /><br />Deary me, does this film take the wee wee or what?
0.62 	 It looks like the first sequel is a rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, well goodness knows!
0.51 	 !
0.97 	 Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best she could with the material but it's threadbare.
0.99 	 As for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it.
0.74 	 Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history.
0.88 	 Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux.
0.83 	 Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less!
0.91 	 Sometimes it's somewhat suspenseful, but never a good shocker.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD<br /><br />The fun lies in ridiculous moments.
1.0 	 But the all-time classic moment is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer.
0.91 	 To spare costs, all license plates are USA, and the background in the news studio is a skyline of Manhattan.
0.93 	 Very funny if you're Dutch and watching the original version in Dutch.
0.96 	 (I have trouble liking any of the Baldwins, due to Alec's extra-curricular, political activities, but William was not too bad in this movie.
0.84 	 I suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set.
0.75 	 I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It is too bad that Lydia Reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear.
0.95 	 However one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee.
0.69 	 As per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination.
0.63 	 After watching it, however, I honestly believe that I could have made a better documentary myself.
0.71 	 me).
1.0 	 Another comment about this film made it sound lousy.
0.89 	 Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good.
0.58 	 This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion.
0.71 	 This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.<br /><br />Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it.
0.99 	 Robert DeNiro is hysterical.
0.84 	 But let's face it, the lines aren't really important.
1.0 	 Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director.
1.0 	 He had done a remake/reworking of Godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded tremendously.
0.98 	 Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd.<br /><br />Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most.
0.5 	 Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film.
0.97 	 The championship game is only a couple of days away, but things in New Orleans aren't as they should be.
1.0 	 From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable, wonderful time.
0.6 	 The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he's there.
0.63 	 Donna Mills as a hit"man"?
0.94 	 The lone highlight for me was the voice-over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to.
0.99 	 The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.<br /><br />Like most others who have seen Superdome, I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000.
1.0 	 It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the shows early start.
0.99 	 So even though I've only rated Superdome a 2/10, I'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
0.97 	 I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970.
0.73 	 John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he licks and leers at the screen, he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there.
0.68 	 Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene.
1.0 	 Bravo for debut performances!
0.97 	 But , of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west.
0.93 	 To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this, and I was glad I at least saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the beginning.
0.92 	 Ellman feels this will enable her to "change the direction of the human brain", naturally enabling her to rule the world, provided she can get us all attached to those wires with no trouble.<br /><br />Elmann is also into werewolves, because she kidnaps Daninsky and takes him to her hidden laboratory.
0.83 	 She has a bunch of other people trapped there as well.
0.6 	 Some of them look like gypsies, and are chained up, being in varying states of lucidity.
0.67 	 Elmann feels that one day she may be able to "help them be human again" (?
0.96 	 ), but in the meantime she controls them with her chematodes.
0.8 	 Good.
0.94 	 That's the film's saving grace.
0.98 	 "Fury of the Wolfman" may be the best Halloween party movie ever.
0.99 	 I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare.
0.99 	 The trail leads the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep.<br /><br />This is one of the countless soft-core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill.Personally I'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we're seeing.
0.6 	 This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not.
0.94 	 Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead.Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of S&M to the proceedings.
0.99 	 I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure.
0.99 	 when my wife came to Sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh.
0.81 	 but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again.
0.82 	 if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh.
0.68 	 WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi.. Oh yes.. when read the "spoilers" explanation, "'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film."
0.96 	 And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see, even if it showed her watching paint dry.<br /><br />Being curious, I checked this site's production info.
0.69 	 One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, say, the typical "Lifetime" flick.
0.91 	 The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics.
0.86 	 In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe, a Countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt; she's aided by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life.
0.98 	 Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant.
0.6 	 The results are good-looking, but unabsorbing.
0.86 	 It all falls apart after that, it's your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore, minus any kind of humour, wit or soul.
0.81 	 Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead, also starring Leonard Nimoy.
0.91 	 Gordon Parks, the prolific black Life magazine photographer, made a true ticking-timebomb of a movie here - one that does not mess around!
0.87 	 Based upon the true story of two NYC cops - later dubbed Batman and Robin - who singlehandedly employed radical tactics to clean up their precinct neighborhood of drugs, this is a cop-buddy movie before that term became a repetitive formula.
1.0 	 Lightning paced, there is not one unimportant throwaway scene here.<br /><br />Man, early '70s NYC must have been a terrible place to be a police officer, from the looks of movies like this and "Serpico."
0.77 	 The only thing that does not just suck (harder than a Vampire) is Jason Scott Lee.... his character is at least a little bit cool, has some mystery, and kicks a little butt.
0.7 	 Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano, the thinking man's gangster, with the reality of the life he has been born to and, quite frankly, would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up.
0.52 	 If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends.
0.87 	 If you didn't, trust me you've never seen a TV show end like this.
0.79 	 The majority of the jokes were based around "Geranium's" physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet's.
1.0 	 I will never forget the wit and great comedy of the ORIGINAL Vacation movie!
0.99 	 The lines, pacing, and timing of events in that film are outstanding!
0.99 	 However, this European Vacation sequel is a major let down.<br /><br />In this sequel, the Griswalds win a European Vacation on a game show.
0.54 	 The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, "ha-ha" laughs.
0.97 	 That's really about the only line that is funny in this film.<br /><br />European Vacation's humor is strained.
0.99 	 The place that made them legends!
0.99 	 Viewers should re-watch the original Vacation movie in place of this!
0.65 	 You'll be glad you did.
1.0 	 If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will need to look elsewhere.
0.84 	 or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (e.g., mass murder, the destruction of Israel), this is the documentary for you.
1.0 	 Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US.
0.98 	 Extremely predictable, far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way.
0.65 	 This could have been a good episode but I simply had to turn it off.
0.94 	 Also with the 2 English boys... well I don't think any English boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry's preteen public appearances.
0.94 	 To American film makers..
0.86 	 There is more than 1 country in the UK.
0.94 	 England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.. meaning more than 1 culture!
0.57 	 Fire looked cool though!
0.72 	 As a lover of bad movies, I definitely hit paydirt with this one.
0.99 	 The plot isn't really that bad, but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself "what the heck is going on here?
0.98 	 First off, Rudy Ray Moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of speeding up the fight scenes to double time.
0.53 	 Though not seen in too many films prior, you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since.
0.66 	 To say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement.
0.76 	 Darius went on to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store.
0.56 	 He faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.<br /><br />But on the other hand, who cares?
0.99 	 The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />The acting isn't too subtle, either.
0.56 	 Indeed, I'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'Police Story' at all.
0.61 	 I mean, when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new "Wow!"
1.0 	 Michele Morgan is an annoying, inane presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me.
0.51 	 Leon Erroll is silly, as always, but overall pretty funny.
0.9 	 The themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity.Yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending.
1.0 	 It is still relevant today, and I must chalk up the poor reviews I see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies.
0.86 	 I pulled down a VHS box from my vast collection - many unseen - and picked out a movie, based on the box art, I thought would be fun, and yes, bad.
1.0 	 Prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box.
0.96 	 I sat down and watched, and lo!
0.87 	 and behold!, found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind.
0.98 	 Fortunately, I reversed mine quickly and soon realized I was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total.
0.96 	 Prison tells the story of an old, dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns.
0.94 	 It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners.
0.63 	 Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead.
0.98 	 There are a few excessively shot gore scenes - the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes.
0.96 	 The acting is uniformly decent.
0.52 	 The script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these.
0.63 	 Give Prison a break(get it).
0.98 	 Whenever I see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for Eddie Murphy'.
0.74 	 I don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts, at all.
1.0 	 Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless.
0.99 	 There's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.<br /><br />Yes it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where Hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends.
0.75 	 You have to understand, certain things we today would view as sexual, back then would be considered innocent.
0.94 	 Most people didn't think of anyone viewing children sexually attractive, other than teenage boys lusting over teenage girls.
0.99 	 To them it wasn't sexual.
0.52 	 Mind you this was before we had internet, TV, etc...
0.83 	 Most sex crimes weren't openly brought up.
0.69 	 Yes very sad.
0.71 	 But it is kinda sad today, for even I too can see this film as anything other than what it was intended, innocent and funny.
0.82 	 When I saw Shirley dance like that and the boys eye balling her, yes I felt disturbed.
0.98 	 Those children didn't know what sex was.
0.98 	 In the eyes of the average adult back then, this was no more sexual then if Shirley was playing house.
1.0 	 However the child is merely pretending.
1.0 	 I don't blame the child for wanting to act like an adult.
0.71 	 In all honesty, our media has made a lot of things seem back then seem sick and wrong.
0.74 	 But I truly believe this movie isn't one of them.
1.0 	 When you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other, the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old Amitabh Bachchan romances a 34-yr old Tabu.
1.0 	 The locales of London as captured in rainy season are captivating.
0.98 	 By the end of first half, romance completed and mission accomplished.
0.98 	 Therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl's father to the extent that he goes for a Satyagrah is really a test of patience.
0.99 	 There is an equally strange climax about how he gives in.
1.0 	 Nonetheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances.
1.0 	 Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon.
0.99 	 I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's Christmas special "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas".
0.55 	 Some Gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but they need to compare it to DiC's 2002 release of "Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge" for then, they will find the second season to be absolute gold.<br /><br />Being a Gadget fan, I couldn't resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that wasn't Gadget Boy-related.
0.69 	 I purchased the film, and I swore to myself that I'd be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series.
0.64 	 I was not even prepared for what I was about to watch.<br /><br />There was barely a shred of the original show still intact.<br /><br />Here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie: *The humor is non-existent from the original series.<br /><br />*Penny and Brain (originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget) are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals.<br /><br />*The original music by Saban & Levy is not there, and the score that exists is sub-par.
0.97 	 *Don't expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets which made the show so endearing, such as gadget-copter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallet,gadget-coat (which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing), as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets.
0.99 	 All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa.<br /><br />*Chief Quimby is now very short-tempered and even mean to Gadget.
0.98 	 OK, here goes...<br /><br />*Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget.<br /><br />*In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series: the Great Wambini (classic "Gadget" villain from the second season, voiced by Louis Nye).<br /><br />Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie?
0.93 	 Life is about making choices and living by those choices.
0.94 	 Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson.
0.86 	 The lesson learned here: keep to the original formula!
0.95 	 True Gadget fans should steer clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed.<br /><br />Hopefully, DiC and Shout!
1.0 	 Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1," containing the first 22 episodes of the series.
1.0 	 As a true Gadget fan, lover of 80's animation and many of DiC's programs, I urge you the viewer to purchase "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVD's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories.
1.0 	 Rather than move linearly from beginning to end, this story line of a gay couple impacted by AIDS "orbits" in time around their "perfect day."
0.98 	 The film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced.<br /><br />The narration has its lyrical moments, particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced.
0.98 	 On their second accidental encounter, clearly smitten with each other, sensitive Phillip encourages a reluctant Guy to tell him about his difficult week.
0.5 	 But the moment Guy begins to open up, Phillip, an English Major, blurts out "You're not a Crisis Fairy, are you?"
0.88 	 Later, watching his lover's naked, chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him, our young Shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words, "The way you cut through space....I can't even describe it"--but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought.
0.87 	 and "You make Florence Nightingale look like Nurse Ratchet."
0.9 	 Unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller-flattened than they need to be.
0.83 	 It's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether's perimeter.<br /><br />The plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film.
0.94 	 It does seriously explore 1980's US middle class gay life: first encounters, courting, coupling, nesting, the complexity of open relationships, friction and fracturing, dissolution, physical abuse, rapprochement, forgiveness, terminal illness, death and survival.
0.99 	 Leads Phelan and Spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time.
0.94 	 Their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film's painful weaknesses.
0.75 	 The decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out-of-sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility, and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear.<br /><br />Could I recommend the film?
0.95 	 For easy going viewers in serious need of an AIDS survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty-pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in, maybe.
1.0 	 But better written alternatives exploring the impact of AIDS on relationships of that era include: Philadelphia, And the band played on, Longtime companion, Angels in America, An early frost, Parting glances, Love!
0.97 	 Valour!
0.84 	 Compassion!
0.51 	 and even Jeffrey.
0.74 	 When the guy who was in on a bank heist of $40 million in gold dies, his cell mate is used as "Bait" to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner (by having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge).
0.98 	 Well acted and good enough plot.
1.0 	 But come on...Janice is accidentally overheard telling someone "I don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it IS artistic"...there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit the Frog then the father doesn't want to hear it...Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?)
0.97 	 War is hell.
1.0 	 I have to say when William McInnes first appeared I though, that is one crappy actor!
0.99 	 He was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh.
0.65 	 First of all; it's very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from positions of guns, germs and steel.
1.0 	 In the Japan there isn't huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the top world economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, country with rich oil resources, there are only middle-low success.
0.98 	 <br /><br />In the end of movie Daimond declared, that it's very important to understand factors of guns, germs and steel, to UNDERSTAND.
0.99 	 Maybe the main factor of world's difference is not geography, but people ability to understand and use things?
0.99 	 The mental ability to understand.
0.61 	 End Game started well, the least said about the end the better.
0.73 	 Stephen King was raised on flicks like this.
0.98 	 They are meant to be fun, cheaply made and hopefully: a few good scares.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is... all it ever will be.<br /><br />Stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash.
1.0 	 This UK psychological thriller is known in the United States as CLOSURE.
0.72 	 Exploitation of X-Files' Gillian Anderson, who plays an attractive middle aged businesswoman of substance named Alice.
0.98 	 She must attend a business party and invites Adam(Danny Dyer), who just installed a security system for her, to be her escort.
0.98 	 On the way home, speeding through the woods on a narrow lane, Alice's auto collides with a deer.
0.97 	 When the identities of their attackers are discovered, Alice and Adam set out to exact revenge...brutal revenge.
0.98 	 The couple at times find themselves at odds on how to deal with the ruthless attackers.
0.97 	 He reveres surfers and the surfing/beach lifestyle, but doesn't whitewash it either.
1.0 	 I must say that the best bit was right at the end, when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames!
0.68 	 I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb.
0.92 	 Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view "The Luzhin Defence" as a movie.
0.98 	 Even her worst .
0.75 	 I will stop here to avoid the spoiler.
0.86 	 About the only thing I liked about this film is that there was JUST enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end...
1.0 	 The dream-like quality, so closely linked to nature, is beautifully captured here, but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child, one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold (waves on a beach, grasses and flowers, spiders etc).
0.98 	 The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine.
0.95 	 There is a LANGUOR to the film that is in opposition to what SHOULD be a very tense time in an adolescent life.
0.66 	 When you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything BUT languorous!
0.93 	 There are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film...SPOILERS HERE - first when Logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit.
0.81 	 The first reason I liked it is because the person who did the voice-over of "Leah" was the most convincing actor in the entire film.
0.97 	 (It made me think of Claire Danes from My So-Called Life ...the voice even sounded like Claire.)
0.98 	 And what I especially liked was the fact that Rodeo only pretended to play along... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally!
0.98 	 In the meantime, if he can get away from van Sant's influence, it might do him a world of good.
0.59 	 I think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci; concerning Mr. Kamar Del's Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his "Valley of the Dolls".
0.97 	 My rating is 1 and I still think it is well paid, but since we cannot give a O....
0.95 	 Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members.
0.94 	 However, no single bullet is used, hardly any gangfights are involved in Election.
0.98 	 The good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars.<br /><br />2/10
0.94 	 I loved the story, which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending.
0.83 	 The acting was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur.
0.85 	 I could go on, but what's the point.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it.
0.87 	 The plot of this movie hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father.
0.7 	 I don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else's daughter.
0.52 	 You couldn't see into his eyes at all.
0.98 	 Or, as they say in the biz, my girlfriend's brother had the remote and the rest is history.
0.91 	 Yeah, this was charming and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming "The Birds" but in 2005 it just looks low budget.
0.86 	 Had this movie been made a few years later, I would have given it a lower score.
0.78 	 While many are familiar with the story, I won't elaborate further as I don't want to ruin the film.
0.65 	 Just suffice to say that it's very creepy!
0.99 	 I was originally very excited to see this movie.
0.5 	 Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie.
0.7 	 And I fully agree.
1.0 	 It was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries.
0.87 	 Come on Lionsgate.
1.0 	 You've had amazing films, but this one sunk.
0.96 	 Skip this and watch "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest.
0.99 	 At any rate, what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes?
0.93 	 All-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently.
0.96 	 Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be.
0.98 	 If you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.
1.0 	 I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well, they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war.
0.98 	 Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and watching this, being told that this is how Americans truly are?
0.51 	 4/10
0.61 	 I was devastated as he was NOT sick--- he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary--- his carotids blew out-- he died behind our house.
0.98 	 There was a lot of speculation from police, cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in.
0.81 	 I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back.
0.96 	 I had three small children, no education, no financial support.
0.94 	 My in-laws didn't get it!
0.85 	 This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected!
0.96 	 I collapse, can not breathe, hyperventilate, and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain.
0.84 	 This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with.
0.92 	 <br /><br />The bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26 that I have clung to, that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for, that God's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God-- I need not speak.
0.99 	 I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so.
0.84 	 Sometimes, the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain.
0.99 	 While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities.
0.97 	 Both were made just a few years apart, both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies.
0.99 	 However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different.
0.9 	 The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio.
0.99 	 Plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class.
0.99 	 It's sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
0.63 	 The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor.
1.0 	 I was intrigued, at first, by the idea of Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to "find" their capacity for love.
0.78 	 Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment.
0.89 	 Dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask.
0.97 	 As a monk, Boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquer (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) -- when he leaves his "marriage to god" the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion.
0.95 	 The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past.
0.9 	 I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September.
0.54 	 The story was non-Western, but I think we are all used to this from many other movies.
0.91 	 It wasn't at all hard to follow.
0.96 	 The acting by the leads was weak, but other people were quite good.
0.71 	 Cain's very American novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness (the lead character Cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is working in.
0.63 	 This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering, and people who learn that there is a time for fighting, a need to defend.
0.54 	 Good writing job for an action flick, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid.
0.98 	 Not an undue amount of gore or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that respect.
0.84 	 The very set-up of the film has us watching as Cody's young comrade, with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving Cody holding his lifeless, bloody body.
0.86 	 And, given the nature of war we know that Cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis.
0.99 	 So much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines Cody's persona is erased from viewer memory.<br /><br />Sans any family of his own Cody, like John Rambo, roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown USA in the guise of some place called Nevada City.
0.74 	 We know this since his CO practically declares him so as he order Cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war.
0.84 	 It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder.
0.98 	 How exactly was Cody 'respecting' Faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for?
0.97 	 Now that was a non-family value moment.
0.94 	 A moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on YouTube.
0.99 	 Of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as Cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the Xmas season, all CHEERING their cheaten' hearts and lips.<br /><br />We know little about Faith's fiancÃ© except that she professes her love for him, she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal (could have waited if any second thoughts), he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans.
0.91 	 No evil doers here.<br /><br />Asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son....' 'You are part of our family' literally days after they have met a stranger named Cody.
0.97 	 Most grossly when it applauds Cody's disrespect for Faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for.
1.0 	 By re-defining family as we know it to wit: accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you.'
0.89 	 Maruschka Detmers would never have won an Oscar for this performance, due to inconsistent directing, but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma.
0.83 	 And when I realized once more it wasn't even fiction, it all actually happened, I found myself in even more tears.
0.71 	 On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest one got killed, there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that.
0.81 	 I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original.
0.98 	 The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.
0.99 	 Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br /> It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles.
0.82 	 Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn).
0.77 	 I'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious CV.
0.95 	 This is, ostensibly, a movie about multiple grief.
0.99 	 As such, it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters.
0.71 	 The storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow.
0.99 	 In spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful.
0.6 	 That's not good either.
0.74 	 Why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller?
0.54 	 Where I am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased.
0.67 	 Strange and weird.
0.82 	 This is not the typical Mel Brooks film.
0.98 	 It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable.
0.7 	 Strange...
0.87 	 I like all this movie crew and dark humor movies; but didn't like this one at all!
1.0 	 Superior in every way to that over-produced fluff.
0.91 	 Silk Stockings turned out to be a big disappointment.
0.57 	 Was Peter Lorre ill during the making of Silk Stockings--he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines?
0.67 	 and "Oh, no here it comes"?
0.98 	 Carpenter takes elements from much, much better films (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them in here as if we are supposed to acknowledge and appreciate his trademark style.
0.73 	 What is lacking here is genuine suspense and energy.
0.99 	 <br /><br />For better Carpenter films, stick to the tried and true classics-- The Thing, Halloween, and They Live.
1.0 	 For better masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and Dreams in the Witch House.
0.89 	 Hank, however, is divorcÃ©e who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bills, and endless amount of child support payments.
0.58 	 Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it.
0.72 	 How?
0.98 	 In other words, there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse.<br /><br />10/10
0.78 	 Its a shame really, as I quite like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer.
0.99 	 I was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together!!
0.98 	 Ten Stars?
1.0 	 Come on....I won't even give some of the greats ten stars, as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect.
0.99 	 This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout.<br /><br />Watch it if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably similar to mine.<br /><br />1/10
0.83 	 The tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better.
0.77 	 walking...walking...walking!!!
0.99 	 oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself.
1.0 	 some bad acting cheesy looking London
0.58 	 You don't really know what is always going on in the dark scenes and for a film that is shot on Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty grain to deal with.
0.51 	 As with Nathan Schiff movies, it's just too much.
0.51 	 Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it.
0.99 	 Is this a classic like it says?
0.99 	 Is it worthy of the two discs worth of praise?
0.98 	 But it is a good first try.
0.71 	 A boy fighting off spies/terrorists when he's home alone in a Chicago suburb with the chickenpox?
0.74 	 Will they ever get a decent job again?
1.0 	 They had a nice house in Bristol.
0.99 	 Dougray had a nice boat.
0.83 	 Jennifer looked nice in a little outfit.
0.88 	 But how come the sister got all the men?
1.0 	 It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs",...): a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues.
0.58 	 This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction avoiding the dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the horsey-faced Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into an horror movie.
0.98 	 Posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body.
0.88 	 She's worth your time, even if you don't understand the denouement.
0.72 	 "I'm a cartoon!"
0.6 	 "You're an illustration!"
0.9 	 The film errs with the character of John Willie, played by Jared Harris.
0.6 	 John Willie never met Bettie Page and was not involved in photo shoots with the Klaws.
0.99 	 The story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know Bettie.
0.51 	 It does tend to exaggerate Bettie's notoriety.
0.98 	 The ending is rather a let down.
0.93 	 It feels rather abrupt.
0.96 	 He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself.
0.53 	 <br /><br />Once out flying over the desert, Mark spots a car from the air.
0.59 	 Both films have a rambling, vague quality, along with complicated meanings and characters.
0.88 	 Frechette was as reckless in person, as his character was in this film.
0.99 	 While serving his prison sentence, Mark died an ignoble death.
0.83 	 He was killed by a 150 lb.
0.98 	 weight, which fell on him when he was weightlifting.
1.0 	 My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD.
0.96 	 The first season was must-see TV for us.
0.96 	 But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss.
0.82 	 Why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things?
0.98 	 Additionally, my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy.
0.93 	 It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family.
0.88 	 He basically would just do what MGM gave him.
0.99 	 The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was.
0.86 	 The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years.
0.82 	 I had high hopes for this movie, because I enjoyed the book so much.
1.0 	 The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival.
0.7 	 Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed.
0.93 	 Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world.
0.98 	 I strongly recommend that you read the book.
1.0 	 There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply awful Jennifer Lopez.
0.98 	 Please do not confuse the two movies.
0.52 	 The Hollywood version is the exact opposite.
0.66 	 I was aghast when I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version and who was starring in it.
1.0 	 It's typical Hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it's worst.
0.9 	 The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon.
0.78 	 Certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance, but half of the movie's tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in Japan.<br /><br />Please try to see this movie in it's original form, not the terrible full screen.
0.68 	 And please DO skip the US remake....it's a shallow travesty in comparison to the original Japanese movie.<br /><br />Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new US remake.<br /><br />Speaking of foreign films, I'll make a few quick recommendations: 1.Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, outstanding film!
0.83 	 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic!
1.0 	 Mr Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual).
0.99 	 First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding.<br /><br />Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to the three "American Pie Presents" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie?<br /><br />I also have a few other questions too.<br /><br />Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources?
0.55 	 Why has this not been released?
0.99 	 I kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn't been.
0.93 	 How wrong can a girl be!
0.72 	 You will chose a favourite, you will be shocked, you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens.
0.71 	 And it doesn't stop there, they have a final shock for you.<br /><br />It also makes you question reality TV and if you would watch.
0.86 	 I just kept waiting for it to get better.
1.0 	 I don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could have just been the film.
1.0 	 Not cheap, just hokey.
0.76 	 Also, it needed a little more suspense.
0.98 	 The movie reached that moment then faded away; kind of like a false climax.
0.99 	 This movie needs to have a Director's cut that tries to fix these problems.
1.0 	 I really liked ZB1.
0.5 	 I don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism.
0.76 	 At first I was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to ZB1's 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer 'events' in ZB3.
0.52 	 It's all talking.<br /><br />2.
0.82 	 And the exposition is indeed epic!
0.93 	 Of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about.<br /><br />As the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the SUV, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them.
0.75 	 Eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage.
0.55 	 Six GIs, about to be send home and discharged, get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia.
0.86 	 Behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck.
0.88 	 Their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley (David Janssen) to graduate research student (Richard Long).
0.98 	 James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood.
1.0 	 Richard Long has a nice blond girl friend.
0.96 	 But they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy.<br /><br />Then a dark, shifty-looking, mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) shows up and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group.<br /><br />Guess what happens.
0.5 	 First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash.
0.91 	 Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue.
0.85 	 Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths.
0.96 	 Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point.<br /><br />By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled, particularly Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, too, although he must explain to her what "love" is.
0.99 	 Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York?
0.55 	 Who's paying her utility bills in the hotel?
0.98 	 Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe?
0.99 	 How come she speaks American English so well?
0.95 	 In Lewton's "The Cat People", for instance, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it.
0.61 	 A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps.
0.64 	 Something or someone is following her.
0.94 	 Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her.
0.65 	 A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection, for instance, and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him.
0.94 	 As a matter of fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful.
1.0 	 Furthermore, they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals.
0.99 	 You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity?
0.85 	 Try a six-lined racerunner.
0.76 	 Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other minor masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy.
0.98 	 This is about love but not stupid things like in "notting hills" or those kind of movie.
0.83 	 This is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling...
0.68 	 I have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there...
0.94 	 I'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best.<br /><br />Franck in France
0.98 	 Now, the latter was not a movie that I envisioned as having a sequel.
0.92 	 I assume that you've seen the original, so I won't explain it.
0.66 	 One day, the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school.
0.95 	 But this is no ordinary toy.
1.0 	 I saw it a second time, and I was somewhat bored in the slow scenes.
0.91 	 Sid (the sloth) is not all that flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie.
0.98 	 It is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring.
0.67 	 Simple story... why say more?
0.99 	 It nails it's premise.
1.0 	 We see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable.
0.93 	 In the early 60s, no one had seen such stuff...
0.97 	 I have always been a fan of the show so I'll admit that I am biased.
0.8 	 When the show's run ended, I felt like too many questions remained unanswered.
0.84 	 This movie to me felt like closure.
0.66 	 If you are or ever have been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
0.62 	 Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department, and takes firefighting seriously.<br /><br />As we watch Wallace's rather dull life proceeding, suddenly there comes something new and jarring: a traveling carnival comes to town.
0.66 	 He's a clown, but he has a special talent.<br /><br />So does Wallace.
0.8 	 I think enough of it to have a copy in my library.
0.75 	 To me, it seemed that even the Author of the book favored Caroline.
1.0 	 Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit, I mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out.
0.95 	 And near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked.<br /><br />So if your a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself), check this out.
1.0 	 Yes there are great performances here.
0.97 	 During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance.
1.0 	 The movie itself is very unbelievable.
0.95 	 A doctor see a woman clearly under strong medication, is denied to examine her, gets kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet?
0.66 	 And you thought Rohmer was deadly.
0.97 	 Story takes place in the small German town of Klineschloss where the bodies have been piling up completely drained of blood and with suspicious puncture marks.
0.97 	 I'm the first to admit that this film is downright clumsy at times but it's practically impossible to resist a film that has a cast like this including Frye who is pretty much doing his Renfield role only this time he befriends bats and strokes them and keeps them in his pocket for safe keeping!
0.94 	 One thing that just doesn't make sense is the mind control that Dr. Otto has over Emil as the film never explains this and I had a strong sense that this was some sort of nod to "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" but on the other hand it's probably just the weakest part of the script.
0.87 	 All of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie.
0.64 	 If you've ever read the book, I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of "Lord of the Rings" equivalence.
0.9 	 People have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script.
0.73 	 He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature.
0.98 	 The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people.
0.72 	 The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country, possibly the world.
0.74 	 Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses.<br /><br />Anywho, I think it's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production.
0.65 	 The youngster portraying 'Frits' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him.<br /><br />Early on in the film we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father.<br /><br />The climactic scene where Frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster; simply standing his ground and repeating 'Liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget.<br /><br />The films only weak point is the rather clichÃ©d 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book.
1.0 	 True The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked.
0.74 	 I even like the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 8/10
0.98 	 (There isn't much in the way of spoilers, since there isn't a plot to reveal, but still, I guess I describe some of what happens so...) This is it.
0.99 	 This is THE most nonsensical film I've ever seen.
1.0 	 There are simply no words to describe this movie, although "bizarre" "ridiculous" and "ego trip" are pretty close.
1.0 	 the opening half hour or so are really, really weird music videos, with absolutely no plot or continuity, apart from that MJ falls into some from the previous.
0.82 	 Obviously, this leaves our as of yet mute (discounting songs) lead somewhat worried, and he manages to temporarily lose them.
0.95 	 Fortunate for him, because it means he can witness a falling star and, and again, I'm not making this up, turn into a claymation rabbit.
0.91 	 He uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them, but, for reasons I can't recall right now, they see through it (oh no!)
0.54 	 and the creepy chase begins again.
0.75 	 How does he get out?
0.62 	 Why, he turns into a robot, complete with weapons and shield.
1.0 	 I often find myself trying to imitate the tired, sighing accent of their butler, Hovis, or even the Scottish borough of Gordon.
0.64 	 We can't drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the Catscratch voices or the Hanson Brothers from the movie 'Slap Shot.'
0.97 	 Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking/expanding machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) get ready for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall).
0.85 	 Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett), and his kids Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to look after Adam while his parents are away, but as luck would have it (and the title would lead you to expect), the grown-ups are accidentally zapped by Wayne's shrinking ray.
0.91 	 Meanwhile, some of the unemployed men take demeaning make-work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment.
0.96 	 Emory tearfully asks "What did I do wrong?"
0.96 	 Early in the morning they break into the mill, fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives, producing in one shift enough high-quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall, top to bottom - something the plant manager thought was impossible.
0.96 	 The manager asks Emory: "Can you do this every day?"
1.0 	 Emory is forced to nod "No" and the manager asks: "Then what were you trying to prove?"
0.91 	 I just don't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here.
0.81 	 Jeez.
1.0 	 It is mindless, it isn't polished and it is (as I am reading) wasted on some.
0.53 	 This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group, likely the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel.
0.94 	 I just don't get it.
0.71 	 The jokes work on more then one level; if you didn't get it I know what level you're at.
0.91 	 This could have been a very good film, if I had been able to watch it.
0.97 	 The hand held camera was very bouncy.
1.0 	 But we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film, giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa.
0.63 	 The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it.
0.98 	 The acting seemed very authentic.
0.52 	 However, had all four youths been more physically imposing, the later scenes in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all.
0.98 	 Some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes, or the abrupt ending.
1.0 	 The only half-entertaining element is the landscape photography; but anyone could point a camera at the Australian outback a get memorable shots.
0.99 	 David Chase's "The Sopranos" is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory.
0.93 	 Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion, it's devoid of a soul.
0.81 	 As anyone reading likely knows already, James Gandolfini *IS* Tony Soprano, a big, fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife, and two bratty, sh*t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America (that's New Jersey, by the way).
0.77 	 Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer, he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of "Saturday Night Live" skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates.
0.93 	 Allowing characters to be who and what they are, without judgment, is something American TV hardly allows.
0.76 	 But Chase - and his entourage of money-gorged, Emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave, nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of (even obviously fictionalized) organized crime (a la "The Godfather").
0.97 	 Instead, Chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony, his wife, and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week (or should I say month after month.
0.57 	 Or is it year after year?
1.0 	 More than ever, I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p*ssed at this show.
0.95 	 It's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book (DantÃ©'s "Inferno" springs to mind).<br /><br />People on IMDb love to claim that there's nothing good on television, and therefore "The Sopranos" is a breath of fresh air.
0.66 	 Are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch "The Shield"?
0.99 	 How about the (still good) "The West Wing"?
0.99 	 Or the brilliantly acted (if erratically written) "Boston Legal"?
1.0 	 What about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades, "Arrested Development"?
0.9 	 to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be.<br /><br />You want good television?
0.99 	 Watch "Homicide: Life on the Street."
0.68 	 Or "Murder One".
0.9 	 Or "Picket Fences".
0.95 	 Or even Chase's prior show, "Northern Exposure."
0.95 	 If you're already among "The Sopranos"'s legion of brain-washed fans and critics, it's too late for you.
0.92 	 While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease.
0.81 	 He must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive!
0.95 	 I don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews, what do people expect?
0.78 	 Anyway, I really like this film.
0.57 	 The star of the film are unquestionably Rick Bakers Special Make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent, and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible CGI makes them even better.
0.9 	 Photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough.
0.93 	 The ending, set in a large factory of some sort, is pretty downbeat so don't expect any happy ending.
1.0 	 Also, the script doesn't really do anything with the premise, he just walks around melting and killing, with his friend trying to stop him, maybe a bit too simple.
1.0 	 Personally I think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion, her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too, it looks and sounds totally ridiculous!
0.87 	 She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time.
0.97 	 Leslie Howard's performance as the weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I don't see how any actor could hold their own against Ms. Davis's performance.
0.91 	 I've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg.
0.62 	 Scary Movie, loads of Scifi spoofs etc.)
0.56 	 I give a 9 of 10.
0.99 	 The only reason I can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the DVD, so there's almost no chance for non-Swiss to understand.
0.8 	 Saw this as previous viewer by accident, I have watched it twice now.
0.91 	 No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people, who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride.
0.51 	 She finds Tarzan and Jane, who try to protect her.
0.72 	 Even the "great" Robert Florey can't aid this one.<br /><br />*1/2 (of four)
1.0 	 His matter-of-fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus.
1.0 	 He comes across likable, unassuming, pragmatic.
0.58 	 There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches.
1.0 	 When Noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film and would say that you're probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or CD to listen to in the car.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars...and I'm in a generous mood today.
0.62 	 Sure, it's kinda low budget, but it's a non-stop comedic tour de force.
0.69 	 If you get a chance to see this movie do so.
0.8 	 Not because it's funny or anything mundane like that but because it's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good, though maybe not clean, fun.
0.79 	 He talks FOR them and, even then, JUDGES them.
0.95 	 This piece is flawed to it's roots, to it's ideology and it's a real shame it's considered a great film.
0.99 	 Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic.
0.82 	 Whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny.
0.96 	 When they catered to the junior high school crowd, any sense of self respect was tossed out the window.
0.95 	 I have watched them in comedies since 1998.
0.98 	 What's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been "performers" whose best days were NEVER.<br /><br />The death of American cinema has been a slow one.
1.0 	 Whatever happened to real humor?
0.88 	 Go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves.
0.75 	 And who's brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?<br /><br />Sean Carrigan, the "man of the hour" of "The Next Action Star" shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series.
0.9 	 A one-note johnny, Sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well, but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film.
0.93 	 His dumb-but-lucky routine gets old as there really isn't anything about the character to root for.<br /><br />But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden, rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot.
0.52 	 Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film?
0.83 	 I kept expecting her to quote Arnie.
0.85 	 Her character "performance" can be compared only to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered," though not nearly as well-developed.
0.99 	 Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately, Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast, but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo.
0.63 	 Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States up for its dishonesty, subterfuge, and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination.
0.78 	 Quite what the woman's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained, but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details.
0.97 	 It leaves the audience guessing; we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter, but we don't know who, or what, it is.
0.96 	 This tale is about a hammy horror film star that, unimpressed by his latest film's technical side, goes out and buys himself a cloak.
0.99 	 Naturally, this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak.
0.52 	 That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film.
0.98 	 Also, look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula.
0.86 	 I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery.
0.87 	 But I did really like the concept.
0.89 	 If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie.
0.85 	 Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.<br /><br />In short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I.
0.84 	 This was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop-off-the-screen effects.
0.89 	 Tambor would go on to star on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's box office smash "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", while Guttenberg followed this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon".
0.95 	 I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan.
0.98 	 I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.<br /><br />It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines.
0.98 	 The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two.
0.97 	 She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his.
0.68 	 After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive.
1.0 	 Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out.
0.8 	 This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens.
0.9 	 <br /><br />It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me.
0.89 	 So I had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater.
0.79 	 Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.
0.67 	 One of the few shows I make point of watching.
0.92 	 The shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they're too darn normal!!
0.78 	 I really can't wait until the next show, something I haven't felt for any show in a long time.
0.91 	 Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed.
0.87 	 At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how.
0.87 	 They are not alone in this place.
0.56 	 The courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic, but was real enough to be entertaining.
0.5 	 Being a military pilot I could relate to many of these parts.
0.96 	 Believe me, being a movie-freak, I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen.
0.9 	 I can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany, where normally the criteria are real tough (e.g.
1.0 	 kill-bill (brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18).
0.84 	 I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up, and I thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do.
0.82 	 This is a no budget student project (and not a particularly good one), released on video/dvd to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover).
0.59 	 I want my money back under the trades description act!
0.93 	 (And in no particular order!
0.96 	 Maybe I missunderstand - the doom and gloom felt by many teenagers really does disappear if they deal with it (**) - maybe the film is trying to send even that message too - well worth doing.<br /><br /> What is the film trying to say?
0.93 	 Parents: Don't try too hard!
0.92 	 Try to remember that your support is the key to their well being.<br /><br /> It sounds simplistic doesn't it?
0.92 	 Sometimes the film feels like that too but it's then that you notice how much is being being challenged and uncovered.<br /><br /> The film is a classic.<br /><br />(**) - Not the problems themsleves.
0.81 	 Can't recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy.
0.84 	 (You must look up the movie "Clockwatchers" ).
0.82 	 It's too weird that they're actually in a happy marriage.
0.98 	 So he chases her off, there she goes, and Cooper is in charge of the kids.
0.77 	 Then the wife comes back, wants the kids, and the film ends with a coin flip that'll decide the fate of the children.
0.88 	 Sorry Boon, your legacy was tarnished with this flop.<br /><br />Short Film #2 <br /><br />MORE SPOILERS <br /><br />Enter Dominique Corsaire.
0.81 	 Pretty girl, recently finished college, not sure what to do with her life.
0.89 	 Here's the rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark).
0.99 	 Nagurski, really, has just given up caring.
0.88 	 He watches muggings, assaults, you name it, and never intervenes.
0.6 	 Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of Taxi's run) gets in on the action, getting the police called on him, committing a crime, but having his lawyer there to protect him.
0.97 	 God bless America!
0.99 	 I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it.
0.61 	 This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways.
0.99 	 I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls.
0.71 	 My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree.
0.91 	 Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man.
0.96 	 He's not a story teller.
1.0 	 He's not a joke maker.
0.59 	 He's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams.
1.0 	 He plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, for instance -- are completely unfunny.
0.78 	 He has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect.
0.87 	 I gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8.
0.65 	 But a 10?
0.71 	 No way.
0.99 	 Featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast (Daphne Zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as Debbie, a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car!
0.98 	 And the main character, who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon, evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect.
0.73 	 Its full of no-name actors and actresses with little valuable plot.<br /><br />Anyway, this strange game goes on and our "hero" bets real money and does good at it.
0.5 	 Instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good.<br /><br />What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end.
0.77 	 I will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition.<br /><br />Overall, not even worth a $1 rental.
0.51 	 "D-"
0.9 	 Just as low-budget as that earlier film, but not nearly as fun as I had with it.
0.9 	 I loved the book its based off of, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie.
0.61 	 If you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it, and you'll see what I mean.
0.61 	 If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE!
0.64 	 They took so many lines from the first movie, Its hard to tell which movie you're watching.
1.0 	 he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie.
0.85 	 just trust me on this, maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films........ 1/10.......j.d Seaton
0.98 	 Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG!
0.91 	 the music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is worth the price of admission alone.
0.85 	 I got my judgment teeth pulled out so I didn't feel very good.<br /><br />I ended up liking it big time.
1.0 	 I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day.
0.89 	 And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there ain't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it.
0.52 	 These bimbos from the USO set women's liberation back light years.
0.75 	 I was really stunned how much a film, that's over 60 years old could impress me.
0.87 	 I wondered how much work this must have been for van Dyke.
0.76 	 I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it.
0.85 	 Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic' anymore?
0.99 	 It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr.
0.7 	 Right.
1.0 	 It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene.
0.77 	 But (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.<br /><br />It ends very stupidly.<br /><br />All in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it.
0.93 	 Tune in for that one then turn it off.
0.97 	 I just watched this movie and I've gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there!!!
1.0 	 A friend lent me this movie and I watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story.
0.63 	 He was supposedly going to be hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot... well, we never see Costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie!
0.66 	 <br /><br />Costner runs into a Texan (James Gammon) selling a horse to a big Mexican businessman and Costner tags along for a ride.
0.84 	 Why did they have Gammon's character?
0.93 	 I only watched this because a friend owned it and let me watch it...
0.98 	 I LOVE Jack's jokes like 'The clichÃ© is...' or "Over the top clichÃ© guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky...".
0.97 	 Good thing Jack's not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania!!!
1.0 	 Only problem, I feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation.
0.96 	 It means no worries!
0.8 	 Resnais, wow!
1.0 	 The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour.
1.0 	 The opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch.
1.0 	 The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party.
0.65 	 This is all in the first 60 seconds.<br /><br />Then the music starts.
0.58 	 I'll tell you why.
0.91 	 With bad songs.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, I admit, excellent.
0.57 	 Maybe tomorrow I'll try watching the end.
0.84 	 I have more important things to do.
0.51 	 She manages to give us a complete human being, even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you wouldn't want to live with.
0.71 	 I just watched this movie on Starz.
0.63 	 All in all I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane.
0.93 	 This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard.
0.92 	 To my surprise, he's been around since the late 90's.
0.65 	 I could say the same about Liv Tyler.
1.0 	 Although I've seen her do well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality.
0.96 	 Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton would be able to, but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode.
0.92 	 She's a fantastic actress, but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie.
0.94 	 Of course, let's not lie.
0.85 	 However, I'd be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur.
0.82 	 And the chemistry between Arthur and co-star William Powell is real and it's fun, romantic and involving.<br /><br />The story and screenplay by Anthonyu Vieller and John Wyne's production company partner, James Edward Grant ("The Angel & The Bad Man") is close to being up there with a Thin Man effort, but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.<br /><br />While it's not in the stratosphere of 'The Thin Man" movies (what else is?
0.98 	 This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word "f--k" the most number of times.
0.99 	 Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive.
0.97 	 This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster.
0.93 	 Crime does not pay for long!
0.99 	 I'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how "real" it is.
0.7 	 Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to tell with the over-the-top style of the whole show.
0.82 	 This movie bewilders me.
0.6 	 That in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first.
0.58 	 So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends.
0.73 	 Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow.
0.91 	 The structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out.
0.74 	 For the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Final Verdict <br /><br />The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson, if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his
 unique decisions.
0.54 	 As it was, I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life.
0.82 	 2.Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada .
0.99 	 If you only read a synopsis of the plot, this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's.
1.0 	 The story would seem quite contrived, the subject matter maudlin.
0.81 	 This one hearkens back to the days of the matinÃ©e, when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below.
0.87 	 The fourth of the series to be hospital-based, it's possibly the least of the genre.
0.91 	 "That leaves only one thing to offer you."
0.8 	 That said, Williams's description of premarital relations is priceless: "You don't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room, you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first!"
0.73 	 Not much of it makes sense, but that doesn't matter.
0.84 	 My friends and I reenact entire scenes.
1.0 	 Yes, it sounds like we're lame losers and we are ... but we're lame losers who have seen "Private Lessons II."
0.77 	 Am I satisfied with the ending?
0.79 	 I think I am.
0.99 	 Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured.
0.97 	 I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen.
0.84 	 Maybe she wasn't available though.
0.68 	 Voyager could have continued.
0.98 	 The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible!
0.58 	 Chakotay became my least favourite character.
0.95 	 and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time.
0.99 	 Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times.
0.8 	 from some characters.
0.86 	 In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus Virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations.
0.83 	 Also appearing are: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan.
0.75 	 Anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government.
0.51 	 2/10
0.67 	 Unless you're well oiled and in the mood to mock, don't view Santa Claus.
0.56 	 If you've seen this movie, you've been to Puerto Rico.
0.92 	 I've lived in Puerto Rico all my life, and have to shamefully admit that we (PR) are living a real chaos right now, drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day.
0.72 	 It was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lake), only instead of just killing women, he kills men also.
1.0 	 I gave the movie a rating of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when you'd notice nothing was wrong, like its being shot the way a film is usually shot, you wouldn't see the "live" camera shooting, but then, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes.
0.99 	 what went wrong?
0.97 	 Two different takes on the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there's something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers, and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality.
0.99 	 Even if you know where it's going, you still harbor hope that it WON'T "go there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating.
0.87 	 Okay, so we can't fathom why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER.
0.99 	 Yet these boys don't really seem angry.
1.0 	 They may say some things to indicate that they are, but in fact they didn't convince me that they had SOMETHING inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people.
0.69 	 that director Coccio wants me to have.
0.69 	 Anyway, rent or buy this movie, it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time.
0.69 	 At the end of the film, you too might be tempted to call out, Remember the Shaolin Temple!
1.0 	 It is enjoyable and fast-paced.
1.0 	 I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging.
0.76 	 More key is the style of the whole thing.
1.0 	 It is very slick and vibrant, and the backdrops are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich.
0.61 	 The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
0.94 	 Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much?
0.84 	 Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie?
0.52 	 But then again, that depends entirely on your sense of humour, so there is no sense in arguing about that.
0.98 	 When the farmer drops them, they just stand there by the road, covered all over with cow s*** or whatever.
0.96 	 Which leads to the second point: the acting.
0.98 	 Thirdly, there is the plot .
0.62 	 More often than not, there is no real action, and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss (Bernsen) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even-tually, grudgingly, like each other.
0.77 	 Therefore, take my advice: watch this film, but if you don't chuckle, grin or smile during the first 10 minutes, forget it - it's not your type of film.
0.99 	 The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how, do tell me.
0.82 	 This 30 minute documentary BuÃ±uel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films.
0.88 	 First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here).
0.99 	 And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that BuÃ±uel favored, but with Western European style capitalism.
0.51 	 BuÃ±uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation.
0.78 	 That children are taught exactly what at school?
0.83 	 While there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman.
0.84 	 I don't know any family who is like that.
0.78 	 Is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up?
0.99 	 It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story.
0.77 	 The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle.
0.98 	 However, to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film.
0.84 	 Charity to those in need or not, 3.
1.0 	 She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that go nowhere, while Ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden.
1.0 	 Then he Marries Smith and they fly off to Brazil, which has become the staple finale of almost every British caper comedy since (Nuns on the Run?
0.65 	 A Fish Called Wanda?
0.99 	 If you love this you need to see better films.
0.96 	 The one we are witness of -the movie.<br /><br />For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside AroÂ´s mind, mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done.
0.63 	 We bought this film from a shop called Poundland.
0.62 	 We were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film No Big Deal an remade it.<br /><br />We expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube.
0.88 	 BORING is the main word that comes to mind.
0.69 	 Despite the exaggerated, stereotyped characters, the genuineness of the issues remains clear.<br /><br />Not only were those radical times of change, but also very confusing times.
0.99 	 They were confused too.
0.98 	 There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or even any mention of them.<br /><br />I think if you didn't live the decade, you might not have a sense of what the movie is about, the overall picture is a bit dim.
1.0 	 I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations, or else the film would have become a long, boring, documentary.
0.92 	 At least we can say we are not ashamed of it, that we learned and grew from it, and that for once, a generation shaped and changed America... for the better.
0.76 	 Somewhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah gets thrown in.
0.97 	 The film starts off with a lonely Cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you.
0.98 	 No missteps here.
0.89 	 Hopefully, he takes on more directorial jobs, for he is one director to look out for.
0.54 	 I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of Canadian history, particularly the disservice done to the history of the Mounted Police in the Yukon.<br /><br />I'll leave it to Pierre Berton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definitive history of the Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /><br />The American idea of an untamed frontier, subdued by individual heroes armed with six-guns, was continued in The Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the American west - Wyoming this time - driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country.
0.84 	 When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs shack is empty.<br /><br />"Where is the constable?
0.52 	 Trouble with the Chilkats," someone replies.
0.98 	 He's got a real tough job, that constable.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state British North America has ever seen.
0.84 	 The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the Klondike strike.
0.66 	 In true Canadian fashion, they laid down moral laws for the community.
0.83 	 "No man has yet taken a gun away from me," said the American.
1.0 	 The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless town run by Soapy Smith, the Denver confidence man, was remarkable.
0.81 	 But in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a community without any law, which a Soapy Smith character from Skagway Â he is called Gannon in the picture Â can easily control.
0.75 	 I represent the law in the Yukon Territory.
0.86 	 Now that you're here, we'll protect you.
0.97 	 "<br /><br />"There'll be a post established here in Dawson early in May.
0.78 	 "<br /><br />"What happens between now and May?
0.85 	 You going to be here to keep order?
0.75 	 "<br /><br />"Part of the time.
0.96 	 "<br /><br />"Pick yourselves a good man.
0.5 	 Swear him in.
0.99 	 His astonishing suggestion Â that an American town marshal, complete with tin star, be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under British jurisprudence Â is accepted.
0.94 	 Naturally they want to make Jimmy Stewart the marshal; he clearly fits the part.
0.87 	 But Stewart is playing the role of the Loner who looks after Number One and so another man is elected to get shot.
0.99 	 Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own.
0.98 	 <br /><br />
excerpt from Hollywood's Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
0.8 	 First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT.
0.73 	 What is it about?
0.65 	 Who the heck knows.
0.77 	 Most of the audience that attended the showing that I was at, felt pretty much the same way.
0.97 	 Dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers.
0.6 	 OK every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film (like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night) but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those - shall we say - naughty traits.
1.0 	 The views of Israel were great.
0.98 	 I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called the Emek (valley).
0.78 	 Soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters!
0.56 	 P Diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time.<br /><br />The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film.<br /><br />If you are a big Carlito's Way fan, I recommend you not watch this.
0.73 	 Complementary to the other reviews I have to add that I like the acting and the ending very much.
0.93 	 The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour.
0.94 	 It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good, funny story is to come.
0.97 	 It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness.
0.9 	 <br /><br />In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience.
0.92 	 I was amazed to hear that.
0.99 	 Am I living in the same world he lives in?
0.93 	 I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles.
1.0 	 Zvezda being a Russian war film, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, a lush score, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans.
0.92 	 Someone even recommended the show to me.
0.92 	 Due to the show's format, I'm happy I waited.
1.0 	 Then Tara and Sam get it on, despite each of them knowing that Sam is in love with Sookie.
0.59 	 One of the problems with the show, is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters.
0.78 	 They get high, and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of V. Another example is when Bill has to go to a vampire tribunal.
0.5 	 It doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog.
0.69 	 But the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself.
0.71 	 Then it's time to wrap up the murder story.
0.88 	 At the end of the penultimate episode, it's revealed that Renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer.
0.96 	 In the final episode, they shove Renee being the killer in your face.
0.99 	 I thought that was fine, as it adds to Renee being a fraud.
0.9 	 They show that Renee has the tape of Maudette with the vampire and his fiancÃ©e finds a tape in one of Renee's boxes about how to fake a Cajun accent.
0.6 	 They start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues.
1.0 	 Jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti-vampire church--which makes me care about him even less.<br /><br />It's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show.
0.97 	 I'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2, but if I watch it, I'll most likely wait for the season completion.
1.0 	 Oh, and as a cinematography buff, I give this film 100% in the cine dept.
0.64 	 I recommend any interested to see it: 8/10.
0.9 	 Not that it didn't have redeeming aspects
 For example, the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery.
0.94 	 Anyone not living on the East Coast should know the South doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the West.
0.98 	 <br /><br />One other thing in action pictures always puzzles me.
0.82 	 Why do they always make the "cocking" sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun?
0.65 	 It seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a "chuk-chich" signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire.
0.53 	 I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it.
0.95 	 Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film.
0.99 	 He failed thank God.<br /><br />The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin won't like her because she's ugly.
0.77 	 She claims that the film is "anti-feminist" when in fact it's just realistic.
0.93 	 Men more often than not go for looks over personality.
0.5 	 It's interesting to note her hypocrisy too.
0.96 	 She acted in it for Heaven's sake!
0.88 	 Blimey they've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made.
0.52 	 The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful.
0.53 	 Not too keen on this really.
0.57 	 I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good.
0.93 	 It's a idealist film and as a musician, feel slightly offended after watching it.
0.9 	 You've never seen anything like it.
0.87 	 <br /><br />By the time it was over, it was on my Top 10 list of All Time Great Movies.<br /><br />Disregard the slobbering right-wing fanatics.
0.99 	 I have seen most of Kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable.
0.98 	 Alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity.
0.88 	 However, these qualities are in painfully short supply in Alive.
0.95 	 The plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film.
0.96 	 Only recommended to very patient and determined Kitumura fans.
0.82 	 My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention shared an office with him.
0.53 	 The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer.
0.73 	 I've heard her re-tell them many times.
0.93 	 I've inquired her about a lot of things, and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to.
0.62 	 This is based on my mom's portrayal of him, all my readings on him, and the video tapes I've seen of him talking.<br /><br />First of all, the camera angles were horrible.
0.91 	 He wasn't as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, business like.
0.83 	 Same goes for his killings, as far as we all know.
0.54 	 This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK.
0.64 	 Which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it.
0.92 	 The only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye.
0.86 	 Not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people.
0.99 	 Plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like American fears of foreigners, issues of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts vs. civilization, and many other things.
0.96 	 Plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence.
0.56 	 Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders.
0.97 	 I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself.
0.83 	 ),comes back i think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now razing his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old).
0.96 	 And what about that Lex Luthor ?
0.95 	 Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ?
0.66 	 Please !
0.98 	 I was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did.
0.99 	 The movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic.
0.8 	 They never treat the audience like idiots.<br /><br />All the actors were solid in their performances.
0.76 	 As could be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate.
0.98 	 I was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy.
0.99 	 Come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!).
0.7 	 Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right.
0.8 	 It felt as though I'd watched dozens of episodes already, and then it hit me.....There's nothing new here!
0.88 	 I've heard that joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like that on friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline, ect.
0.9 	 Some were good on other shows (not here), and others are new to a profession they should have never entered.
0.81 	 He is confined to a wheelchair, and needs round-the-clock attention.
0.96 	 Rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there, seemingly by her father, Dixon Doss (Duvall).
0.95 	 Rick, now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her, is successful in having Dixon put on trial and sent to prison, but when he is freed by his local friends, Rick finds himself in a trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life.
0.97 	 The first-rate make-up f/x are every bit as gory, gross and upsetting as they ought to be.
0.99 	 Had I only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie, I would have passed.
1.0 	 The idea of a movie about a hit-man-seeing-a shrink-wanting-to leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love....sounds trite.
0.95 	 From the start of the movie, it's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders, before he even says a word.
1.0 	 EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of July.
0.57 	 LANDSCAPES are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.<br /><br />Go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.
0.82 	 I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my Japenese film class, but this film really blew me away.
1.0 	 Another post compared this show to I love Lucy.
0.72 	 <br /><br />After the damage the Nazi's did to England and the number of people they killed, I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced.
0.91 	 (And by the way, who else thinks "Morty" is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth?
1.0 	 It ranks right up there with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to horror value.
0.67 	 That'd be about as scary as "Morty.
0.88 	 )<br /><br />And then there's a scene where the "hero" hits his father's tombstone with---"a sledgehammer?"
0.6 	 someone might venture.
0.7 	 Oh brother!<br /><br />There's also a Native American guy who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently, does nothing except Morty-maintenance.
1.0 	 But for all his respect for and tenderness toward Morty, does Morty give a rat's hairy behind?
0.68 	 Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney!
0.99 	 Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place.
0.99 	 I first didn't want to watch this film, for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film...but as I recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinitÃ©"" which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (screenwriter of "prÃªte-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "PrÃªte-moi ta main", would be as good as "mensonges...".
1.0 	 While 2006's 'Hills' remake was one of the year's best, and truly frightening, horror films, this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment.
0.87 	 Surviving off travelers who wander into the region.
0.59 	 A grim reality soon befalls them, as they come to the realization that they're not alone.
0.61 	 And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.<br /><br />It doesn't take a genius to realize that 'Hills' has no legitimate reason to exist.
0.51 	 But because last year's remake was received well both at the box office and by critics, it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there's still money to be earned.
1.0 	 Originally, director Alexander Aja made Craven's cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience.
0.85 	 There's no style, no grit.
0.77 	 And with 'Hills', you reap what you sew.
0.76 	 Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past, but I'd never expect something like this from him.
0.63 	 The film's characters are one-dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense.
0.94 	 Even the deranged and instinct-driven villains, who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago, are met with indifferent.
0.7 	 Stick to the remake or Craven's original vision.
0.85 	 (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.)
0.98 	 the story DOESN'T make sense.
0.54 	 BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING.
0.96 	 Based upon the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film.
0.55 	 Half the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value.
0.56 	 This film is not good at all.
0.97 	 Amanda Peet has proven that she can act, as she was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'.
0.88 	 And for those of you who can't get off your pedestal, thats your choice.
0.9 	 I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection.
0.96 	 Boy, talk about failing to fulfill your early promise!
1.0 	 I saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s & 70s, yes it IS gruesome, and could be the progenitor of the "Faces of Death" series popular in the 80s & 90s.
0.87 	 Considering the state of so-called "driver education" these days, this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive.
0.59 	 I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s & 80s, and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class.
0.53 	 I found this film in the company library, showed it at the session, a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room!
0.95 	 This film, and another, "RED ASPHALT", is certainly reality in its most graphic form.
0.91 	 Mainly I think it's a film about an internet S&M "star" of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online.
0.52 	 She's murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death.
1.0 	 The local homicide division of Big City, USA is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic "as the real thing".
0.64 	 Wow.<br /><br />Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him.
0.79 	 Like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly.
0.86 	 That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.
1.0 	 "Steve"(Chris Hoffman)gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother Wes went missing.
1.0 	 While they are there, a reptilian creature in the shape of a man(reminded me a lot of the Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON)awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one.
0.88 	 A biker, Ellen Ripley-type time female bad-ass, Kat(Chase Masterson)has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in, while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage.
0.79 	 Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin.<br /><br />Thankfully, a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes.
0.97 	 First of all, let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously.
0.99 	 It's supposed to be a fun, yet stupid movie, that doesn't require one to think, only to enjoy it.
0.97 	 MOST DEFINITELY A TEN!!
0.54 	 He takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real.
0.65 	 It is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat.
0.96 	 Not to be missed.
0.94 	 The man bugs me so very bad - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin itself, but that's another story for some other time), as it almost did "Spirit".
0.96 	 I was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was... thankfully.<br /><br />Point #2: Brian Adams sucks...
1.0 	 The whole score was terrible...
1.0 	 The songs were unoriginal, generic, and poorly executed; not once did I find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible.
1.0 	 Every time one of the lame songs came on, I was turned off.
0.75 	 I almost thought I'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-American freedom style lyrics (I couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11).
0.95 	 In light of the native American aspects of the film, they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap.
1.0 	 I can't believe no better could have been done--I refuse to.
0.86 	 Had it not have been for this, I'd rank the film up more with Disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, don't bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking ;).
0.71 	 Too bad, it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians.<br /><br />I liked the art and animation, except for some things here and there... like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick/dark lines mainly near the end).
1.0 	 Anyhow, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent.<br /><br />OK, I'm falling asleep here so I'll sum it up before I start making less sense...<br /><br />Nice try on an epic film... it turned out mediocre though.
0.99 	 Matt Damon, you suck!
0.87 	 After the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (Michelle Joyner).
0.74 	 Quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside.
0.91 	 Two experienced climbers Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Tucker (Micheal Rooker) and a helicopter pilot (Janine Turner) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by Quaien and his men.
0.99 	 Now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek.
0.99 	 While Quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped Tucker to find the money.
0.56 	 Once Tucker finds the money, Tucker will be dead.
0.56 	 This was one of the biggest hits of 1993.
0.73 	 DVD has an running commentary track by the director with comments by Stallone.
0.99 	 Based on a premise by John Long.
0.53 	 Panavision.
0.93 	 Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there.
0.56 	 rather quick resolution at the end.
0.94 	 This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918.
0.84 	 All the standard clichÃ©s are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises.
0.98 	 Well made, but certainly NOT original!
0.82 	 And, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920!!
0.81 	 There are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess.
0.6 	 I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance.
0.73 	 Many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel), yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed.
0.83 	 *** from ****
0.79 	 Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are about to graduate from Holden University with Honors in lying, cheating and scheming.
0.93 	 The three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now, during final exams, these big-men-on-campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school.
0.75 	 The comedy in Slackers is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie.
1.0 	 Even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy.
0.93 	 Jason Schwartzman plays the freaky Ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low.
0.88 	 The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon though, she's not in the movie very much.
0.66 	 The film is very short at only 86 minutes long however, that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor.
0.61 	 So unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then Slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else.
1.0 	 OK, I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, I must admit: I really hated it.<br /><br />We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered at the very words "Watership Down"- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it.
0.73 	 Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across.
0.57 	 the financial disaster of 1930.<br /><br />The series follows Hitler and little else, apart from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl.
0.99 	 The tempo is at times drowsy, and the film does suffer from it, being approximately 2,5 hours long.
0.72 	 My sister bought this at a Wal-Mart a few years back when it was released, I saw it back then and thought it was okay.
0.96 	 Later "Twister" with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt comes out (or was it before?
0.66 	 I think it was '97) and did a better job overall.
0.82 	 But "Twister" was more silly fun; this is realistic with a message.
0.91 	 It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters, or a low-budget character study?<br /><br />John Schneider and Devon Sawa (he's the reason my sister bought it) star, and Devon Sawa, who went on to "Wild America," "Final Destination" and "Slackers" got his big break here.
0.73 	 So in a way, I was one of the first people to see him really take off.
0.69 	 "Night of the Twister" has the latter.
0.97 	 So you decide.<br /><br />I give it a 2.5/5...<br /><br />- John Ulmer
1.0 	 This is a movie about how men think women think about love.
0.72 	 Maybe if they actually WERE love stories it would have worked.
0.89 	 One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid.
0.66 	 So if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick, go ahead.
0.97 	 If you want to see them in something good, see Pryor's old standup act and Gleason in something better, like the Honeymooners.
0.67 	 The caretaker of the manor, Gary(Simon Peacock)warns Karen and her students to stay on the path and not to stray into the forest.
0.93 	 There's a myth regarding the Sawney Bean Clan, a ritualistic druid cannibalistic inbred family celebrate Samhain(the end of Summer, October 31st)"Feast of the Dead" where sacrifices are needed to appease the spirits.
0.92 	 Gary is supposedly clairvoyant, his cousin Pandora(Ginger Lynn Allen)tells us, because he was born on Samhain.
0.69 	 Funny, because he sure doesn't see outcomes well or even give advice accurately.
0.52 	 Most of the violence flashes across the screen quickly with not much dwelling on the breeder's acts of death towards his victims.
0.99 	 Lots of guts get pulled out during the fast edit cuts as one scene whisks to another.
0.92 	 Brandi-Ann Milbrant has the fortunate role of Shae, the quiet virgin smart girl(who is also quite hot)who we know will be the one chosen by the screenplay to survive.
0.75 	 Jenna Jameson drops by long enough to get her heart cut out of her chest(at least we see her breasts momentarily before her chest is opened up)with a few minor lines about two missing friends she's looking for.
0.72 	 It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed.
0.84 	 I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism.
0.88 	 "knock down dat wall,knock down dat wall and knock down dat #@$%#@$ wall."
0.99 	 "You shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny" or "Sounds like Johnnys getting laid".
0.87 	 I would just like to state that this may be biased, as I am a producer on the film.
0.7 	 Unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through.
0.97 	 How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons?
0.81 	 I give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap.
0.77 	 The little target is a mute child named Derek(William Thorne)whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face, causing him to land on a fireplace poker.
1.0 	 Mother Sarah(Jane Higginson)worries about her son's mental state, figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or, more importantly, talking, derives from watching her husband's horrific murder.
0.96 	 Still quite a heavy drinker(..often seen swigging Jack), Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids, but his creepy son Pino(Brian Bremer)hasn't and Derek he harbors angst towards.
0.84 	 Rooney's name adds an allure to the film, gaining it a notoriety, but his histrionics can only help so much.
0.76 	 I'm guessing that's the point, but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this..he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation, quite volatile, barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino, when not downing liquor.
1.0 	 Bremer is appropriately weird and "robotic" as Pino, longing to have Sarah as his mama.
0.9 	 The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing..Screaming Mad George's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film.
0.72 	 Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted, but that's not exactly an endorsement.
0.88 	 This film will be no exception to that rule.
1.0 	 The film does get a bit bogged down in the second half.
0.71 	 The German general being practically scared of his captured American private.
0.98 	 )<br /><br />One saving grace was a song performed at the "talent show" (how's that for irony?)
0.88 	 I bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store.
0.96 	 It was in almost mint condition, and I'd never heard of it before.
0.99 	 Clearly nobody else had either.<br /><br />I can't believe my luck.
0.64 	 Despite its enormous length (I had to watch it in two sittings) - it was like a book one couldn't put down.
0.87 	 If you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about, then you're in for quite the surprise.
0.78 	 Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline, but the actual film is anything but.<br /><br />As the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self Â this spells trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence.
0.55 	 And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene.
1.0 	 If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the "other" world.
0.57 	 Unfortunately, the design and construction aren't that inspired.
0.91 	 <br /><br />Spoiler Ahead!!
0.62 	 The same thing happens in genre film-making, as well; though, again, I'm referring to movies made outside the U.$.
0.62 	 I was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show I've seen in a while.
0.66 	 It gave me, once again, a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be governed.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that in Venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the eighty percent of the poor for decades, if not centuries.
0.95 	 They haven't even gone to jail.
0.5 	 It is not only History that Bites.
0.55 	 Spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc, but his 'dames' are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence.
0.92 	 When the penny finally drops his face is a picture.
0.96 	 Good to see that 50s censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line.
0.92 	 I disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as "just" entertainment.
0.92 	 Yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.<br /><br />In the 30s, Hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining *and* enlightening audience-pleaser after another, all without wasting a frame of film.
0.63 	 Dance, Fools, Dance -- one of *four* films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.<br /><br />With the lone exception of Lester Vail as flaccid love interest Bob Townsend, the supporting cast is uniformly strong.
0.97 	 If you have seen Friends, the writing will feel very familiar.
0.93 	 Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy setups.<br /><br />The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young (about 10 years old I think).
0.99 	 Now, they're in their mid-twenties, and they meet again on a class reunion.
0.84 	 This is where the series starts.<br /><br />A typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once.
0.95 	 If you're into this kind of in-your-face humor, then maybe you'll like this series.
1.0 	 For me it is a great turn-off.<br /><br />The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first few seasons.
0.97 	 There are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters.
0.71 	 It's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them.<br /><br />At least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out.
0.66 	 But in The Class, it seems it has run out of steam before it even started.
1.0 	 Some say Crocker's songs are the best bits, and they are certainly original, but "hilarious"?
0.99 	 The Adventures of Barry McKenzie will go down as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, for that matter, Mick Dundees!).
0.85 	 Any movie with "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in London,England,Paris,France,Rome,Italy,and anywhere in Germany.It may be an institution in the U.S. but it is practically unknown in Europe to the larger audience.
0.98 	 "National Lampoon's European Vacation" is unlikely to rectify that situation.
0.7 	 Clearly Mr Chevy Chase thinks he's funny, after all Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot at his jokes,but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out Â£2.50 for the privilege.
0.72 	 The fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.
0.78 	 I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again.
0.98 	 I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK.
0.79 	 Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean.
0.99 	 I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great.
0.97 	 With no fault to the actors (they all put on great performances), the overall story was not very well executed.
0.99 	 The movie opens with a great zinger: a crazy old guy forces a young Aborigine girl's car off the road.
0.93 	 While it is well acted, there's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it.
0.76 	 Why did this guy hate himself and the world?
0.66 	 Man!
1.0 	 DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four)<br /><br />If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable, don't see "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas."
1.0 	 It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville.
0.96 	 However, I will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who's from their Christmas.
0.87 	 There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces.
0.94 	 "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good-looking production.
1.0 	 The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream.
0.99 	 Although dazzling, I really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about.
0.97 	 His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss.
0.69 	 It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part.
0.78 	 This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas.
0.87 	 (This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) <br /><br />I really wanted this film to be good.
0.99 	 I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it.
1.0 	 Those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever.
1.0 	 Like all Miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy/sci-fi setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species.
1.0 	 Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time.
1.0 	 (though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) And the English voice acting is quite well done.<br /><br />But this film...just...isn't...good...
0.85 	 The characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians, to everyone in between.
0.61 	 Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen all there is.
0.93 	 And the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help.<br /><br />Then there's the music... Now, Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa doesn't do him justice.
0.68 	 I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.<br /><br />But wait!
1.0 	 There's a great message with this film, right?!
0.98 	 There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree.
0.91 	 But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it.
0.99 	 And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on, that's lame.<br /><br />If you're the kind of person who worships anime, enjoys 80's music, and plants a tree every Arbor day, you will probably like this film.
0.98 	 It has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at.
0.82 	 Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies.
0.62 	 The movie should have been aired as a Disney Channel original movie, that is FREE.<br /><br />The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music.
0.98 	 Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day.
0.94 	 These songs are so good.
0.99 	 Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
0.82 	 Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
0.8 	 Yeah, yeah, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black....and the good guys always win.
1.0 	 Now go home and hug your kids, and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel.
0.64 	 It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director.<br /><br />Ya see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL' bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy.
0.99 	 All those "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick, paying back a favor, or they have sold their souls to the devil.<br /><br />Rachael McAdams is beautiful....yup, that's it.
0.94 	 Go re-rent any of the Die Hard movies.
0.99 	 You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting.
0.77 	 This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one.
0.91 	 Well, what I got could have been found at your local "love toy" store.
0.74 	 You want to take over?"
1.0 	 Ri'Chard is great.
1.0 	 He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous.
1.0 	 He's one of my favorite actors.
0.99 	 I love Anne Rice.
0.81 	 I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book.
0.84 	 This is a little too"real" for me.
0.99 	 I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves.
0.86 	 I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums.<br /><br />The story line was wonderful.I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr.Brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.<br /><br />I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other.
1.0 	 I wasn't surprised at all, when I found out that the leading star was a kick boxer.<br /><br />There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends.
0.94 	 I recommend watching it, if you are in need of laughter.
0.99 	 My problem is more elemental: For a comedy, "White Suit" is not funny.
0.79 	 Like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film, it's leaned on too long.<br /><br />I've never seen Guinness less affecting in a movie, even though he looks impossibly young and earnest (though actually in his mid-30s).
0.98 	 He seems so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general he played in "Doctor Zhivago" He's the same cold fish whether he's ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job (pan-faced Vida Hope as Bertha) or the more sultry charms of young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his one real ally in his fight against "shabbiness and dirt", as she puts it, making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only Greenwood could.<br /><br />Supporting players make "White Suit" work as well as it does.
0.78 	 Ernest Thesinger of "Bride Of Frankenstein" fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle.
0.99 	 Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in "Lawrence Of Arabia".
0.58 	 Then there's the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else.<br /><br />But most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn't think director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before (his previous Ealing comedy "Whisky Galore" doesn't reverse that impression, alas).
1.0 	 Yet the Ealings I've seen never seem to do this, working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies.
1.0 	 "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, go figure) are classics this way.
0.82 	 There a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about Innocent People being killed in WTC massacre.
0.83 	 And the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives.
0.9 	 Definitely worth every penny you spend.
0.76 	 But please don't expect anything more apart from Films in this DVD.
0.93 	 There is of course Filmographies of the Film Makers but No Extra Features.
0.92 	 Any person who finds it cynical I have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the film's entire message.
0.96 	 A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine!
0.9 	 This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny.
0.72 	 Even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do...WHY?
0.8 	 There are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all movies have these.
0.8 	 Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing, and the British.
0.98 	 Forever more, "Do you have a flag?"
0.87 	 A young couple moves into a house, where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived.
0.92 	 The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback, will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only).
0.97 	 A bunch of National Guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants.
0.74 	 One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off.
0.99 	 There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is precious little else to get excited about.
0.94 	 Much of the action takes place in caves, ala "The Descent", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy.
0.58 	 Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant.
0.94 	 We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one.
0.88 	 I can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it.
0.94 	 So I know that's why it didn't have a higher rating.
1.0 	 Heck, even King himself didn't fare so bad.
0.99 	 The first shot of Jack's typewriter, accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball, like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself, later on proving to be nothing short of just that.
0.99 	 A red river flowing through the hotel's elevators in slow motion.
1.0 	 And of course, the bathroom scene.<br /><br />Much has been said of Jack Nicholson's obtrusive overacting.
0.98 	 The guy looks half-mad anyway.
0.96 	 Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself.

0.99 	 I find it mildly torturous and cruel but I'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of America!!

1.0 	 There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short.<br /><br />"The Grinch" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion).
0.95 	 I used to like him very much in his "Waynes World" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and "the Cat In The Hat" has just finished me off.

0.95 	 And, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering.
0.92 	 I'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even Franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched "Succubus", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it!
0.98 	 Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.
0.93 	 Another good selection would be Caddyshack, the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines like greens keeper Carl Spackler's "Correct me if I'm wrong Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key."
0.93 	 Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good.

0.71 	 It's 1978, and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well!
0.72 	 Fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy there are so many black players on the field!

0.54 	 The tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad.<br /><br />The ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here.
0.94 	 This is what I call a growth movie.

0.88 	 I haven't seen BSG, I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it.
0.99 	 ABC's fault.
0.62 	 It was first up against Police Woman on NBC.
0.69 	 ABC had huge problems with Friday nights.
0.78 	 Kolchak should have been a hit.
0.98 	 Too bad the writing wasn't up to Richard Matheson's in the original TV movies.
0.98 	 That INS set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today, yet that was part of the appeal.

0.96 	 Well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an 'actor' as he is a singer and writer.
0.95 	 With 'Auf Wiedersehen Pet' the opposite applies.
0.75 	 It's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family.
0.53 	 Why would you want to watch this?
0.61 	 But nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions.
0.88 	 I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further.
0.85 	 Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex-jailbird.
0.98 	 She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her.
0.92 	 Then there's Delmar's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father.
0.96 	 On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film.
0.74 	 So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction.
0.84 	 <br /><br />If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed.
0.9 	 Has Delmar and Jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development?
0.99 	 Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room?
0.51 	 Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar, Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material.

0.86 	 Shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an infuriating know-it-all that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she came into view.
0.79 	 Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and say it veeeeeeeery often.<br /><br />I'm otherwise a big fan of animÃ© and manga, and never before have I disliked one so much.
0.7 	 I read that the series creator/writer wrote this while suffering from a depression, and I can believe that; it made me depressed to watch it.
0.64 	 Is that the aim of this series?
0.66 	 And if suffering from a depression, why just not write a book or biography about it, instead of mixing it up with aliens and mecha's?
1.0 	 Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me.
0.58 	 Where was this film when I was a kid?
0.97 	 The kids always are picking on the poor kid.
0.58 	 Watching it I felt I was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book.
1.0 	 Things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication, one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep.
0.89 	 My first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that I couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world, then I realized who was making the movie.
1.0 	 The mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk.
0.92 	 You also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do.
0.99 	 Frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen.

0.68 	 I unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to watch it; though not expecting much.
0.73 	 As the beginning credits roll around I'm surprised to discover this film was made under the Filmirage company.
0.94 	 Like the movie's pace, these scene transitions got progressively worse.<br /><br />I could try to say the character development of Dr. Houseman was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once you've seen what the Doctor has metamorphosed into, hopefully you'll laugh-- which really, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; this movie unintentionally runs like a long-winded joke.<br /><br />The costume of the um, thing that Doctor Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D' Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword", which was made in the same year.
0.96 	 You've gotta love Filmirage movies, they're always re-using the same stuff!
0.94 	 True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it.
0.77 	 You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents.

1.0 	 These people simply cannot act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to a ridiculous degree).<br /><br />Still, I gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners.
0.98 	 Also, I'd like to see more attempts like this one.
0.99 	 Debbie Reynolds toe-taps, tangos and, yes, tap-dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly fabricated '30s atmosphere.

0.87 	 Can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford...?

0.99 	 Hell, I even enjoy the lesbians.
0.81 	 The Vampire was really Nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient?
0.89 	 Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies?
1.0 	 In Joel Schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time.
0.62 	 But this is common knowledge; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur.
0.98 	 Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy.
0.9 	 Batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me.
0.82 	 I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D-Day landings during Saving Private Ryan: at the time when I first saw the film, I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished.
0.99 	 My eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'I can't believe it smile' on my face.

0.7 	 This is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge.
0.76 	 What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name.
0.78 	 While lacking in innovation, Tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look.
0.71 	 This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site, and that is a significant statement from someone who likes "The Attack of the Monolith Monsters."
0.96 	 I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages.
0.99 	 This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged, or stimulated in any way.
0.61 	 Don't be surprise ,however, if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game.
1.0 	 As an adult who enjoys being entertained, who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy, and action, all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and/or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to offer.
0.8 	 Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g.
0.65 	 Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if one is familiar with the storyline, he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand).

0.99 	 This list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie.

1.0 	 For such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best.
0.67 	 Laughs guaranteed!<br /><br />The bizarre thing is, van Rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement.
0.86 	 To be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the DVD's commentary track.
0.52 	 Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as of today.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction Oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and I wonder why?
0.92 	 Was it given the Oscars because the director being ex of James Cameron, and made it a nice underdog (gossipy) story for day time TV shows to munch on?
0.86 	 And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing for that?
0.85 	 Wait till they run it on TV in a few years.
0.6 	 Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium.
0.7 	 However the actual screenplay was the work of Joel Sayre and Fred Guiol, both of whom, Guiol especially, had a background in comedy.
0.79 	 We see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light-hearted brawl.
0.98 	 Towards the middle of Gunga Din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot.
0.94 	 However the continual forays into comedy Â such as the spiked punch routine Â make this "slow" portion bearable.<br /><br />Producer-director George Stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the Hal Roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point.
0.86 	 The portrayal of the abandoned village and the Thuggee cultists cry of "Kali!"
0.96 	 Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions, but he is by no means bad.
0.98 	 He made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s-1960s that he sold with gimmicks.
0.69 	 "The Tingler" had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre.
1.0 	 The movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them.
1.0 	 It's very short (under 90 minutes) and there's never a dull moment.
0.6 	 <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough.
0.67 	 Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be, whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point.
0.61 	 As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief, although the less charitable may not do.
1.0 	 I wanted to like this over-the-top, anti-film aspirant, and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance.
0.63 	 Sadly, those moments are few and far between.
0.77 	 In particular the "straight" couple Linda and Young Guy.
0.89 	 In particular the story centering on Bob and Tim.
1.0 	 These are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Zelinas (Tim).
0.99 	 Tim is a boxer with some serious issues.
0.52 	 Remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating.
1.0 	 When the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted, the resulting in the film's only genuine emotional catharsis.
0.95 	 Alas, there really isn't much to recommend this yet, the performances by Messrs. King and Zelinas, really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing.
0.58 	 <br /><br />And what's the story line?
0.99 	 <br /><br />Instead of "Let's put on a show, gang" we have "We need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing."
0.99 	 Exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes (which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour; you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts out, giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of "By a Waterfall" that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy.
0.99 	 This number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with waterslides, a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a Depression on.
0.7 	 The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting.
0.88 	 There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles tossed and caught.
0.99 	 Its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode.<br /><br />But don't worry!
0.98 	 <br /><br />Only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks.
0.71 	 gonna re watch it till i get this.<br /><br />anyways this episode really touched me, and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience.<br /><br />10/10 no doubt.
0.58 	 I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney picture: the birth of Spirit.
0.99 	 Don't get me wrong.
0.95 	 Look at all the positive reviews.
0.51 	 Crimminy!
0.96 	 and wait till you to the "rosebud" [sic] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for.
0.88 	 No jobs for you!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE!
0.93 	 <br /><br />To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film.
0.96 	 Even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent.
0.94 	 And a big loss if you haven't seen it (yet)...
0.8 	 However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.
0.72 	 Ok, I first saw this movie like at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning, boy was I 180d on that.
0.88 	 I mean, the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie.
0.98 	 The plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women.
0.51 	 3/10.
0.87 	 What happened to the Gaylord fortune?
0.99 	 If the will is worth half a billion, why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters?
0.82 	 And why is he able to take someone's home away from them?
0.71 	 We instead just follow Fiona's life from one train wreck to another, the evil Barclay takes away her home, her fortune, and even her child.
0.54 	 Shoot him?
0.7 	 Set him on fire?
0.92 	 And they're going to live happily ever after.
0.99 	 Yeah, sure, steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I'll fall in love with you.
0.95 	 I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today.
0.79 	 the only bit that was worth it was the ending (those who have seen the film will know what i mean).
0.69 	 Although this film did demand a soid attention span at times.
1.0 	 I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies.
0.6 	 A lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies.
0.87 	 When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality.
1.0 	 It's done by highly skilled craftsmen.
1.0 	 That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours.
0.55 	 But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really find anything.
0.59 	 The dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple.
0.82 	 But, when the threatening phone calls begin again, Winters responds by flipping out--behaving like she's nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion--listening on the radio to 'Sister Alma' almost constantly.
0.91 	 Again and again, you see Winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things!!
1.0 	 added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs.
0.91 	 <br /><br />The filmmaker adds 2 main character's, a woman and her therapist.
0.67 	 The woman has been having dreams about the Boogeyman and his victim's from the first film.
0.98 	 These scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow.
0.97 	 They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old.
0.97 	 A sad, sad sight indeed is The Munster's Revenge.
0.93 	 The Munsters are brought back one last time(Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of Herman Munster)in this made-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman that are robots "terrorizing" the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy's stash at an exhibit.
1.0 	 Or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super K-Mart fashion makeover.
1.0 	 K. C. Martell makes an ever-so-not affable Eddie Munster.
1.0 	 Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn.
0.79 	 Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner.
0.9 	 The film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made-for-TV movie.
0.87 	 Firstly, top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part!
1.0 	 He's not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary!
1.0 	 The staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip.
0.68 	 Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation.
0.84 	 Under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the Bannister.
0.98 	 Some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered.
0.62 	 <br /><br />Out of the Krimi films I've seen, THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory.
0.94 	 I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit(..which isn't used), the fake bible/water pistol, when opened, fires the gas into the face of startled victims, the Greaves' Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat, and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming.
0.95 	 Higgins, using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator, instead follows the clues/facts, often avoiding Sir John as much as possible.
0.65 	 Macedonia.
0.72 	 Bosnia and Herzegowina.
1.0 	 Carlitos Way(1993) is a great film.
0.95 	 This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe speed Zone.
0.99 	 Remember those gems!
0.96 	 I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder.
0.58 	 One of the features on the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel" but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie.<br /><br />One of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the DVD.
0.74 	 He said, with a straight face, that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast - and that he had succeeded.
0.88 	 When Marty does it to his victims, they become turned onto him/her.
0.97 	 However, when Andrew seduces Scully, she only because disoriented and groggy, and does not become attracted to Andrew.
0.88 	 This episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in British Columbia.
0.81 	 Throughout the episode it is so wet, soggy, and muddy, it could not have been that much fun.
0.71 	 The Dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it's psycho.
0.99 	 We had mad police officers, ambulance men, secretery's and that was just for starters.
0.91 	 The Dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman's nightmare.<br /><br />The plot is twisted.
0.54 	 Dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty IRS guy (Terminator's Earl Boen), dirty pool cleaner "cleaning" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter.
0.99 	 He goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way.
0.98 	 Linda Hoffman was beutiful and dumb as Feinstones wife.
0.99 	 Virginya Keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to Feinstone.<br /><br />Final warning: If you're like me and have problem with dentist's then maybe you should skip this one.
1.0 	 SPOILERS: I'm always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews.
0.9 	 You almost pray for their deaths.
0.76 	 If you're expecting some kind of Anne Rice style vampire story, forget it.
0.64 	 This game's story has very little to do with vampires.
0.86 	 I'm amazed it got off the drawing board.
0.67 	 Mostly, the story centers around a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure.
0.58 	 The kidnapping of a royal baby, which should have been the focus, really gets pushed aside.
0.99 	 The characters move about at a snail's pace even on the best of systems.
0.99 	 And it's not fun.
1.0 	 Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he doesn't think she's the one for him.
0.52 	 And he seems really grossed out that they slept together.
0.72 	 Instead, the story focused on the author's warped vision of Christianity.
1.0 	 Here they had the elements for a great adventure, and instead we got this.<br /><br />For me, the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end.
0.94 	 We do get a few action style puzzles at the end.
0.51 	 I only recently dusted it off to see what I'd been missing.
0.82 	 My favorite characters were ruined.
0.59 	 I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series.
0.54 	 And I hope they get it right next time.
0.83 	 My reason for renting this was simple: Find a movie with scriptwriting.
0.8 	 So.....I took this back and picked up Ed Wood.
0.55 	 This was especially "odd" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years.
0.82 	 Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an "odd" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that!
0.65 	 The wrinkles on his face tell many a story.
1.0 	 It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this.
0.88 	 My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan.
1.0 	 I like him too, but have generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedic roles.
0.99 	 I realize it was inspired by a true story.
0.93 	 None of the characters were well developed.
0.98 	 There was a side story about the main character and his partner.
0.92 	 This relationship could have been explored further.
0.58 	 More important, though, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy".
0.93 	 Her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into.
0.93 	 They're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession.
0.7 	 A 7 out of 10.
1.0 	 In my book "Basic Instinct" was a perfect film.
0.98 	 It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role.
1.0 	 It had marvelous photography, music and the noirest noir script ever.
0.57 	 The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re-enacted copy of the original.
0.97 	 The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original.
0.91 	 There should be a law: Don't ever make a sequel to a perfect film!
0.98 	 Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film.
1.0 	 Clearly by the "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring.
1.0 	 If this movie doesn't touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead.
0.92 	 Hey now, yours truly, TheatreX, found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market, in almost new condition, and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a "cult hit" so of course it came home with me.
0.93 	 <br /><br />What a strange film.
0.88 	 and who knows what else.
0.59 	 Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right.
1.0 	 done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that.
0.9 	 These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, except to them.
0.99 	 They live in absolute filth, cats doing their business wherever ("Look, that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!
0.5 	 "), and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations.
0.88 	 One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested.
0.81 	 The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for "wacked out of their gourds", but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them.
0.97 	 This is equal parts creepy, sad, and disgusting, but I couldn't stop watching once I started.
0.82 	 It won't be for everybody though, guaranteed.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
1.0 	 THAT'S certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested.
0.85 	 And it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio, given that (1) The feuds between the cast were well known long before the movie's release.
0.96 	 (2) The feud between the Producer(Robert Fryer) and Director ( Michael Sarne) was also common knowledge.
0.93 	 Raquel Welch does <br /><br />give a decent performance as Myra, and she looks lovely besides.
0.85 	 John Huston is very funny as Buck Loner, the ex-Cowboy Star who runs a phony acting academy.
1.0 	 Mae West, (in her first screen appearance since 1943) naturally rewrote her part to suit herself, and she is great as ''oversexed'' (and that's putting it mildly) ''Talent Agent'' Leticia Van Allen.
0.99 	 Still, she must have wondered (after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return) how she ever ended up in this mess.<br /><br />Tom Selleck (in his film debut) is one of her ''clients''.
0.98 	 Rex Reed as Myron, Farrah Fawcett and Roger Herren, as the victims of Myra/Myron's sexual passion, are neither here nor there.
0.78 	 Not surprisingly, just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way, and it died at the box office.
0.99 	 A technically flawless DVD includes, (among other extras) separate commentaries from both Welch and Sarne, each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrong.No doubt it's home video re-release was prompted by a 2001'' Vanity Fair'' piece, which attempted (in great detail) to do the same thing.
0.73 	 In my opinion, the Norris Brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production!
0.62 	 I hope you take the time to view this movie!
0.91 	 This movie is not your typical horror movie.
0.62 	 Even for the lamest of movies I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, it's humor, even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible.
0.52 	 Looking at it within it's own genera or subgenera.
0.97 	 The visuals are all sitcom style.
0.84 	 The acting is as cardboard as it comes, all around and that goes for Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" that got this train wreck green-lighted) too.
0.73 	 Twisted, shallow women are common.
0.7 	 Male-bashing is the norm.
1.0 	 The characters all broadly drawn so they will SEEM relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator.
1.0 	 Just look at "the marquee scene", "cult classic" hair gel scene.
0.85 	 For some reason light shines down on it as if he's found the holy grail.
0.86 	 Oh, my sides.
0.93 	 Of course, people also like "Friends" and reality dating shows so I shouldn't be surprised.
0.84 	 "Whipped" is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex.
0.66 	 <br /><br />
0.51 	 London Dreams is no exception to that.
0.99 	 It's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it.
0.99 	 Sounds impressive right?
0.71 	 But unfortunately the film is not.<br /><br />Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday.
0.85 	 His dream is to perform in Wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name.
1.0 	 He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a ravishing Priya (Asin).
1.0 	 Together they form "London Dreams" their dream band.
0.99 	 After impressing the chief of a record company, they become overnight sensations.
0.99 	 Arjun is secretly in love with Priya which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal.
1.0 	 Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life, to join their band.
1.0 	 Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later Arjun become envious for Mannu's superior skills and his affair with Priya.
1.0 	 What happens next forms the rest of the movies.<br /><br />Coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha whom we have admired in Namaste London.
0.96 	 Screenplay by Suresh Nair dulls even though it has its moments.
1.0 	 Camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of London.
1.0 	 It's the only entertaining part while watching songs.<br /><br />Few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare.
0.78 	 Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character.
1.0 	 Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strictly OK. Brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies.
0.85 	 Ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings.
0.85 	 Billed as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - it is certainly Horrific.
0.54 	 There is nothing Thrilling about it.
0.99 	 STEER CLEAR.
0.96 	 Well last summer, I watched them both together and decided I was wrong.
0.77 	 The first one is a better Care Bears movie (as you may have guessed if you read my review for it).
1.0 	 This one isn't a BAD movie, it's just...
0.68 	 VERY STRANGE.<br /><br />Well first of all, as a few people have mentioned, it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie.
0.67 	 I can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met).
0.97 	 When I was little and watching this, I was quite a bit confused and distraught.
0.98 	 It's like that bizzare "Santa Clause vs. Satan" movie from Mexico you hear about sometimes.
0.83 	 <br /><br />Anyhow, the demon's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the Care Bears in return for him giving her special powers.
1.0 	 Very dark for a kiddy flick eh?
0.52 	 And did I mention that Darkheart appears to the girl most often as a WHINEY VOICED 10 YEAR OLD BOY???
0.6 	 Oh, man!
0.72 	 !<br /><br />Needless to say, everything gets cleared up in the end (but not before we get to see Darkheart trap the Care Bears' souls in this scary chandelere thing in one [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene).
0.66 	 While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is crap when spoken.
0.57 	 Most of the plots from the book have gotten lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?"
0.83 	 I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.
0.88 	 You won't have to think too hard to recognize that person.
0.77 	 Much of this movie was filmed in Bulgaria, which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment.
0.75 	 (You just know that the US military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war-profiteering.)
0.98 	 If you believe, however, that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation's bottom line is an abomination I think you'll find much to appreciate in this film.
1.0 	 Nothing could be more in keeping with the Spirit of Independence that heaping well-deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be.
0.97 	 If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.
0.63 	 Hey,<br /><br />If your going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try making it about Leonard Cohen!
0.87 	 This is filled with only enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them questionable) talk about themselves.
0.99 	 Puleeze....sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you, what about Leonard?
0.88 	 Guess what people, if you "do something" worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you.
0.63 	 Leonard doesn't need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality.
1.0 	 What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film.
0.77 	 I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen tunes - the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable.<br /><br />Cohen fans, don't say I didn't warn you!
0.69 	 There was a FEW funny parts.
0.71 	 They deserved better.
0.69 	 Overall, this movie is NOT Home Alone, it's NOT A Christmas Story, its NOT Christmas Vacation or any of the other classics.
1.0 	 When the young Kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift, he invites five friends of him to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend.
1.0 	 While in the journey, they drink booze, have sex and play games, with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear.
1.0 	 Later Kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear.<br /><br />Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD.
0.89 	 Was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends?
1.0 	 If that is true, are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness?
0.99 	 My vote is one.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Trip to the Death")
0.81 	 Of course they are the new Universal-Soldiers.
0.55 	 It turns out that Van Damme works for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (Who has seen the first movie may think that this is the most unlogical thing, that yould Van Dammes character could do).
0.8 	 But it is a sequel.
0.97 	 And a "story" has to come up.
0.94 	 He has a daughter.
1.0 	 Van Damme escapes from the facility BUT the computer sends some soldiers hunting him (It wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)).
0.78 	 It comes to a final show down where Van Damme fights the Bad Guy and you can see the most expensive scene of the whole movie (please see for yourself.
0.82 	 But if you do, keep a sixpack with you!
0.86 	 I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks.
0.63 	 This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation.
0.97 	 I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move.
0.85 	 He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls.
0.67 	 I've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages!
0.99 	 This film may not appeal to some people (I can't really say why without spoiling it!)
0.6 	 It looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it!<br /><br />Although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch.
1.0 	 I was sorry to see it cut off..
0.99 	 The plot is fairly thin.
0.92 	 or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold-rope chain.<br /><br />Blondie's "Rapture" is def poetry next to this bit of Dr. Suess in the hood.
0.99 	 A couple actually get killed being heroic - notable in that none of them fill the role of sidekick.
0.97 	 You know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village for ****ing with the tourist trade after the credits roll...<br /><br />The Pros: Barbara Bach.
0.97 	 Barbara Bach.
0.97 	 Barbara Bach.
0.97 	 Barbara Bach.
0.94 	 You ALL know WHY you're interested in this film in the first place, right?
0.52 	 THIS SHOULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!!
0.66 	 If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie, please contact me.
1.0 	 it is of course very nice to see improvements on Turkish movie industry, however, i would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar.
0.94 	 and that scene was so suitable for "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" title!!
0.53 	 there were also a lot of preciosities in the film.
0.97 	 the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it.
0.91 	 i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview.
0.95 	 !hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry!
1.0 	 This was recommended to me by friend as a "unique film experience."
0.55 	 He was right.
0.89 	 Try to borrow it, if you must see it.
0.99 	 Friz Freleng's 'Speedy Gonzalez' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimson's 'Cat-tails for Two'.
0.98 	 Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character.
0.75 	 In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat.
0.83 	 Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat.
0.69 	 undemanding role of pursuer.
0.78 	 Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born.
0.65 	 Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves.
0.8 	 Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim.
0.98 	 Santa's Tentacles reach far and wide!
0.99 	 <br /><br />Satan's dance routine is hilarious.
1.0 	 Pitch...he is so useless.<br /><br />The cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous.
0.99 	 Very low budget but so fun to watch.
0.73 	 "Loonatics Unleashed " is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones .
0.91 	 Zero stars
0.93 	 programme producer Zack Zardine (Matt Borlenghi) his camerawoman, the Australian Cecily (Kate Fisher) and two surfer 'dudes' named Bog Hall (Dax Miller) and Jeremy (Joel West) arrive on some nice looking island somewhere, it's not actually revealed where.
0.51 	 The crew plan to shoot an expose on 'bloodsurfing' which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports.
0.99 	 Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco (Cris Vertido) and his wife Melba (Susan Africa).
0.9 	 Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo-Cay.
0.97 	 Sonny, Melba and their daughter Lemmya (Maureen Larrazabal) take them in their boat.
0.89 	 Pirates?
0.51 	 Revolutionairies?
0.85 	 Who knows?
0.96 	 And more importantly who cares?
0.96 	 Anyway, after escaping from these guys who look like pirates, they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks (Duncan Regehr) and his girl Arty (Taryn Reif as Tara Reif).
0.99 	 Captain Dirks heads back to Lilo-Cay for a final showdown with the giant man-eating crocodile.<br /><br />Directed by James D.R.
0.76 	 Bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later of TV's "Flamingo Road") as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the Gateway to Hell!
0.8 	 The movie is nearly a cross-pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist"--but what a combination!
0.73 	 ***1/2 from ****
0.68 	 till HBO began rerunning it this month.
0.97 	 There's just no question.
0.95 	 (which I really like, BTW).
0.68 	 The last symptoms of brain fever!
0.97 	 She could blow at any moment!"
0.98 	 I started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then I realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be, there isn't one thing I'd change or improve upon.
0.51 	 I have to get this on DVD, that's just all there is to it.
0.9 	 You'd be forgiven to think a Finnish director from Helsinki would be no good at directing an American horror movie (especially one entirely located inside a US prison) - see this to prove yourself wrong!
0.85 	 Do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror puff, IMO it's definitely worth it!
0.64 	 With no real stand out roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier.
0.61 	 The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself, and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this, doesn't love himself.
1.0 	 The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, thankfully, had no sequel) are great, funny films.
1.0 	 You'll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate.
0.93 	 And mind you, this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on.
0.79 	 And least I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in "Boogie Nights", another film that, like "Deliverance" years earlier, shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.
0.89 	 Though American-made, it is set entirely in England.
0.57 	 It lacks a femme fatale.
0.98 	 It does not lack crime.<br /><br />The title character answers an ad.
0.96 	 Instead, she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot.
0.99 	 She is no screaming, cowering victim.
0.89 	 She is actually a bit icy and patrician, albeit impecunious.
0.92 	 She has a sweet manner and a harmless, slightly dithering manner.
0.98 	 Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing.
0.97 	 But he did it on a low budget.
0.72 	 I can't believe that people actually liked this movie.
0.68 	 The role of Nicholas Cage wasn't very convincing.
0.88 	 The whole movie felt like a grand tour around America's most wanted buildings.
1.0 	 I guess I've just seen too many movies to enjoy National Treasure.
0.86 	 When I first picked this film up I was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen.
1.0 	 I'm a fan of animation and love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage.
1.0 	 However, the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed.
1.0 	 Although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent.
1.0 	 The visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece.
0.7 	 Not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all.
1.0 	 Normally I enjoy Robin Williams movies, however this gem was not one of them.
1.0 	 It was billed as a suspenseful thriller.
0.93 	 The movie is about A storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid.
0.6 	 However *insert spooky here* no one can verify the kids existence.
1.0 	 It had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit.
0.87 	 I've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict, British school in the 1960's to understand this.
0.9 	 It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have, and it makes no sense.<br /><br />The characters who go on a murder spree aren't fighting the institution, they're just killing people.
0.97 	 The real show stopper is at the crap game at the end.
0.67 	 Her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.<br /><br />Now for the bad parts--Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck with a drab colorless role and can't do much with it.
0.98 	 The movie is far too long at 150 minutes--the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag and should have been shortened.
0.52 	 I give it a 7.
0.85 	 I got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with 'Zombie Bloodbath' as one of it's alternative titles.
0.56 	 I truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.<br /><br />So apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However, if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo, you'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick.
0.84 	 The story is C-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered B-movie caliber.
0.87 	 Great films are born of substance, not budget.
1.0 	 Don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining.
0.51 	 Slither is one.
0.98 	 The best thing about this "film" is the DVD cover, so next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin, take a look at it-- DON'T TOUCH IT, just look-- and quietly walk away.
0.97 	 I went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of "spiritual" New Age types, who, quite unlike me, very much enjoyed this movie---although according to those that also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the movie is not quite as good.
0.83 	 I do not walk out on movies, not even on this one, but I should've when I first saw the visual depiction of an aura, because the New Age BS keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.<br /><br />The plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies, in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution.
0.63 	 Occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as "another dimension", or perhaps "another plane", only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment.
0.74 	 Some very pretty nature shots, and some decent supporting performances by Elizondo and de Almeida.<br /><br />I honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable.
0.97 	 To make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director.
0.8 	 He mustn't have done much in his career.
0.65 	 I like very much Donald Sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie.
1.0 	 Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes.
1.0 	 I would say for instance that Sutherland was excellent in JFK of Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non-stop without even taking a breath.
0.99 	 Wonderful.
0.98 	 She is probably good for TV series.
0.92 	 Terrible colors.
0.54 	 When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie.
0.96 	 I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life.
0.93 	 From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot.
0.98 	 But a new tyrant of a principal, Ms. Togar thinks rock 'n' roll is a bad influence on the students, especially the music from The Ramones.
0.69 	 But when Ms. Togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets.
0.75 	 Yep, that's right 'Rock n Roll high School' doesn't drift away from it main focus
 a boisterously, daggy romp!
0.72 	 It wasn't what I was expecting, that's for sure.
1.0 	 That's not to say I think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be.
0.86 	 But watching this passionately, crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks, I just couldn't wipe the grin off my face.
0.99 	 It's tacky, very cheesy, densely chaotic, but damn it's funky-dory!
0.63 	 <br /><br />This low-budget, b-grade feature from producer Roger Corman and John Dante who was co-writer ( and plus he co-directed some scenes when director Allan Arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot).
0.88 	 And they manage to do that.
0.98 	 These are musicians not actors, which means it's not about their acting here, it's the music we're suppose to dig.
0.51 	 They're here to perform!
0.8 	 Norman, Is That You?
0.98 	 For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting- if not a little "hollywood".
0.87 	 Don't believe me?
0.94 	 Check out lines about curtains, etc.
0.97 	 And, it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version, I'm told.
0.98 	 You can't find any flaws in the dialogues.
0.65 	 Please watch this movie.
0.96 	 what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica Simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head.
0.73 	 The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious.
0.99 	 I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Day.
0.77 	 Supposedly based on fact, you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the Indian army had in recapturing the area from the Pakistani troops - who occupied the high ground.
0.75 	 It was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time, and music would abruptly end at scene changes.<br /><br />Good things: The cinematography was pretty good, although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour corrected (the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes).
0.93 	 Also, the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable - for the first half a dozen or so verses at least.
0.7 	 Then he's approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go.
0.66 	 Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him.<br /><br />This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time (I don't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere.)
0.66 	 It doesn't rank among his worst, but it doesn't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all, really), either.<br /><br />This is, at best, mildly suspenseful, with a minimal of action, naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role.
0.97 	 Likewise, in a main supporting role, it's quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs.<br /><br />It says a lot that by the end the only 'contract' that's keeping you interested is when Snipes's will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films.
0.99 	 On the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow.
0.9 	 A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along.
1.0 	 Rather than helping, at least one of the hunters, Otis (John Speredakos), is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers.
0.96 	 George, Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis, and even worse, we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they're staying.
0.83 	 Are there wendigos in the woods?
0.97 	 Much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature.
0.85 	 And perhaps the fatal blow for many people, it has a very ambiguous ending, with a number of questions left unanswered.
0.86 	 If you are discouraged by such endings, and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant, do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo.<br /><br />Personally, I like films like that.
0.57 	 I usually prefer some ambiguity.
0.95 	 For him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse.
0.97 	 She's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her, hoping that they'll go away and get better.
0.53 	 The "Wendigo" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous.
0.93 	 The lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been, but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock (it could have been digital instead) or transfer.
0.96 	 I picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was, but when I watched it I laughed so hard.
0.57 	 Ditto Prochnow.
0.63 	 "<br /><br />Going back to sleep now.
1.0 	 Definitely not one of Johns best movies.
0.54 	 Don't get me wrong, with any John Wayne move there is always some good spots.
0.96 	 And this one has it's fair share.
0.99 	 Bruce Dern again does an outstanding job as the villain.
0.96 	 Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie.
0.9 	 This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers.<br /><br />This would be a good family move to watch with your children.
0.92 	 Just be aware, there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it.
0.8 	 Maybe it's because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work.
0.84 	 Stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy, depressed, filthy Erie, Pennsylvania.
0.93 	 (Note that I saw the censored version and not the uncut - this part of the film was redone for the censors.)
0.82 	 Then she asks Chico for another case, and that's filled with more jewelry, plus securities.
0.98 	 As a bizarre byproduct of the code, blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place.<br /><br />Precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore, though they're 70+ years old, seem more modern.
0.64 	 The one I saw had an added scene, but apparently, there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors.
0.84 	 (There wasn't a code but there were always censors.)
0.68 	 One of the kids wants to know the work of his father (a terrible mistake), so he hides on his father's car and well, he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way.<br /><br />Mafia doesn't rules, in Mafia nobody wins, when they want you out, they take you out.
0.68 	 Hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia, and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers.<br /><br />This movie receives: 10/10
0.68 	 I have seen it.
1.0 	 It's not "good" but interesting in an understated way.
0.71 	 However, the film has a look which can draw you in.
0.68 	 If a feeling can be vacuous-this is it.
0.98 	 The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals.
0.73 	 I felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since I had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but I came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money I had paid for it.
0.92 	 This film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects.
0.62 	 Consider yourself warned.
0.94 	 Peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing.
1.0 	 This movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release Mr. Baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood.
1.0 	 Thank god for "Team America" for putting him in his place.<br /><br />3/10
1.0 	 In spite of the great future-design touches, the clever Asimov premise, and Will Smith's dependable cool performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations.
0.97 	 I love the frequently misnomered "Masters of Horror" series.
1.0 	 Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" with gave us "Feast" - like it or lump it) are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror.<br /><br />This one began with a kernel of really-kool-idea and ran ... right off the edge of "where in the world am I going with this?!!!
0.51 	 ...
0.54 	 Not the other way around.
0.96 	 "Kooky drama"?
0.97 	 "Lawyers in Loony Tunes Land"?
0.59 	 It has POLITICAL CORRECTNESS written with huge, neon letters.
0.8 	 Is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of LAWYERS being full of ideals, high principles, and moral fiber?
0.84 	 Laughable, but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in Hollywood since its inception.
0.52 	 When a TV series as retarded as "Ally McBeak" starts preaching to America about how it should run the country, then it must be time for Paris Hilton to become President.
0.87 	 "Ally McBeak" is a highly commercialized TV venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies, bored housewives, and bipolar lawyers.
0.89 	 Don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews.
1.0 	 I never thought that his show was all that great.
0.92 	 Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes.
0.66 	 Everyone ends up in the pond except Chaplin.
0.84 	 The first film ever made.
0.98 	 There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.<br /><br />But consider this short again.
0.96 	 There is nothing 'objective' about it.
0.98 	 The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.<br /><br />worse is the historical reality of the film.
0.9 	 The bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions.
0.56 	 It aired on TV yesterday, so I decided to check it out.
0.68 	 Even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say, Batman Forever.
0.57 	 There are a few downsides, however, Nightwing is nowhere to be seen, and I'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne don't click as a couple, even though is just referenced, Tim Drake(aka Robin) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank, I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman character design(especially in their Batman shows post-BTAS), this The New Adventures of Batman and Robin, well, it kinda makes Batman look fat then rather a well-built bulked up individual(kinda like the Jeff Matsuda character model from The Batman).
0.81 	 Bruce Wayne seems a bit awkward, those blue eyes make him look more like Clark Kent then Bruce(though it's true they do look very much alike).
0.66 	 Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it.
0.62 	 The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb (the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?)
0.99 	 All easy to follow (unless the "experimental" one irritates your desire for a formulaic story.
0.83 	 I even laughed at a mime piece, like no other I have seen (thank you for that!)
0.95 	 Not sure when it comes out, but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work..and sometimes, what doesn't work (if it covers too much time, emotionally, for a short film.)
0.85 	 !thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes(English is my second language)...
1.0 	 If they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring.
0.99 	 Just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you.
0.99 	 Luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either.
0.85 	 Much better then the other flight movie Flight Plan.<br /><br />Here is my Flight Plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578<br /><br />I recommend.
0.95 	 Not too long and not too shabby.<br /><br />8/10
1.0 	 I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully.
0.58 	 I am also not alone in scorning Richard Lester's Superman 2... which brings us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie, sadly it is still an absolute abomination.<br /><br />Superman's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far.
0.99 	 My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in.
0.83 	 I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't known that.
0.99 	 This film has a deceptively good cast, most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts.
0.96 	 And there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian Lenore Zann.
0.82 	 But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me.
0.99 	 As a film overall, the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrendous editing.
1.0 	 And when I say horrendous, I'm not using that word lightly.
1.0 	 (That doesn't give away any plot details; if anything, one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as I was by the editing.)
0.62 	 This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead, but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark-guy.
0.96 	 Kind of like in Beauty and the Beast.
0.99 	 She gave up on love!
0.65 	 The pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis (loosely) for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle, "The Money Pit".<br /><br />If you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see.
0.55 	 I had heard good things about this film and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed.
0.71 	 The reason I didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit.
0.95 	 Perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot, or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer.
0.98 	 Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think.
0.79 	 It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the younger) would be traumatised and angry, but why is her sister shown to be more upset?
1.0 	 Hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film?
0.81 	 Since that happened, I've always wondered what the show would have been like.
0.99 	 somehow, that doesn't make sense.
0.5 	 not just traced by powder.
0.56 	 or, what about a CD for a screwdriver?
0.82 	 and finally, what i can't stress enough, is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche, guaranteed.<br /><br />furthermore, it's worth a rental or a TV viewing, but not owning.
0.5 	 7/10.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG, but maybe it should have received something a little more strong.
0.53 	 I must admit, I found it pretty decent...until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying.
0.85 	 But having all that money, he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away, while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer.
1.0 	 If I had to pick maybe three directors to have ALL their movies on a deserted island forever, and nobody elses, John Ford would certainly be one of them.
0.98 	 Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting.
0.98 	 Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well!<br /><br />The story is not original.
1.0 	 A special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story...
0.86 	 The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there "prophecy" and the humans need someone to stop them.
0.76 	 One girl together with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.<br /><br />In this movie the director tries some Hong-Kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far.
1.0 	 And to fans of the genre I recommend "Cyborg" since I think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor.
0.72 	 ", "How?
0.77 	 ", "What's going on?
0.92 	 But I don't think we thought about what they were really going though.
0.7 	 To be honest, I thought it was an accident, I was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class.
0.85 	 Not only 15 seconds later live on TV does the second plane crash into the other World Trade Center and we knew this was no accident.
0.97 	 A few minutes later, we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane headed for Chicago but was shot down.
0.79 	 So many thoughts ran through our heads and I kept on thinking "What are the firemen and policemen going to do?".
0.93 	 But it's procedure to them I thought, they'll know what to do.<br /><br />The first tower collapsed, we knew it, so many lives are now gone, the second tower crashed, things would never be the same.
0.82 	 They didn't know what to do, they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers.
0.86 	 They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows.
0.86 	 And here I was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on TV.
0.89 	 Every day after Sep. 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors, but they kept on hoping and praying.
1.0 	 She asked "Why?".
0.71 	 I didn't know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be that evil.
0.92 	 No one expected this to happen.
0.83 	 Why?
1.0 	 To make it worse, this movie is very badly cast.
1.0 	 Wow, i'm a huge Henry VIII/Tudor era fan and, well, this was .... interesting.
0.59 	 The only one I watched was the Catherine of Aragon one.
0.97 	 Also, i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the characters weren't very acurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical.
0.94 	 Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period, and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock.
0.79 	 A woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed--did she kill him, or what happened?
0.83 	 Another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by Poverty Row in the 1930's, resurrected by the magic of DVD.<br /><br />Starring stock Universal player Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein movies) as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket.
0.62 	 Oh, well.<br /><br />Atwill does a pretty good job here, faking being deaf and mute.
0.92 	 Because of that, the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an off-balanced performance, despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off-colour character.
0.58 	 Even though it's cheaply done, there's a competent technical attitude to it.
0.98 	 Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery (more so towards the latter end), and the camera-work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating.
0.98 	 The performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon.
0.99 	 Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small, but amusing cameos
 especially Landis.
0.5 	 A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field.
0.99 	 Lacking in detail, much like any child drawing the house and it's inhabitant Marc (who can't walk because Anna didn't draw him any legs) are inhabitants of this purgatory/limbo world.
0.85 	 Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what's what and in the process tries to help save the boy, but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her, but trap her and Marc there forever.<br /><br />Wow!
0.83 	 A film that is so simple that it's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget.
0.91 	 While you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but.
0.99 	 There's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into.
0.57 	 Unfortunately she's not graced the screen since.
0.97 	 Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there, but I was easily able to overlook it.
0.92 	 Although one could immediately label the film a science fiction, there is a little more to it.
0.85 	 The whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-Cold war; something that resembles the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. in their war of word's heyday and it really pulls through given the black, bleak, often CGI littered screen that I was glued to.
0.77 	 As it is, it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot, i.e., Randolph Scott romancing Rogers' sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (that's Ozzie Nelson's wife to you baby boomers).<br /><br />Astaire and Scott are two Navy men.
0.81 	 Meanwhile, Astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off.
0.97 	 Hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain Jane turned glamor girl, although she sings her two songs well, "But Where Are You?"
0.86 	 I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one.
0.88 	 Lynch is not about that.
0.93 	 At least this side of Lynch is not.
1.0 	 Serum starts as Eddie (Derek Phillips) is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an MD like his father Richard (Dennis O'Neill) & his uncle Eddie (David H. Hickey), however his joy could be short lived as Eddie is involved in an accident & is run over by a car.
0.97 	 Thank god.
0.94 	 Of course, Cinderella didn't get to go, but her stepsisters did.
0.85 	 This movie was recommended to me and I couldn't believe that this person liked it.
0.81 	 What a travesty to all filmaking, this is true of all the new "teen horror flicks" Grudge,Boogeyman,Ring,Saw series.
0.67 	 Kept my attention from start to finish.
0.99 	 <br /><br />In a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like American Beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system.
0.72 	 Please rent this film.
0.97 	 You will not be disappointed.
0.85 	 Ha, Ha!
0.84 	 Tee, hee, hee.
1.0 	 Peter Falk is great, and he is one of the reasons its worth watching.
0.97 	 Falk has some great lines, like "he'll be right back, he goin' buy to some saugages" or something like that... there are a few nice scenes, although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors.
0.58 	 This time it's showing the black side.
0.52 	 Bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending!
0.53 	 With only less than a half dozen exceptions, ALL gay films have to end in death or an "addio" finale.
1.0 	 It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's.
0.91 	 A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset!
0.94 	 If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, for here comes another 'gay' film!
0.88 	 Other than an occasional weeping widow, the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists.
0.63 	 Nothing more.
0.81 	 One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man.
0.81 	 I mean really.
0.87 	 Talk about bad taste.
0.62 	 There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles.
1.0 	 If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it failed miserably.
0.99 	 There were no consequences.
1.0 	 Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards.
0.6 	 (bafta=good luck in Romanian).
0.82 	 With a string of anti-military/anti-war movies already being destroyed at the box office, it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script.<br /><br />At first, it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack(s) all over again.
0.59 	 I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it.
0.99 	 He'd show up, party with his friends on film, and take home a big paycheck.
0.96 	 There are shrieking ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought at least they didn't use zombies, but they came), and Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on, getting in their way.
0.98 	 Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it out to the viewer, or their confused friends.
0.96 	 So all this characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types) end up doing is running around them dark floors, and from or mistakenly to the demons.
0.62 	 In fact i haven't seen it on the TV either since the day i watched it.
0.9 	 Someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life, which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has.
0.8 	 Anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane.
1.0 	 Since the ratings on IMDb are relatively high (and they must also have been relatively high on Netflix), I guess I put it in my queue because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK, a category that has produced many films I liked immensely.
1.0 	 Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress, and I have liked her in other movies.
1.0 	 Be forewarned, oh gentle reader, not all offbeat British comedies succeed.
0.73 	 Violence whether real or not always has an impact.
1.0 	 In the Great Ecstacy the director has successfully demonstrated what extremes of violence people are capable of.
1.0 	 The violence looks like a mix of NoÃ«'s 'Irreversible, and ' Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange'...both of which are remarkable films.
0.54 	 Danny Dyer plays the character who is partly responsible for Robert's drug fuelled demise, however he is on screen for less than 5 minutes.
0.86 	 The real Ciano possibly was all that but then, why make a movie about him?
0.5 	 Mussolini was a bit more convincing, and his long way down was as if closer to the truth.
1.0 	 Watch it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap opera.
0.51 	 ).
0.53 	 once and for all.
0.77 	 I have greatly enjoyed the ones I've seen up until this one, but I just couldn't stand this one.
0.59 	 <br /><br />1.
0.66 	 There is a character named 'Rambha' in the film.
0.99 	 The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease.
0.89 	 I kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!!
0.74 	 <br /><br />Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me I can see why it's on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list.
0.51 	 !
0.86 	 Thanks for reading.
0.53 	 If you cannot enjoy a chick flick, stop right now.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.69 	 I cannot recommend Evening too much.
1.0 	 But after loads of amazing promos, Tashan finally ended as heart attack.<br /><br />Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein..... and what u get in the movie?
1.0 	 that song is such nice, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album!!!
0.93 	 Wonder why it was so popular in the 70s.
0.68 	 The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I would like it.
0.83 	 Based partially on that argument, I agreed to watch the film.<br /><br />'Flushed Away' has good intentions (At least on Aardman's part), but lacks the strength to pull it all together.
0.85 	 Its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain, Rita (Played by Kate Winselt), who, IMO, should have been the movie's main character instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman).
0.88 	 Rita's cool, tough, and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.<br /><br />One of the things that bothered me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with.
0.98 	 Try harder next time, guys.
0.71 	 After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS I am still convinced that the first decent movie about (teenage) witches yet has to be made.
0.7 	 The only film I more or less enjoyed (about teenage witches) was LITTLE WITCHES (1996), and even that one wasn't very good.
0.86 	 But changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies, you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.<br /><br />I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80's movie about teenage witches in high school.
0.93 	 And the musical score, at first, I thought was pretty good.
0.95 	 It added some scariness and also something 'classy', with the use of threatening violins and all.
1.0 	 A few weeks ago, I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, a rather enjoyable, thick-plotted (and goofy on some occasions) slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.
0.81 	 Then there's Robin, the good witch, who is just learning about her powers.
0.7 	 That was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches?
0.62 	 There is sort of a confrontation in the end, but it's a big disappointment.<br /><br />So, the acting of the two witches was good.
0.9 	 As far as that goes, it even manages to provide it's own spoilers.<br /><br />The story appears to be a computer nerd's fantasy world come true.
0.74 	 The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker (I think), among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you'll have to see for yourself.<br /><br />As well, I should've known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy... he tends to be a good tip-off.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one, I'm afraid.
0.61 	 (*)
0.73 	 But my inner five-year-old goes, "Yay!
0.86 	 Care Bears!"
1.0 	 So - I'd only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR those lovably cynical Gen-X/Y-ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad/strange (a category in which this movie...definitely belongs).
0.98 	 To those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment: You might want to keep looking.
0.98 	 For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play.
0.8 	 <br /><br />-Let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />Alan Rickman is alright, although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling.
0.85 	 Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog.
1.0 	 I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap.
0.75 	 Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then.
0.86 	 How this film gains a 6.7 rating is beyond belief.
1.0 	 If you wanted to see an actually decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways.
1.0 	 National Treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films.
1.0 	 I bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some haven't been widely released yet.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies.
0.98 	 When his talent is put to good use like in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation he is an incredible actor.<br /><br />Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again.
0.84 	 She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain.
0.53 	 But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the Princes, and also an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth.<br /><br />Complicated?
0.71 	 Yes.
0.54 	 Why would a "demonico" kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal?
0.77 	 And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle whenever she's out somewhere.
0.78 	 The "Faith's" lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes.
0.5 	 I wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster.
0.96 	 I got what I expected...but only half.
0.97 	 This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations.<br /><br />While I don't agree with another fellow IMDb user who states that the movie is overrated; I must admit that "PrÃ©te-moi ta main" has plenty of flaws.<br /><br />My main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters.
0.57 	 The film started out pretty well, but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock.
0.71 	 The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in.
0.99 	 Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer.<br /><br />In closing, this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made.
0.51 	 !
0.92 	 For several weeks this DVD leaped off the shelf at me every time I went in the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films previously, I didn't want to smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted, until finally I grabbed it up with a 'What the hell!'
0.64 	 I cannot wait to re-watch this again!
0.9 	 I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film.
0.99 	 Maybe in George Orwell's version there is a message worth conveying.
1.0 	 If this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read Orwell's classic.
0.66 	 If the film maker's message is "the mundane life is worth living", well then, they've succeeded.
0.99 	 You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff.
0.98 	 Lines were delivered as if from a robot.
0.71 	 There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through.
0.66 	 Not really a career-move, but I guess we all have bills to pay.<br /><br />To those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's my only explanation.<br /><br />To all who haven't seen this one: by all means, watch it and make up your own mind.
0.69 	 But lower your expectations to the floor (and then some).
0.97 	 I've seen it so many times, and I never get tired of it.
0.55 	 Including this time.
0.85 	 about it.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the one part of the story that ALWAYS felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a HUGE effect on me-- Ruth.
0.93 	 When she said, "Do you have to go?
0.92 	 ", combined with the music, I could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.<br /><br />Someone commented online that Ruth looked older than he was, yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years.
0.84 	 Which makes me think... MAYBE she was one of the teachers at the academy.
0.95 	 Maybe he meant, "...anymore.
0.86 	 But it seems SHORE LEAVE oughta be in there, too.
0.87 	 What are all those "people" if not androids?
0.85 	 Considering how much attention Dr. McCoy showered on her, it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again!
0.76 	 He was!
0.97 	 I really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time, rather than this "submerged" business.
1.0 	 And at the end, when he needlessly says, "Totally illogical!
0.96 	 ", I can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction.
0.95 	 But, again, if he is a linguist, and tops in his field, why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise?
0.51 	 .
0.95 	 She seems a nice enough woman, but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life.
0.92 	 The lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the Chomskys, for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, this sort of film gives almost no biographical background.
0.98 	 It's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears.
0.83 	 Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one.
0.95 	 He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades, when Castro and company were great sponsors of it, in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, until the Soviet Union fell.
0.82 	 In short, Chomsky is a man living in the past, in over his head on most issues, and out of his depth intellectually.
0.83 	 Near this film's end he warns, 'Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice,' yet one can only laugh, as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like, no matter how barbarous their crimes, and anti-intellectual their posit.
0.99 	 The story of a woman (Ann) on her death bed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past.
0.96 	 The flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young Ann is in the wedding of her friend Lila.
0.96 	 At the wedding she meets Harris who will impact her for the rest of her life.
1.0 	 Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love.
1.0 	 Her daughter Constance is older, more "responsible," a mother of two and has things together.
0.93 	 Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.<br /><br />First of all the good.
1.0 	 The period detail in the movie is great.
0.51 	 really put you in another time and place.
0.91 	 And there is some very quality acting in the movie.
1.0 	 Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end.
1.0 	 Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer).
0.96 	 Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us.
1.0 	 The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great.
0.99 	 They have fun and dance.
0.6 	 They fall for each other.
0.89 	 They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then...<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />They meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and I couldn't help but wondering why.
0.89 	 I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life.
1.0 	 There is a "touching" scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old Ann dreaming she's chasing a butterfly.
0.51 	 I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent "Short History of Nearly Everything" and what I was able to choke down in "A Brief History of Time," it sounded interesting at times.
0.99 	 MABEL AT THE WHEEL is one of those movies with a behind-the-scenes story that's more interesting than the movie itself.
1.0 	 This was Chaplin's tenth comedy for Keystone during his year of apprenticeship, and his first two-reeler.
0.92 	 Here he played one of his last out-and-out villain roles (although the feature-length TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE was yet to come), and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself.
1.0 	 Chaplin was still a newcomer at Keystone and his colleagues didn't know what to make of him, but everyone loved Mabel.
0.76 	 Producer Mack Sennett was on the verge of firing Chaplin when he learned that the newcomer's films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them A.S.A.P., so Chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way Mabel wanted it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of that drama is visible on screen in MABEL AT THE WHEEL, which looks like typical Keystone chaos.
0.98 	 The story concerns an auto race in which Mabel's beau (Harry McCoy) is scheduled to compete, but wicked Charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad, and Mabel must take the wheel in his place.
1.0 	 As a performer, Sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced, but you have to give the guy credit: he knew what people liked.
1.0 	 These films were hugely popular in their day.
0.92 	 I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it.
0.99 	 I'll never forget 'tunnel', for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema.
0.88 	 Keeping it still will help.
0.87 	 The context has little groundwork (which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads.
1.0 	 Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror) spending most of the time playing out a drawn out, noisy and relentless cat and mouse game.
0.67 	 <br /><br />As for being disturbing
 I guess that depends.
0.96 	 Too many cringe-moments arose from it, and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in.
0.92 	 Helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The performances; Jennifer Barnett, Angela Brunda, Danielle Lilley, Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workman-like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script's weaknesses in its character-foundation .
0.93 	 Her character's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non-existent.
0.97 	 Co-directors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources, but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle.
0.99 	 Maybe it was enjoyable to make, but watching it just wasn't the case.
0.84 	 Seldom do we see such short comments written by IMDb filmgoers.
0.95 	 I'd watch it again if I had some incentive.<br /><br />So what's a happenstance?
0.52 	 We've all had these (it's called life) but when looked at in this way, you begin to get the feeling that "random" might be more like "fated.
0.92 	 "<br /><br />A 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble.
1.0 	 It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'Mile' was just stupid and moronic.
1.0 	 Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex.
0.91 	 <br /><br />Anyway enough about the Naked Mile.
0.99 	 There are weak points though.
0.99 	 Coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first, I'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part.
1.0 	 <br /><br />While Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse.
0.89 	 You really can't care less about him.
0.9 	 The only reason I was bothered about his relationship was so Ashley could be on screen!
1.0 	 Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish.
0.51 	 Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time, but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this.
0.83 	 Perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone's pants pocket.
1.0 	 I played it beautifully throughout; promising myself I would walk away, but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto-magically transform into something engrossing along the way.
0.73 	 Recompense!
0.99 	 Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter.
0.81 	 In the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well.
0.5 	 Each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail.
0.97 	 And it looks like she's ordered the lobster."
0.68 	 See this film.
0.83 	 It's only 5 bucks and some change at your local Wal-Mart.
0.98 	 The entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Ms. Montgomery, who do not disappoint.
0.97 	 After all, even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice Catholic daughter, he's a nice Catholic cop who regularly brings local Catholic priest William O'Connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice - or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine.
0.67 	 The anal obsession even follows through to the film's title: despite the poster featuring a naked Japanese girl on a porn film set, the film's only direct example of Kinjite/forbidden subjects, as Alex Hyde White's English teacher explains to a group of Japanese businessmen, is, er talking about your bowel movements in polite society.<br /><br />Bronson isn't just too old for this, as the opening fight makes only too clear, he's too old for love interest Peggy Lipton, and she looks old enough to have grown-up kids.
0.96 	 The twin plot strands - Bronson's L.A. cop trying to take down Juan Hernandez's pimp who deals in underage girls and James Pax's porn-obsessed Japanese businessman Â take forever to intertwine, and then in the most unlikely of ways: after copping a feel of Bronson's daughter on a bus ("Some Oriental guy touched my holy of holies!
1.0 	 "), in the film's idea of poetic justice Pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by Hernandez.
0.95 	 If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced.
0.81 	 Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far.
0.5 	 The extras were cool too.
1.0 	 They deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.
0.65 	 But in this movie there's no real scene of action.
0.84 	 I think this movie should be nominated at the Oscars!
0.98 	 It would be very easy to dismiss "Fido" as cartoon-like fluff, similar to "Tank Girl", but the two movies are vastly different.
0.53 	 `Mad Dog' Earle is back, along with his sad-sack moll Marie, and that fickle clubfoot Velma.
0.97 	 The only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in Warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would count this an improvement.<br /><br />I Died A Thousand Times may be unnecessary Â and inferior Â but at least it's not a travesty; the story still works on its own stagy terms.
0.83 	 En route, he almost collides with a family of Oakies, when he's smitten with their granddaughter; the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame.
1.0 	 Arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up, he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as Winters, who throws herself at him (as does the pooch).
0.7 	 Biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel, Palance (to Winter's chagrin) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity, a gesture that backfires.
0.98 	 Then, the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath.
0.77 	 And one last, heretical note: Those mountains do look gorgeous in color.<br /><br />
0.99 	 I never saw an ad or a trailer, so I didn't know Clooney was in it and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small.
0.61 	 The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing at the side of the road, looking whipped and haggard, caught my attention immediately.
1.0 	 It had a way of telling you, "don't go away; this won't be boring", and it really wasn't.
0.9 	 The events kept building up so that you expect them to continue building, but at a point that I can't define, it sort of levels out, making the ending a slight disappointment.
0.86 	 what ends up killing this movie is its self-consciousness, among other things.
0.98 	 here's a short list: 1. irreverent behavior.
1.0 	 when the beatles came over and injected their brand of "quirky, irreverent" behavior/humor, it was greeted as fresh.
0.55 	 that was over 4 decades ago.
0.87 	 false sophistication.
0.9 	 It's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC).
0.9 	 I like to think that God is a little greater than that.
0.88 	 If I want to watch a documentary on the Cannes Festival, I will watch A&E....and they would probably be alot more objective about it.<br /><br />I dont recommend it, period.<br /><br />
0.99 	 Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy, and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed.
0.86 	 The fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place, and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action.<br /><br />The one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence.
0.99 	 But stick with it, and you won't be disappointed!
0.96 	 are very good Chase films, so he COULD be really funny given good material.
0.66 	 A phenomenal achievement in awfulness.
1.0 	 I've enjoyed LaBute's early films and a few of his plays...but it's a strange fascination he has.<br /><br />I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn's performance.
0.97 	 By the time she finally makes her appearance (bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead) it seems like all hope may be lost.
0.99 	 It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer.
1.0 	 The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for?
0.99 	 What a shame.
0.61 	 It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should've been.
0.67 	 I've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this.
0.99 	 The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York.
0.73 	 The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on.
1.0 	 The only good (and quite funny thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.<br /><br />I was very astonished, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie.
1.0 	 First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this... what happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"?
0.9 	 THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff.<br /><br />If you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this flick.<br /><br />Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
0.98 	 This movie is an absolute dud.<br /><br />Having been recommended to me by a friend very much into "that sort of thing," I watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed, changed, moved, altered, uplifted, and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when I suddenly see The Truth.
0.99 	 I try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.<br /><br />In terms of content, the only thing I found mildly interesting and informative, was the bit about peptides, emotions, addiction, and cellular receptors.
0.89 	 That was the only "unifying" element I could find in the documentary part of this film.
0.95 	 And what was all that stuff about native Americans not being able to see the ships that Columbus came in?
0.88 	 Had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition (the famous gorilla video, for example, visit the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of Illinois site) there may have been a more convincing point made.
0.64 	 I never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as "Pollack."
0.99 	 Elaine Hendrix's performance was totally unbelievable.
0.92 	 The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said.
0.76 	 These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together.
0.81 	 Obviously, I didn't care for Things to Come (aka "The Shape of Things to Come") as much as most viewers.
1.0 	 That means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than I did.
1.0 	 In my eyes, it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.<br /><br />The film opens in 1940 in a London-like "Everytown".
0.93 	 War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them.
1.0 	 Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath.
0.9 	 We see two pilots, one downed, coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting.
0.99 	 We meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society.
0.97 	 We see the way that technology is changing.
0.99 	 And finally, we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036, where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.<br /><br />That might all sound potentially very exciting, but it just does not work as a film.
0.97 	 There's a constant parade of new faces.
0.89 	 If features shots of building the futuristic city, with lots of large machinery, lots of welding, and so on.
0.92 	 I can't say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.<br /><br />But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is "a film about ideas".
0.93 	 One, it still doesn't make it work _as a film_, that is, as a visual and aural dramatic artwork, and two, there are far too many ideas presented here.<br /><br />The principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations.
0.97 	 It's also remarkably prescient of World War II, as the Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936).
0.56 	 Wells has some interesting things to say about war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film.
0.93 	 However, there are many more ideas here.
1.0 	 The scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film.
0.79 	 It deals with a complex dilemma.
0.96 	 One pilot has shot the other down, but is now coming to assist him.
0.97 	 A girl comes along.
0.53 	 They only have two functioning gas-masks between them.
0.61 	 The pilot who was shot down offers his mask, as he says he's dying anyway.
0.98 	 During the scenes featuring the would-be warlord, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a nasty contagious disease called the "wandering sickness" going around.
1.0 	 It's a great idea and deserved its own film.<br /><br />Similarly, Wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas.
0.61 	 It's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes, especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction.<br /><br />Still, there are reasons to give Things to Come at least one viewing.
0.99 	 If you're at all a sci-fi buff, this is a historically important film.
0.72 	 Given Menzies' background, the production and set designs are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated.
0.97 	 It's also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his "predictions".
1.0 	 I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of George MÃ©liÃ¨s' 1902 A Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage dans la lune).
0.98 	 Needless to say, the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic.
0.76 	 Remember the car that runs on water?
0.74 	 Remember the promise of nuclear energy?
0.98 	 In this case, it's a fabric that doesn't wear out, wrinkle, or even get dirty!
0.96 	 (Those Brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire.)
0.97 	 The film might chug along exactly like Guiness's goofy invention, but it's a good ride all the same.
0.93 	 Unexpectedly due a glitch the TV ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses.
0.96 	 Even as Carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell (the room full of whining infants), he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses.
0.53 	 The other movies you want to watch can wait.
0.54 	 See this first.
0.98 	 I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery.
1.0 	 Well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie.
0.78 	 Laila's dad, Cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of.
0.58 	 That was the first 5 minutes that is good.
1.0 	 Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride.
0.51 	 I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character.
0.72 	 You know, Jesus' mother.
0.88 	 Totally unconvincing for the job.<br /><br />The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that just is unreal.
0.89 	 {EDIT.
0.96 	 Playback}<br /><br />Never have I seen a director take so much flack for his style before.
0.97 	 Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her, no matter how much she suffered.
0.98 	 It's a mess, but it's a rather enjoyable mess.
0.93 	 It is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool", for one) but it works.
0.65 	 I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie-goers who graded this film Â but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well.<br /><br />7 out of 10
1.0 	 The first Tremors movie was great.
0.99 	 I wasn't disappointed.
0.95 	 By the end of the movie, I was awstruck.
0.82 	 I couldn't get it off my mind.
0.97 	 The whole idea of it just blew me away.
0.89 	 The ending, was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do.
0.55 	 I've seen it four or five times and I'm always finding something new.
0.67 	 Cushing is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum, is anything but "beautiful" as we are told to believe she is!
0.85 	 Someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle.
0.99 	 It's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.<br /><br />The plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title; initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?"
0.55 	 By the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, as they seem to be asking "weren't we better off back then?'.
0.9 	 This movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport, then things take a 180 degree turn...<br /><br />I for one, really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater.
0.94 	 lame, right?)
0.96 	 I give it a 9/10<br /><br />Segment 3 is the song Bad.
0.99 	 You're probably thinking it's Michael Jackson's Music video of bad,Well yes and no.
0.6 	 The segment was cute but it wasn't as good as the other segments.
0.99 	 Also at the end of the clip out of nowhere Michael Jackson rabbit costume comes to life and he's dancing with it.
0.95 	 I liked the dancing but that was like out of nowhere.
0.54 	 The weird thing about the Segment is why are kids hanging out with a grown man it never explained why.
0.57 	 My rating for this segment is a 8/10<br /><br />Segment 7 is the final segment of the whole movie.
0.98 	 Possible SPOILERS: Not Sure<br /><br />While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film.
0.83 	 But there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that The Lion King did.
0.71 	 Even the actor who does young Simba sounded enough like Jonathon Taylor Thomas for me.
0.86 	 But why did they even include a voice actor for Zazu?
0.95 	 He literally had only 2 lines, and neither were very necessary.
0.92 	 How did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas?<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, you can't help but feel that for a 2 disc set, the special features are especially lacking.
0.59 	 I enjoyed the "Who Wants to be King of the Jungle" game, even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion I've ever seen.
0.69 	 Well, these aren't the right circumstances.
0.5 	 At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now.
0.98 	 Was it worth the hype?
0.94 	 Was that Leonardo's real nose?
1.0 	 OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film.
0.61 	 Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank.
0.61 	 Jack and Rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.<br /><br />So does Titanic live up to it's hype?
0.59 	 Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special.
0.87 	 It's a lot like the Jeff Goldblum "Fly" movie.
0.89 	 The man manages to keep some semblance of sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments.
0.89 	 The guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter.
1.0 	 Then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son.
0.93 	 Admittedly, he is good looking, but he seems like a lot of trouble.
0.99 	 I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed... but then again I was only 12 years old.
0.64 	 I recently re-watched it and want that time back.
0.99 	 While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (watch My Bodyguard (1980)if you would like to see a GOOD movie that he was in... of Meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, this role does/did nothing for their careers.<br /><br />Anyway, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car (which he had in storage) across the country to California.
0.53 	 By this time around, the challenge for the filmmaker was to take such familiar material and make it seem fresh and new again; and, happily to say, with this film Donner not only met the challenge but surpassed any expectations anyone might have had for it.
0.76 	 I rate this one 10/10.
0.94 	 In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first.
0.89 	 It made me think "damn I really lucked out finding this movie".
0.95 	 The Moroni character is an absolute scream.
1.0 	 The corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of bubonic plague.
0.93 	 A whole slew of uncredited, non-professional actors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots.
1.0 	 The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy, quaint streets and sunshine.
0.92 	 One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who is always dashing from A to B.
0.75 	 Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello's flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes.
0.99 	 Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy kidnapped.
0.98 	 But he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness.
0.97 	 Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job?
0.91 	 If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film.
0.63 	 Who's origins are never revealed.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend.
1.0 	 The bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!).
1.0 	 No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)
0.99 	 It's not witty, it's not entertaining, it's not insightful, and it's not charming.
0.65 	 It's just a staid, laughless, progression of four losers who must change their ways - and their attitudes towards women - to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding.<br /><br />With acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society, a plot line so tired it'd make a forty third season of 'Allo 'Allo look fresh, and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables, Sione's Wedding nonetheless scored ten (yes 10) nominations in the NZ film awards recently.<br /><br />Fortunately, somebody saw sense and it didn't win any.
0.5 	 I would say it is very unrealistic - if you expecting anything serious, then don't bother, but it is very funny.
0.8 	 It actually made me think.
1.0 	 During the whole movie I was confused as hell.
0.91 	 This movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you.
0.6 	 She will never know how much that means to me.
1.0 	 I would recommend this film if you are a fan of his, but I do agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is sort of disappointing.
0.98 	 A couple(Janet and Richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp.
0.57 	 After camping and enjoying nature, the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house.
0.84 	 It's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers.
1.0 	 I found the film to be quite creepy.<br /><br />The flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film, which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering.
0.91 	 The acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue, at least in the early scenes.
0.57 	 It's possible to find it in the USED section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough.
0.97 	 It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out.
0.93 	 Only Hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice.
0.7 	 Goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...<br /><br />
0.91 	 ), what she was afflicted with.
0.95 	 Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has.
0.92 	 It does not achieve anything at an artistic level.
1.0 	 Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true.<br /><br />* Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams.
0.96 	 These scenes are not very effective.
0.96 	 I felt that the surrealism was lost.<br /><br />* The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement.
0.86 	 I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film.
0.66 	 Please.
0.53 	 I could not, however, afford a ticket to his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the U.S. tour.
0.98 	 I was upset to say the least.
0.77 	 <br /><br />I do have one complaint.
0.73 	 ***Might not consider this having a spoiler, but I'd rather be cautious than careless*** I never saw this movie when I was little.
1.0 	 You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the step-sisters; they were just awful.
0.77 	 This movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film.
0.78 	 Throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie.
0.87 	 See this one at all costs.
1.0 	 I was not impressed at all by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job.
0.67 	 That's about the only thing that reconciled this movie.
0.52 	 This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios' pre-screening process.
0.93 	 Also, beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay, and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story.
0.98 	 Particularly those entering the craft in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment.
0.99 	 There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects.
1.0 	 The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off.
0.94 	 I could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before, but they were all established before this was released.
0.51 	 !
0.95 	 He was one of my all time favourite actors.
0.53 	 A lot of American sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not, and this show didn't do that.
0.99 	 However, it's worth sitting through for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus the janitor, who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance.
0.64 	 One of the most peculiar oft-used romance movie plots is this one: A seriously messed-up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman, who turns his life around before dying.
1.0 	 Occasionally this story is done well and realistically (as in "The Theory of Flight", an excellent weepie), but more frequently it's done like it is here, where as usual the heroine dies of "Old Movie Disease".
0.68 	 Hey, it *was* the seventies!<br /><br />Marthe Keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest; her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying, and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of, say, Vanessa Redgrave or Julie Christie.
0.98 	 than anything like lovable.
0.89 	 While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story (even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver, B.C.
0.54 	 Afghanistan?
0.93 	 Come on guys!
0.94 	 Also, it's a bit ridiculous when people say things to Boyer like, "You're Spanish, aren't you?
0.99 	 "<br /><br />Still, the movie's not at all bad, just slow-moving.<br /><br />
0.91 	 Basically, if you start your day off meditating to the likes of Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you.
1.0 	 If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a sizable portion of good weed, then this movie is for you as well.
0.87 	 Take my word for it.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about "What the Bleep do you Know" is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparkles across the screen, and other assorted silliness.
0.99 	 Who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me.
0.99 	 Heck, the little play I was in when I was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this.
0.52 	 It really did.<br /><br />The story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors, and self-proclaimed mystics, go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life.
0.92 	 Reality, you see, is a probability-field of a bunch of different possibilities, and is only set in stone once you the Observer chose to notice it.
0.86 	 Furthermore, the Heidelberg Uncertainty Principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities, parallel universes, and such.<br /><br />Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the movie.
0.89 	 Throughout, sex is presented as dirty, ugly, and anti-enlightening.<br /><br />In any case, the talking heads talk, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker, and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with.<br /><br />I want 2 hours of my life back.<br /><br />Here's a couple of random quotes which I happened to remember:<br /><br />"What I think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me, and that, which I used to consider real, is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal."
0.69 	 I have you!"
0.59 	 Do not expect a depiction of the "truth".
0.92 	 <br /><br />My major criticism of the film is twofold: it is one-sided and it advocates anti-war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military's and Veterans Affairs' programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war.
0.53 	 Excellent movie, albeit slightly predictable.
0.84 	 I have to comment on Nicole Kidmans acting in this movie.
0.98 	 I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great.
0.99 	 ).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage to break out of her "Roswell" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always).
0.98 	 OK, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good.
0.93 	 Early on, from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face.
0.58 	 There seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net.
0.84 	 I'm inclined to be in the middle.
0.9 	 I'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (e.g.the cruel cutting of the story, badly rotoscoped charecters, over acting etc...) But dispite this I still love this film.
0.98 	 However, that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these "jokes" were just silly.<br /><br />This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart.
0.74 	 A film?
1.0 	 Quoting Zeitgeist?
0.82 	 Keep the TV Show and the interviews, but a film?
0.7 	 This might be just a personal taste, but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth.
0.55 	 Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism.
0.89 	 His humility that he only knows that he doesn't, is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non-sense.<br /><br />I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist, the movie in Bill's film.
0.84 	 Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship.
0.88 	 Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as "we don't know".<br /><br />This film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.<br /><br />Watch the film (it has hilarious interviews and bits) but PLEASE do not behave like Bill.
0.93 	 You cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line.
1.0 	 There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues.
1.0 	 This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film, "Double Indemnity," is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script.
1.0 	 Thus, the brand-new "Double Indemnity" eliminates the atmospheric black-and-white film-noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original.
0.82 	 Gone are the dusty, shadowy, claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost.
1.0 	 Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis.<br /><br />The look of Jack Smight's take on "Double Indemnity" is more "Dynasty" than film noir.
0.8 	 If not money, then perhaps murder for love or lust?
1.0 	 Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar, and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister.
0.91 	 Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind.
0.95 	 Only Lee J. Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes.
0.96 	 The 1973 "Double Indemnity" should be titled "10% Indemnity," because viewing it only underscores the 100% perfection of the original movie.
0.99 	 Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this, she's a great actress.<br /><br />This movie contains six stories.
0.8 	 It's a new concept flew over from Hollywood.
0.54 	 Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer.
0.99 	 She wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her.
0.96 	 Salman khan cannot play comic roles.
0.84 	 But in his serious parts he is marvelous.<br /><br />2.
0.96 	 Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla).
0.93 	 He gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman, with forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and kids.<br /><br />Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural born actors / actresses.
1.0 	 They are great.
0.89 	 Now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore.<br /><br />5.
0.99 	 He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz) who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but he is about to get married with an Indian woman.
1.0 	 Raju has to bring Staphani to that man, but falls in love with her.<br /><br />I never liked Govinda's movies.
0.98 	 But in this movie I liked him very much, like he has been growing up the last years.<br /><br />6.
0.61 	 There is Sohail Khan!
0.99 	 He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar).
0.98 	 He want to get some serious action with her, but every time her family comes in between.<br /><br />Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny!
0.69 	 All these stories aren't interesting.
0.94 	 Here and there the stories touch each other, but is not significant for the characters.<br /><br />My conclusion; Priyanka cannot act!
0.67 	 Salman Khan cannot act comic roles, but real serious movies.
0.95 	 This ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life.
0.84 	 These are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life.
0.54 	 And at the end, Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself.
1.0 	 It's awful, but that's just the way it is, isn't it?
0.99 	 A hint I think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread.<br /><br />I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it "mandatory" or "compulsory".<br /><br />I think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing.<br /><br />The Global Warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to "do right".
0.98 	 And a very successful one at that.
0.52 	 He just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would.
0.8 	 There is nothing unique in either the TV Series nor the Movie.
0.7 	 Which is a prequel to the TV Show, that isn't found everywhere else in life and entertainment.
0.99 	 Because of his ability to define misery and and tragedy and making it into some kind of a wonderful thing.
0.73 	 hmmm?
1.0 	 THE KING MAKER will doubtless be a success in Thailand where the similar (but superior) 'The Legend of Suriyothai' set box office records.
0.96 	 The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest, pedestrian scripts and story development on film.<br /><br />The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch) whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked, captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses.
0.53 	 There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul), after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness, are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards, only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to take over the rule of Siam.
0.88 	 Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now firm love affair with Maria) with the expected consequences.<br /><br />The acting (with the exception of John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp.
0.69 	 The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas.
1.0 	 But if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching.
0.99 	 It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions.
0.66 	 It is just the basics that are missing.
0.76 	 Grady Harp
0.86 	 I saw this when I was 17 and haven't seen it since.
0.82 	 I remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach.
0.75 	 I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh.
0.62 	 I have been looking for this for years.
0.86 	 I have no idea whether it was ever released on video.
1.0 	 This is a well made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline.
0.62 	 The problem is, Frontline already did this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story.
0.98 	 There is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well, it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting.
0.82 	 Well recommended at any rate.
0.67 	 It tells a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is.
0.63 	 I am not a big fan of traditional music either but I wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film.<br /><br />If someone told me to say something against this film I'd define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut.
0.88 	 There are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film, but these two actors are the ones the film can't do without.
1.0 	 ", and Silverstein answers: "No, I'm not your doctor.
0.77 	 You call me to have dinner; I'm your friend": we laugh because we can't help it.<br /><br />And we can't help laughing when DÃ­az crashes a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it, or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street, or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and Silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes it too because he's screwed up); or when Silverstein tries to be friendly with DÃ­az's robber friends.
0.66 	 This movie features Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club.
0.93 	 That it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking.
0.87 	 Although it got some favorable press after playing at the Toronto Intl.
0.75 	 Two -- it's written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers).
0.97 	 International Man of Mystery came straight out of the blue.
0.58 	 It was a lone star that few people had heard of.
0.99 	 But it was stunningly original, had sophisticated humour and ample humour, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast.
0.69 	 The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.<br /><br />OK I'll admit, the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny, but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws.
0.57 	 Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one.
0.79 	 Those characters who bloomed in the first one, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.)
0.54 	 The whole Mini-Me `make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly.
0.99 	 OK its not the best film I've ever seen but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!!
0.62 	 The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes.
0.51 	 We meet Brad: a good-looking, wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married guy, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence.
1.0 	 In plain language, they missed the point.
0.72 	 The exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests.
0.63 	 Unlike most movies made on partition, this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience, but on its after-effects.
0.99 	 Admittedly, at times, it has led to some fun discoveries.
0.88 	 Often times, the best that can be said is they definitely run an hour and a half.<br /><br />She brought home "Advice From A Caterpillar."
0.96 	 She was excited because the box said it was funny.
0.99 	 Until the introduction of the one nice character.
1.0 	 Then, they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (an almost perfect guy).
0.99 	 freak out as she falls in love.
1.0 	 So she tries to flee from the nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she's been having great but empty sex.
0.99 	 In the real world, she would have been quite successful.
1.0 	 I certainly wanted to flee from her and I wasn't even in a relationship with her!<br /><br />Although its nice that the man 'fought for his love', I never wanted her to have him.
0.98 	 And, why I wonder, did the director think that the 'almost perfect guy' should be punished by having to win a relationship with her?
0.95 	 When the artist was asking the 'almost perfect guy' to leave, we were screaming for him to leave too.
1.0 	 Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers.
0.95 	 O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble.
1.0 	 Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic?
0.99 	 "This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights ever since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system."
0.81 	 When "Politics" was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only a decade old.
0.79 	 And, the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group.
0.99 	 She wants the liquor-selling joints closed; and, is drafted into a Mayoral run, after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally.
1.0 	 Ms. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins).
0.95 	 Dressler's run for Mayor of Lake City draws opposition from men in town; so, Dressler orders the women to go on strike, denying them, "everything" in the "parlor, bedroom, and bath."
1.0 	 Producers might have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns).<br /><br />**** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
1.0 	 I would not call it vulgar ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid); I would call it shocking and offensive.
0.73 	 The gore elements are there, but you don't really feel anything for the characters, making the violence not very effective.
0.96 	 The deaths are all relatively quick.
0.99 	 Anytime Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to vomit myself.
0.69 	 It's kind of hard to explain why.
0.91 	 Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person's body. "
0.55 	 I found this film by mistake many years ago & wondered then (still do) why it didn't get the acclaim it should have.
0.89 	 without repercussion from the governments side (like, say, silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods).
0.98 	 Oh, and they still claim that they are being suppressed, of course.<br /><br />See how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get??
1.0 	 The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor.
0.79 	 I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place.
0.64 	 I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the "silly" or "stupid" choices.
0.98 	 My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef".
1.0 	 The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at a bottom of a local reef.
0.97 	 One day after a day of exploring they are approached by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason.
0.88 	 They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure that is reported at the bottom of the reef.<br /><br />Next day the four dive to the bottom of the reef and of coarse after a whole day of diving they find nothing.
0.9 	 He's rude, but they don't mind, as they think he's joking.
0.88 	 Of course, most seem "clichÃ©d", but the show takes the clichÃ© to a new level.
0.94 	 The one that never does two times the same thing and which is, compared to most sitcoms that are "cute funny", purely hysterical.
0.78 	 If you get hooked, don't let this show let you go.
0.83 	 Why?
0.61 	 I admit I was a bit leery when I heard about Batwoman and all I could think about were the old 50's comics of Batman.
0.83 	 But I was blown away by the Batwoman character, her look, her costume (which I assumed inspired Bruce Wayne to create the costume on Batman Beyond)and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who Batwoman is all the way through.
0.86 	 Barbara Gordon makes a cameo appearance and I think the writers were trying to hint that Bruce and Barbara had something going on between them like they did in Batman Beyond.
0.99 	 Pengy just didn't sound right.
0.69 	 Same thing goes for Robin.
0.75 	 The new guy did okay, but just as I was starting to get used to Matt Valencia, they replaced him.
0.82 	 The late John Vernon will be missed.
0.8 	 Hilarious, laugh out loud moments ... and yet not a comedy.
0.98 	 I believe it was made in that time also, but due to certain plot points, this doesn't date the film!<br /><br />As you probably guessed by my referencing to The Matrix, the world isn't real.
0.88 	 It's not really the 1980's.
0.76 	 In fact, it's something more like the 2480's.
0.96 	 After a nuclear war, the Earth(or "Biosphere Prime")'s ecosystem was destroyed.
0.56 	 The survivors we're forced to escape into space, where the conflict continued.
0.76 	 These characters are real people, not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet-time in The Matrix.
0.93 	 It may just choke you up towards the end...
0.62 	 This film is entitled Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to Faith Films website to find out any linkage to it here on IMDb.<br /><br />The filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good ... THEN, a line-reading actor spoke.
0.57 	 So this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain Paul's safety and freedom.
0.99 	 What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful.
0.73 	 No matter how good...bad you are.
0.97 	 There is no ending of a chapter to begin another.
0.74 	 Have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: Like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house?
1.0 	 I got nothing to complain about that woman, she's a perfect choice for this role.<br /><br />I consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and I can truly enjoy some really moody stuff.
0.92 	 It would be really cool if I can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall.
1.0 	 Let's be honest here, the acting is superb.
0.6 	 Beyond the mood, there's not much anything else here.
0.6 	 Granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there.
0.97 	 I still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express.
0.95 	 It's all that plus a good story and character development.
0.74 	 I consider the Lynch style of movie making cheating.
0.99 	 Therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting.<br /><br />This movie is not completely Lynch style, thank goodness.
0.82 	 It has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion.
0.81 	 It presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface.
0.98 	 It seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music.
0.56 	 The music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease.
0.96 	 And we are given very little about who the characters are.
0.74 	 All we have is this circumstance that just took placed.
0.56 	 The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily for their content, but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible.
0.95 	 The last sex scene is just foul, even before she gets to the guy.<br /><br />I'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate, which is why I picked this one up.
0.57 	 It's hard to rate films like this, because do you rate it on production or just fun?<br /><br />I saw this film back in about 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas.
0.82 	 Following the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy, the prequel Cube Zero.<br /><br />Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution, time and place unknown, two low-ranking operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers, some of which are rigged with death traps.
0.92 	 Suddenly it's realized that perhaps their "jobs" are not what they seem, and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted...<br /><br />For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this prequel will probably not be to your liking.
1.0 	 Standing alone, it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message.
1.0 	 It was also nicely self-contained.
0.63 	 Unfortunately for Barbarash, these are not enough positive qualities to save it.
0.95 	 Carlito's Way is set in the mid to late seventies.
0.85 	 We're supposed to believe that Carlito met all these people in the span of a few years.<br /><br />Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film.
0.98 	 It's also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film watching the events of Rise to Power.
0.86 	 Why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out, especially the good ones.
0.67 	 If I have one complaint with this film it is this: Don't ever let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again.
0.79 	 Its not supposed to have a plot, because its makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think)to believe it was a real snuff film.
0.99 	 This was an exercise in visual effects, and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does.
0.98 	 There still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing.
0.99 	 There is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film.
0.99 	 The rape scene was funny instead of shocking.
0.99 	 Although i'm sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror.
0.99 	 But since they probably suck at making films, they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off.
0.9 	 The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks.<br /><br />Its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating.
0.96 	 Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985.
0.99 	 The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film.
0.81 	 The movie has the longest, most tortured and agonized ending of any movie I've seen in a long time.
0.75 	 January Jones gives such a wooden performance, I was surprised she didn't go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film.
0.65 	 I don't really remember her from the other films she's done (a blessing I have to believe.
0.52 	 Take that back this has Studio exec crayola all over it.
0.96 	 al, performed well.
0.97 	 Not since The Bonfire of the Vanities have I disliked every character on screen.
0.99 	 A true b*****d, who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there, and people therefore suffer.
0.71 	 I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the UK.
0.76 	 It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes!
0.51 	 Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world.
0.88 	 However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try.
0.53 	 all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces) but the actual movie focuses on the individual, on triumphs and follies small and big.
0.99 	 "It can't matter", seems like the world is saying, to which Konchalovksy answers "it must matter" because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption.<br /><br />Yet behind this saga of 'man against landscape' something seems to hover, shadowy, almost substanceless, like the Eternal Old Man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists, sometimes a mere spectactor, sometimes the enigmatic sage; a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters, something invisible seems to lurk.
0.61 	 You spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story regarding the lead character?"
0.88 	 The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed.
1.0 	 It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots.
0.99 	 He looks like he's lost weight and is sick.
1.0 	 The humor is always medium-gauge, never unfunny but never gut-busting.
0.94 	 I also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary, as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself.
0.96 	 However, it really is a good film, because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time, it wasn't.
0.91 	 That's not at all what I mean.
1.0 	 There were movies which are painfully static and dull, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those that just don't give it a rest, sometimes in a good way and other times not.
0.99 	 This is one of the films that don't stop for a minute, and that is both a wonder and a pity.
0.99 	 There mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking.
0.8 	 It's completely crazy!
1.0 	 I was thinking the movie deserved a 5 (or a 6, tops) because the pacing was very poor, since it was insanely fast and I sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think.
0.99 	 The characters seemed to just running to and fro places, talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else.
0.94 	 I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache.
0.68 	 And you know what?
0.93 	 Despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic, their attorney and local police (who say they can do nothing) at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror.
0.97 	 Our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner.
0.78 	 This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings.
0.97 	 We call ourselves "civilized" however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.
0.96 	 The reviews I had heard were OK .
0.99 	 Even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self-serving, many do give it their all.
0.86 	 Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit.

0.88 	 R Balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensuous way.
0.99 	 This time it is mixed with mature humors.<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and owns an Indian Cuisine in London.
0.98 	 He is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job.
1.0 	 According to him, Cooking is an art.
0.9 	 Still cannot make Hyderabadi Biryani properly.<br /><br />Enter Tabu who sends her the proper Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other

0.98 	 The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage.
0.79 	 But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger to him.
1.0 	 And the complications begin
 Performance wise all three actors are brilliant.
0.94 	 The script of the film is very tight and interesting.
0.58 	 The dialogues of the film are catchy.
0.58 	 The comedy is sometimes not properly understood.
0.98 	 The camera-work is good.
1.0 	 ...that Jamie Foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful, Oscar-winning performance.
0.92 	 One of the reasons why I was so impressed with Foxx's performance in "Ray" was because from watching his hammy, obnoxious acting in movies like "Bait" and "Booty Call," I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar.
0.96 	 If people told me five years ago that Jamie Foxx was one day going to win an Oscar, I would laugh right in their faces.
0.85 	 Who knows?
0.97 	 Maybe he's better off sticking to drama, because if you watch "Bait," it's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte.
0.99 	 In real life, normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips.
1.0 	 Like Albert Brooks said in an interview discussing his character in "Taxi Driver," it's important to be funny as your character, rather than be funny as a comedian.
0.76 	 There are many scenes like that throughout the film.
0.94 	 I'm not even a big Mike Epps fan, but even his performance is good in comparison to Jamie's.
0.84 	 Epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy, but at least he chooses a more low-key approach.
0.99 	 One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is David Morse, a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains.
1.0 	 A big surprise, considering he gave a superb performance in "The Green Mile," also playing a heavy.
0.79 	 Antoine Fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like "The Replacement Killers" and "Training Day."
0.63 	 A spaceship returns from Mars; about a couple of months earlier, a 4-person expedition had been sent to the red planet.
0.68 	 Most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there.
0.98 	 Later, the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside.
0.75 	 The martian landscape, advertised as filmed in 'Cinemagic,' usually resembles animation cut-outs, or drawings, shot through an orange-red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors, who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process.
0.83 	 The one clever mention I did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality, so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista.
0.54 	 Nice going, lady.
0.88 	 the Terror From Beyond Space.
0.71 	 Instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...<br /><br />So thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Yes, the acting is bad so that's why it's not a ten, also the story line has received a lot of criticism.
0.89 	 The 1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more like "the real thing" (Think about it: would we really want to see the real thing?
0.62 	 Plus, if you remake it, you can show some stuff not shown in the original.
0.67 	 Truman's book was in fact not 100% true to the real story.
0.69 	 I thought the Canadian location sufficed for Kansas pretty much for a TV movie.
0.77 	 Now I find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like.
0.98 	 But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic...
1.0 	 I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible.
1.0 	 I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there.
1.0 	 Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker?
0.98 	 I do like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint.
0.98 	 Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s.
0.69 	 Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan.
0.94 	 One night I stumbled upon this on the satellite station Bravo.Initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it.To be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed.The main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well.You would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film!My only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays Melnik.Christ its bad!The prison guard Hank is woeful too.All he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co-guard Wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for Hank he gets down and dirty with Wanda near the end.
0.96 	 The death clues are the only interesting part of "Anamorph".
0.93 	 Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator, but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit.
0.51 	 - MERK
0.96 	 True, there was a much publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress.
0.76 	 Once she broke with Belasco, she did not go back to him and, in fact, started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life.
0.74 	 In the film also (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco.
0.8 	 Off-stage, fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing.
0.63 	 I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV.
0.56 	 **** 10+
0.84 	 So how on Earth you Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions.Stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests.
0.98 	 It is painful for those who love cars.
0.75 	 It is painful for those who love movies.<br /><br />I want my money back !!
0.51 	 !
0.79 	 This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store.
0.81 	 Odd.
0.92 	 Anyway, when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
0.54 	 Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of it's predeccesors can be good.
0.51 	 BHHAAAAD.
0.76 	 Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994.
0.99 	 But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher.<br /><br />The plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in Florida, but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman, and when he realizes that he was seen, well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff.<br /><br />Shallow Grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's, especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill, this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known, it's a pity it isn't.
0.98 	 this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes (just try guessing who the final girl is going to be - I got it totally wrong).
0.71 	 This, coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half-an-hour jars (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (the second murder provides a real jolt) and some unexpected sleaziness (even though this isn't a high budget thriller I didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast), in a film from this late in the 80's).<br /><br />There are one or two bad things about this movie, well not bad just minor, like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the Deputy inability to follow logic.
0.71 	 There aren't any sharp implements in SHALLOW GRAVE but, to my mind at least, it's a slasher flick through and through.
0.93 	 I have NOT seen this movie, but I must.
0.78 	 Figures
 From then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing.
0.78 	 Scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway.
0.96 	 The interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities.
0.95 	 The relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated EVERY SINGLE TIME by a five-second shot of the places.
1.0 	 The film did what it set out to do: show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity.
1.0 	 However, for most of us, this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here.
0.98 	 Even though their house was filthy, this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness.
0.74 	 This reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version, Big Edie says to Little Edie, "If you're stuck, it's only with yourself!"
0.9 	 This somehow ties into what I believe is her mental illness: her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead.
0.99 	 Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it.
0.91 	 During the stay Mr. Tom discovers how horrible the life has been for the William Â alongside his luggage his mom sent a belt and written instructions to the host of her son Â not to hesitate to use it.
1.0 	 *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* takes place in the turn-of-the-century Pacific Northwest.
0.87 	 Mrs. Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner, with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.98 	 though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabe's function in the whorehouse partnership.
0.99 	 <br /><br />*McCabe and Mrs. Miller*, purportedly "classic Seventies cinema", should be a lot better than it is.
0.92 	 The movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting.
0.93 	 There are some striking scenes, especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer.
0.99 	 But it's really, really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing.
0.92 	 (Nice.)
0.65 	 3 stars out of 10.
1.0 	 Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury).
0.95 	 This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason, so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting.<br /><br />There isn't all that much else here that's interesting though.
0.99 	 Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious.
0.97 	 There's an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who's also in love with the "femme fatale", but the Burr character is pretty straightforward.
0.82 	 It's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films I've seen him in.
0.86 	 This movie is about 1hr.
0.99 	 45 mins., and throughout that time, there was barely a moment where I wasn't laughing.
0.65 	 I have seen this movie so many times, and it is funnier every time.
0.64 	 ***** and two thumbs up!
0.99 	 In light of bad reviews - or car crashes - I feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due, and do a service.
0.95 	 I'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad, almost automatically.<br /><br />It's rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE.
0.7 	 This movie maintained suspense it's whole length, for me, despite any flaws that may be.
0.65 	 How many films can say that?
0.82 	 Not even many big ones.
0.88 	 Because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the whole movie.
1.0 	 It's not just a TV movie, but an all-action movie; there is no point where it stops, or deviates, or becomes talky.
0.67 	 It would be hard to make a film like this, always on the road.
0.55 	 The best thing in them also was the constant tension.<br /><br />ACTING is not bad: The Judge is as good as ever, and the others are.
0.93 	 But the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be - or seem to be - a little awry.
0.99 	 What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so.
0.99 	 Their only failing may be the noticeable, and again, apparent, slow speed.
0.91 	 But maybe that's my error.<br /><br />HOW TO SAVE THEM: Good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up.
0.98 	 Just a few inches would do.
0.96 	 A stunt driver could do that at 100 mph.
0.98 	 Odd that they didn't call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there's a way.<br /><br />I hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster.
0.96 	 Or at least neutral.
0.82 	 I guess we know why.
0.7 	 Initially striking the audience as filthy, crude and generally unappealing, his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts, culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own.
0.99 	 Compulsive house-cleaner Felix Unger (Lemmon), having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years, attempts to commit suicide, but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window.
0.78 	 Dejected, he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar (Matthau), a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches (that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat!).
0.84 	 The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement, with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly-nagging wife, and Oscar as the sloppy, unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to.
0.62 	 Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory, but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to Felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality.
0.99 	 Casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and/or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on IMDb, one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge.
0.84 	 So eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself.
0.95 	 In this case the term "dark psychological thriller."
0.97 	 Read: "hack writer/director who thinks he's an auteur, who replaces plot, story, and action, with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul.
1.0 	 His great insight?
0.99 	 Festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults.
0.99 	 Wow, I bet Freud would be really impressed!
0.97 	 The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot.
1.0 	 In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos.
0.85 	 Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier?
0.79 	 It was electrically operated (using power from from heavy storage batteries.
0.8 	 This massive machine pumped celluloid film strip (newly developed by the Eastman company) past a lens at about 40 frames-per-second (fps).
0.85 	 It was ensconced, as an almost immovable object, in the "Black Maria" (essentially the first movie studio.)
0.9 	 He had determined that, even at 16 fps on celluloid film, the persistence-of-vision of the human eye/brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived.
0.83 	 The images were projected on a screen five-meters distant from the lens.
0.63 	 The screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms.
0.87 	 Since each of his films would be about one-minute long, he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation.
0.93 	 Some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of Lumiere photographs.
0.86 	 But then the crank on the camera/projector was turned and movement began.
0.6 	 At the end, the gates to the factory are being closed.<br /><br />And this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public.
0.84 	 Cliff's airbag works OK & he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body.
1.0 	 She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured & horribly disfigured from the burns.
0.93 	 Cliff decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer & get rich while Abby's mum Pam (Linda Sorenson) wants to blame Cliff, get rich & save Abby.
0.94 	 However Abby has other plans of her own...<br /><br />This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt (whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn (2003) which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode) & was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I didn't think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I've seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same & still doesn't come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution (2006).
0.87 	 There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross (images & make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (1987) & it's sequels), then there's the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle & putting it into a cooler box!
0.97 	 Very messy.
0.86 	 Why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one?
0.55 	 Are police psychologists so easily taken in?
0.99 	 This is on a par with a Harlequin Romance.
1.0 	 The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price.
0.54 	 The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects.
1.0 	 The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were all great.
1.0 	 There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful... Why weren't they cast for that role?
0.99 	 City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to her family's rural digs, only to be faced with a mystery: why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways?
0.71 	 Sure.
0.63 	 He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series.
0.68 	 We get it, after about the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ?
0.71 	 Sure.
0.85 	 Nope.
0.91 	 Not a word.
0.83 	 Not to my ear.
0.85 	 A new low even for him!
0.78 	 THE PLOT 3.
0.87 	 THE PLOT 5.
0.93 	 THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6.
0.97 	 <br /><br />The story builds fairly well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil, and wonder when and how James will discover this.
0.75 	 ******* SPOILER!
0.68 	 How this has not become a cult film I do not know.
0.79 	 I think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!<br /><br />"Runaway Car" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good God it's bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh.
0.81 	 At one point I got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points.
0.94 	 When the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces, I was laughing hysterically.
0.52 	 He seems to get everywhere.
0.73 	 Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility.
0.68 	 And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve?
0.7 	 We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning.
0.99 	 Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.<br /><br />Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent.
0.99 	 He has his character's attitude and it fits him.
0.66 	 Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie.
0.91 	 Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana.
1.0 	 Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A "Red Scare" movie devoid of hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot.
0.98 	 Peters, as it happens, was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her, cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley.
0.61 	 What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults?
0.6 	 Genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who services daddy on the side.
0.68 	 Eventually, Genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going.
0.98 	 The script, however, is problematic.
0.98 	 You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary, except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set.
1.0 	 The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever.
0.97 	 Who the mermaid is is never explained, and its link to Christianity (which is hyped throughout the film) is nothing.
0.7 	 The film is very anti-Christian, as the archaeologist is a Bible spouting father, but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute.
0.61 	 There are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say.
0.97 	 I know I have no idea.<br /><br />So why am I recommending this film?
0.66 	 For the ladies, hunky Egyptian rides a horse completely nude.
0.88 	 Do you like snakes?
0.61 	 This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget.
0.82 	 Knowing Hooper somehow came up with "Crocodile" after this is rather sad.
0.97 	 "Night Terrors" is not perfect, but definitely worth a winking, unserious look.<br /><br />This is rated (R) for physical violence, some sexual violence, gore, profanity, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and drug abuse.<br /><br />
0.96 	 For those of you that don't that reference, clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body...<br /><br />Anyways, onto the review.<br /><br />I miss WCW Saturday Night.
0.54 	 They CLUBBERIN!
0.63 	 He was great.<br /><br />-DirrTy
0.88 	 "The Tenant" is a neglected gem.It may be difficult to track down,but it is more than worth the effort.
0.79 	 ((NB: Spoiler warning, such as it is!
0.69 	 Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions!
0.73 	 Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits.
0.96 	 Many of the American people would say...What???
0.85 	 to my opening comment.
0.68 	 Yes I know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right.
0.94 	 The local doctor treats carefully the blister, and asks Steve to investigate the location where they found the old man.
0.66 	 When Steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor.
0.94 	 The film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better.
0.92 	 Can I become a murderer?'
0.96 	 You cannot turn of the TV or your VCR without thinking about the plot and the end, which you should'nt miss under any circumstances.
0.51 	 Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn!
0.92 	 Some orange-headed guy projects himself on a laser, gets the touch of death.
0.96 	 Dull as Ethan Hawke - we're talking really DULL here, people!
0.97 	 Hopefully both she and Elvis were well paid.
0.97 	 John Carradine is good in his scene, but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes.
0.63 	 Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she did have a creepy smile at the end though.
0.77 	 The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz.
0.52 	 Then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc.
0.62 	 Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn.
0.52 	 Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled.
1.0 	 His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best.
0.5 	 Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
0.86 	 I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well.
0.84 	 Oooh, foreboding.
0.99 	 Great special effects.
0.92 	 OK, there is one surprise.
0.79 	 That's when Caine (Bacon) comes back one last time in the elevator shaft.
0.76 	 It was a surprise but only because you're yelling at TV, 'Noooo!
0.76 	 But the special effects were good; that's the only reason I give it a 2/10.
0.8 	 Love it or hate it, but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail-biting cliffhanger.
0.6 	 Can't wait for the next one.
0.7 	 All of the people reviewing this film, and probably many professional film reviewers, just don't get it.
0.97 	 If you are unable to locate a film, then read the reviews in AMG.
0.74 	 They will explain the processes used.
0.71 	 It is unfair to compare either of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technologies of the day, because both Zemen and Hines "do not compute".
0.88 	 It isn't easy making a bunch of computer cutouts flow.
0.76 	 Someone promoting the film should have tipped the audience off as to what they would be seeing, rather than let them blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work.
0.98 	 Regarding the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, in that many of Zemen's actors were somewhat expressionless at first, but became much more engaging as the film and action went on.
0.91 	 Nothing that appears on T.V.
0.9 	 is an accident.
0.98 	 Too much money, time and work is put into the production of a T.V.
0.98 	 show for there to be mistakes.
1.0 	 This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid.
0.82 	 This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile.
0.68 	 It's a lot like Pee-Wee's Playhouse for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something glue sniffing, Future Pornstars of America from the Valley.
0.69 	 Does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or DVDs that may be floating around out there?
0.71 	 No way.
0.7 	 Yet there is the slightest sense that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be as good.
0.69 	 He has only returned because he thought his father was dying.
1.0 	 Some happy endings are so contrived as to embarrass not only their contrivers but their audiences.
1.0 	 And some are so blatantly condescending that the audience is offended.
0.96 	 Joe and his friends don't believe him but Billy assures them and bets Joe that he can eat ten worms in one day otherwise he will come to school with worms in his pants.<br /><br />The boys take Billy up on his bet, leaving the weak stomached child with a mission to gain respect from his classmates by eating worms cooked, fried, or alive.<br /><br />The film may sound gross but there are a lot of messages in it.
0.98 	 Nevertheless, I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what.....titillating!<br /><br />B) The ending is romantic and positive.
0.96 	 That it's contrary and "over the top" is relevant.....yet for me was still a positive point.<br /><br />C) Dougray Scott plays an amourous friendly guy........REFRESHING!
0.93 	 THANK YOU!
0.75 	 <br /><br />2/5, not worthy of your 10 or so dollars.<br /><br />2/3's of the way through, I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend.
0.62 	 can't wait for the next Love Actually with JLH!
0.73 	 So sad that it's gone.
0.98 	 Of course I wonder about the reasons it was canceled.
0.98 	 There is no way I'll let myself believe that Ms. Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it.
0.98 	 And that's why it earns a 7, because the plot is not especially devious, and thinking back over the last 90 minutes I never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters.
0.95 	 The first hour plods along, and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit stagey - people wait for each other to finish and don't always react in a natural cadence, which would be a problem of recording each individual's dialogue separately.
0.52 	 I'd argue that the whole point of using drawn animation (instead of actors/CGI) is to really push the limits of imagination and design; to do that which is too difficult/impractical in other mediums.
0.58 	 Perhaps it would break from the 'noir' rules that the film wants to stick to, but I think the film-makers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more - the social strata, the fascistic grip of the corporations etc.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending Renaissance to anybody who enjoys stylistic design and/or animation ('Manga' fans in particular), but I wouldn't make my other film-loving friends sit through it.
0.53 	 <br /><br />There are no credits of the persons they interviewed, so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard.<br /><br />Tells the story from just one point of view.
0.98 	 Balcans are complex as human history is.
0.63 	 I am now on 96.
0.99 	 Beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have.
0.98 	 People who haven't read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of Nancy.
0.77 	 I solved the mystery myself!
0.6 	 I suggest you go see it since people who have been complaining know nothing of A what a good movie is and B about Nancy Drew.
0.75 	 Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, the ones from former Soviet Union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what Americans have been working for.
0.88 	 It was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world.
0.53 	 Trick Or Treat has every element for a movie that rocks.
0.81 	 Yes thats right, they use records in this movie.
0.98 	 As a teenager I tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine.
0.52 	 I just saw "If
" I can remember the advertisements for the movie from 1968, so I was interested in finally seeing it.
0.68 	 For another, whether the last scene is real or imagined, what occurs isn't a revolt, but a shooting rampage.
0.91 	 One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech.
0.59 	 They are adults, or close to it.
0.86 	 Change your shoes?"
0.78 	 So it is here.
0.54 	 He's got a keen ear for dialects, it seems.
0.94 	 For example, when Kenny (James Frain) asks Ginger (Ian Hart) why he does "it", Ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer.
0.83 	 Why?
0.92 	 But, like a lot of other seemingly intelligent men, he is sucked into a gang lifestyle not even realizing it...'til it's too late.
0.99 	 The problem with family dramas is that, outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people don't want to watch them.
0.58 	 Movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular.
0.99 	 It placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their "special dramatic episodes" then it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film.<br /><br />When you watch the DVD and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternate endings, you can really see all of this is sharp focus.
0.96 	 Essentially, Spock, McCoy and Kirk beam down to Sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and Mr. Atoz, the librarian.
0.55 	 All 3 Trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of Sarpeidon's past.
0.8 	 In the end, all 3 Trek characters are saved mere minutes before the Beta Niobe star around Sarpeidon goes supernova.
0.98 	 (p.272) The only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both Spock and McCoy travelled thousands of years back in time, McCoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just Spock.
0.99 	 But this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant Spock/McCoy performance and the originality of this script.
0.88 	 Who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of Sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past?
0.99 	 (p.273) While my personal opinion is that 'And the children Shall Lead' is a very poor episode while 'Is there in Truth no Beauty' is problematic, "All Our Yesterdays" certainly belongs on the list of top season three Star Trek TOS films.
0.51 	 Jungle Fever is too highly stylized, stereotyped, and comes across as essentially dishonest.
0.55 	 I made it through most of the film but I couldn't quite finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.
0.98 	 A disinterested look at the life of policemen.
0.55 	 Minuses: The violence and the gore, but I guess they add to the realistic effects.
0.99 	 Still, having people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided.<br /><br />No complaints - 7/10
0.75 	 Incredible.<br /><br />I wish'd it would never end.<br /><br />Lucy Liu is a throwaway role.
0.58 	 Anyone could have played it.
0.95 	 To understand these flaws, read "Christians Will Go Through The Tribulation" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture" by George E. Ladd.
0.56 	 This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film.
0.93 	 - Even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider New England or New York City to be such a place.
0.69 	 It is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash.
0.95 	 The film is rape/beating and revenge genre.
0.93 	 Bellow Hollywood !
0.56 	 This director should be banned...It is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by British cinematography which I personally like and that is the reason I've watched this.
0.87 	 This documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue.
0.98 	 Scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "An inconvenient truth" but frankly...what a description!!!
0.72 	 This is a re-imagining of Tarzan in the era of the Soloflex and Apocalypse Now.
0.63 	 Bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video-centerfold, as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project.
1.0 	 Some really great film moments incorporate it.
0.95 	 But this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here; at the time of its release and now.
1.0 	 Yes... Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe are beautiful (um, congratulations on having a working libido.)
0.96 	 The question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone.<br /><br />As a showman, John Derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife Bo in the movie "10"; and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads.
0.97 	 Don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs.
0.98 	 It has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally made) is really not about that at all.
0.65 	 It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society.
0.83 	 Why?
0.95 	 As far as the scene about logic, it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level.
0.55 	 It just might go way above your head; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem.
0.99 	 Woody Allen, when at his best, has one of the sharpest pens around.
1.0 	 The set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while.
0.97 	 Four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama.
0.67 	 To help settle the argument, one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing (one a comic playwright, the other a dramatic playwright) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy.
0.65 	 The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave.
0.99 	 Now, when I first heard about this film, my understanding was that they tell the exact same story, the genre (comedy or drama) only changes by how you look at it.
0.79 	 Now that would have been interesting.
0.96 	 However, the stories only share one main element and a few side elements.
0.85 	 They are entirely different stories with major plot differences.
0.94 	 The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting.
1.0 	 Woody is the best at being Woody.
1.0 	 This type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story.<br /><br />My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than I walked in.
0.73 	 The only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with "Journey to the Center of the Earth" is the title.
0.91 	 In fact, the director has written here at IMDb.COM that he directed only eight minutes of "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and the studio tacked on part of "Dollman" helmer Albert Pyun's sequel to his own "Alien from L.A." with Kathy Ireland.
0.98 	 Two fellows, a British nanny, and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence.
0.83 	 Richard (Paul Carafotes of "Blind Date") and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan (Ilan Mitchell-Smith of "Weird Science") are going out to explore a cave.
0.98 	 The heroine, Crystina (Nicola Cowper of "Underworld"), works for a domestic service called 'Nannies R Us.'
0.83 	 Being a nanny has been Crystina's life-long dream, but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs.
0.84 	 Nevertheless, her sympathetic supervisor, Ms.
0.99 	 Ferry (Lynda Marshall of "Africa Express"), sends her to Hawaii.
0.57 	 Crystina's new client, rock star Billy Foul (Jeremy Crutchley of "Doomsday") who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career, has a dog named Bernard.
0.99 	 Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa.
0.82 	 Anyway, Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard.<br /><br />After she catches up with them to get her dog, the cabbie cruises away and abandons her.
0.97 	 Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town, but he has other plans.
0.86 	 Unhappily, Crystina joins the guys and they get lost, and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis, a police state ruled by a dictator, at the center of the Earth.
0.99 	 The ruler of Atlantis, General Rykov (Janet Du Plessis of "Operation Hit Squad"), is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human, Wanda Saknussemm (Kathy Ireland of "Necessary Roughness"), to visit Atlantis.
0.58 	 I watched part of this on T.V.
0.66 	 recently.
0.98 	 But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience.
0.87 	 OK, so the Oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year.
0.66 	 Yeah, yeah.
0.82 	 I wonder whether or not Woody Allen will ever attend the Oscars again.
0.94 	 A friend and I went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment.
0.76 	 For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre.
0.87 	 There's also a few very amusing scenes.
0.61 	 10 out of 10!
0.77 	 I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc".
0.87 	 With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated.
0.57 	 Plus, an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film (like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY).<br /><br />The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou.
1.0 	 The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots.
0.71 	 Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special.
0.62 	 THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series.
0.91 	 Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode.
0.61 	 Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, I didn't enjoy Sid Caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters (ironically that very year, 1981, Caesar's old partner in comedy, Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES).
0.63 	 Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum.
0.97 	 Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a "typical" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters?
0.95 	 <br /><br />I suppose you can call it by the slang word "artsy".
0.76 	 At least for me.
0.58 	 Giving credit where it's due, only the technicolor, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount.
0.71 	 The over-the-top jokes, that are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them.
1.0 	 It's a flawed film, but a must see for any Hartley or 'Henry Fool' fan.
1.0 	 <br /><br />And don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first film.
0.74 	 It's a sequel.
1.0 	 That's just dumb.
0.5 	 The Punch-Dance.
0.99 	 Rod "needs to go to his quiet place" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is footloosing a passionate, overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big-hair faux-metal chops of Europe.<br /><br />2.
0.88 	 John Farnham's You're The Voice.
0.77 	 How did the film-makers even come across this Aussie recording artist?
0.94 	 Maybe it's got something to do with the fact he's driving a moped into the heart of darkness.
0.77 	 Ian McShane must've lost a bet to be here.
0.66 	 Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over.
0.96 	 I just wonder how that came to be made.
0.79 	 There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there.
0.93 	 If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose?
0.53 	 I understand that the BBC plan to make some more (not necessarily based on M R James stories) so that's promising.<br /><br />10/10
1.0 	 Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys.
0.99 	 It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren.
0.85 	 I admit that I am a vampire addict: I have seen so many vampire movies I have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten.
0.91 	 If you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.
0.96 	 I normally only write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked.
0.64 	 And, as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there, I didn't like it.
1.0 	 Using Chaos theory as a theme was interesting.
0.9 	 I guess the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God(s) causes Tsunami to bring back statue."
0.99 	 I thought Kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me off guard.
0.66 	 And then, an ex-CIA agent who's after the vial figures out it's headed for India.
1.0 	 A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available.
0.78 	 You'd think he would be killed, but instead, the magic bullet has cleared his tumor.
0.56 	 You read that right, a BULLET knocked out the tumor.
0.96 	 <br /><br />Pros...
0.7 	 The Naidu Character: Possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy.
0.72 	 This move was on TV last night.
0.94 	 This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women.
0.93 	 Fine.
0.92 	 It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man.
0.93 	 Fine.
0.93 	 Fine.
0.91 	 It continues in this vein for a while until, in the end, it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter.
0.98 	 I was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie.
1.0 	 However, the movie really didn't need explanation.
0.95 	 I also think Mandy62 was a bit unkind to Hugo Weaving.
0.8 	 Not a giallo, this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant 'phoned in' performances.
0.62 	 I reckon he turned up, did a day's work and cleared off leaving Mr D'Amato to get others to fill in.
0.96 	 Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood!
0.99 	 If you liked "Blair with" you'll like this one.
0.68 	 He is an icon and a very good actor as well.<br /><br />No, seriously.
0.55 	 Between DVD and the theaters, I've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear).
0.91 	 kind of experience?
0.78 	 Bad in every respect.
0.68 	 If you like a good "B" movie, and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch, you will like this.
0.97 	 The kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty.
0.99 	 Well, maybe the PC version of this game was impressive.
0.52 	 I'll mention those first because it will be over quickly.
1.0 	 First, the idea of a historical GTA-like game is a great one.
1.0 	 The game Gun was a historical GTA-like game and unlike Mafia, Gun was excellent.
1.0 	 I'd love to see a game set during Mafia's era done right.
0.89 	 Next, the storyline is well written.
1.0 	 The story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device (with much of the game being a backstory) and it's interesting.
0.99 	 Finally, some of the graphics--especially those used during cutscenes--are impressive.
0.85 	 That has to be the first focus of any game developers.
0.9 	 Here, it's not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge.
0.93 	 For example, Tom has to climb on a couple missions.
0.96 	 And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you're also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything.
0.8 	 My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AI's mercy again.
0.81 	 So much for realistic fighting.<br /><br />And the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns.
0.61 	 If you're touching someone, half the time the controller just won't allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes.
0.61 	 The city wasn't very well designed.
0.93 	 It's not varied enough, and there aren't many interesting things to see or do.
0.61 	 They also all drive about the same.
0.69 	 Oh dear.
0.94 	 good cast, but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task.
0.77 	 Even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right.
0.92 	 It may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task.
0.63 	 I would comment on it more but It has been 10 years since I saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind.
0.92 	 Save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away.
0.63 	 I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it.
0.65 	 However, I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy.
0.7 	 The poet-compiler of the Nibelungenlied didn't know a Hun from his right ball, and as a result they are, more or less, the same as the Burgundians in custom.
0.87 	 For example, although the poet clearly describes Etzel as a heathen (which is Kriemhild's main concern as Rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him), when she gets to Hunland, the first thing she does is go to mass.
0.99 	 The Huns here are clearly heathens; they're almost like caveman.
0.81 	 All he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem.
0.57 	 The one thing I do have to object to is the way Harbou changes the ending.
0.89 	 When Hagen still refuses, she decapitates him.
0.95 	 Hildebrand (or possibly Dietrich) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he, in turn, decapitates her, calling her a "Devil Woman".
0.99 	 Etzel, who is much weaker in the poem than he is here, says something silly like: "Ah me!"
0.61 	 But, to have Kriemhild kill herself, adopting Brynhild's death from the Icelandic sources, is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them.
0.95 	 The first Cube movie was an art movie.
0.99 	 It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand.
0.99 	 It was, on the non-literal level, a "man vs. cruel nature" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace.
0.55 	 yeah the war was on full swing (pun intended), and this movie gave the troops and our audiences a treat.<br /><br />but let's have something with a bit more substance.<br /><br />loved seeing a young Buddy Rich on the drums.
1.0 	 so if you're one from the "greatest generation," as they say, you'll definitely enjoy this...<br /><br />movie.
0.98 	 I won't claim to be a fan of Ralph Bakshi, because i am not.
0.98 	 Sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent, especially near the end of the movie.
0.85 	 I did notice however that though there was blood shed, the blood splatters were kept to a minimum.
0.57 	 Again, a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too "over the top".<br /><br />Though i do not recognize any "big names" in the cast, the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys.<br /><br />Did i say bad guys??
0.96 	 yes i did.
0.94 	 Nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clichÃ©s that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens.
0.85 	 Anyone looking for "depth" would be sorely disappointed.
0.96 	 THe characters are not given much development and some of them like Nekron and Darkwolf are one dimensional at best(I did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains Darkwolf's obsession with killing Nekron and his mother.
0.86 	 Definitely not.
0.95 	 The story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district.
0.99 	 When a captain is put under arrest, he IS under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept.
0.91 	 This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room.
0.54 	 My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.<br /><br />Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, all the rest is bulls**t.<br /><br />When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this film gets an extra dimension.<br /><br />If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: Thas Boat.<br /><br />
0.95 	 Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue?
0.99 	 Say what you will about schmaltz.
0.97 	 "<br /><br />In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the 9/11 murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance.
0.99 	 It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed.
0.69 	 I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler.
0.83 	 And, finally, old, old Michael Corleone falls over and goes 'THUMP!'
0.64 	 Let's call this one "The Cosas of Our Nostras" or "All My Capos".
0.94 	 As someone who's encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life, I can say without exception, that I've never met any mobster as inwardly-conflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone.
1.0 	 In this film, Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future, perhaps even the Afterlife, then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is, deep down.
1.0 	 After the break-up scenes in G2, we may hope that Michael & Kay will reunite as man and wife, but here they seem to just become very good, platonic friends who can laugh & cry & share intimate thoughts about their lives.
1.0 	 It's bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years.
1.0 	 Then, there's Andy's character, Vinnie Mancini, who's also given a difficult & thankless role to play.
0.99 	 He's expected, I guess, to be the new, new Don Corleone, but he's almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position, unlike Michael's simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1.
0.72 	 Certainly, Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday, but there's little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man, sadly.
0.99 	 Puzo did such a fine job of quickly & concisely developing Michael's character in G1.
0.97 	 The development of Connie Corleone's character is interesting, but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands (she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos, if this were the real world).
1.0 	 The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty!
1.0 	 Also, "they keep pulling me back in" or words to that effect is a great line.
1.0 	 The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed.
0.74 	 All screenwriters need to learn that we don't always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion.
1.0 	 Then, Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century, in Sicily, alone on a grand estate, of heart-failure...no grandson to play with before his demise, no wife to grieve for him.
0.8 	 What SHOULD have happened in the last 1/2 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani, put on trial, all his dirty family's sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day, Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life...then he can keel over dead from heart-failure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH.
0.99 	 I love movies.
0.99 	 I love independent efforts and major studio productions.
1.0 	 I love films with stars and I love those featuring unknowns.
0.94 	 I love dramas, comedies, action-adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror.
1.0 	 I love foreign films as well as those in English.
0.96 	 Except for "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.
1.0 	 "<br /><br />When I attended a late-night showing of "Cowgirls," I joined an audience of around 10.
0.56 	 It tries to be funny, but its humor is coarse and cringe-worthy.
1.0 	 This is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos, by depicting protagonists in so off-putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values.
0.58 	 Except for the new "Alexander."
0.64 	 The summer has been so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that I was woe to find a film I could just sit down and enjoy.
0.77 	 I get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.<br /><br />By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust.
0.96 	 I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichÃ©d from here to breakfast.
0.73 	 Don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief...
0.97 	 It didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you).
1.0 	 It's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough I could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy I hate those).
0.68 	 then you should really see this movie.
1.0 	 In fact, he's absolutely bonkers, but tries not to be too obvious.
0.95 	 He's got an entourage too, his own little demon & angel that follow him around.
0.98 	 The demon never says a word but really, doesn't have to, and he's Max Schreck-creepy.
0.98 	 It's a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really lay my finger on.
0.76 	 A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks.
0.83 	 If this movie is a horror movie, it's only horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror.
0.72 	 He becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her: he wears her clothes, puts on makeup, talks like her.
1.0 	 A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy, but it's an experience nevertheless.
0.95 	 I didn't know what to make of this film.
0.76 	 I guess that is what it was all about really.
0.98 	 I really like this guy, he is just so bizarre I can't help it.
0.54 	 They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance.
0.99 	 Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.<br /><br />The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily.
0.93 	 Hang on a second, I think I'm going to cry...<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't read Sheila Burnford's book, so I don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie.
0.99 	 There were a few interesting moments (e.g., Judy Tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting Judy-ism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one.
0.52 	 Nope, though I at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later.
0.96 	 or "For goodness sake, get ON with it!"
0.98 	 I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film.
0.99 	 This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last.
1.0 	 as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them.
0.64 	 They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck.
0.76 	 His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo.
0.96 	 The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers.
0.56 	 I am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film.
0.65 	 Do not read further...here it comes, avert your eyes!
0.87 	 The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is murdered here.
0.99 	 This amazing martial arts fighter doesn't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers.
0.88 	 Overall, a depressing and upsetting movie, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as Hero by a long shot.
0.77 	 I was really surprised with this movie.
1.0 	 Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest.
1.0 	 I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work.
0.96 	 Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!
0.53 	 ), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
0.76 	 Pandro S. Berman was "In Charge of Production" but that made him the so-called Line Producer.
0.94 	 The minor technical faults can and must be forgiven.
0.88 	 What's unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although maybe the Academy didn't offer such at the time.
0.99 	 Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who, luckily, happens to be travelling with them.
0.73 	 Chainsaw time!!
0.88 	 The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters.
0.51 	 ?
1.0 	 Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters.
0.95 	 But other things do matter, such as the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide.
0.98 	 A serial femme fatale, she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either Bedlam or Newgate.
1.0 	 Yet Lady B. is irresistible to all three principal male characters-- Michael Rennie, James Mason, and Griffith Jones, all of whom do good work, as does Patricia Roc.
0.55 	 Of course, all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down - accidentally, in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts.
0.81 	 Given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward, I presume we're meant to give a damn about her death.
0.9 	 Sure the story may have been thin at times, but you can't take away from the way it was done.
0.99 	 Unfortunately, as far as I could see, they sometimes were gratuitous, sometimes witty, often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection.
1.0 	 In particular, two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed.
0.9 	 On the whole, the zooms were, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trite.<br /><br />Other Almanesque devices, such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject, succeeded in suggesting characters' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge.
1.0 	 Was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, perhaps?
0.81 	 And except for a few slips out of Georgia into Chicago on the part of (brunette?)
0.84 	 If Saura hadn't done anything like this before, Iberia would be a milestone.
0.93 	 Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over, sigh, or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something.
0.86 	 There is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie.
0.65 	 You never know what is going to happen next.
0.89 	 You just don't know what going to happen next.
0.98 	 They producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too.
0.84 	 10 out of 10 the whole way!
0.64 	 Yeah, I "get" Pasolini and his milieu, but at the same time, I feel his "Decameron" is largely overrated, and more than a little disturbing.
0.98 	 Overrated because the supposed "realism" he introduces (milling crowds, crumbling architecture, etc.)
0.93 	 In my opinion, a far better-crafted film (and with MORE homosexual content) is Fellini's "Satyricon".
0.93 	 It is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its pacing, direction and strong storytelling whereas "Decameron" fails by those same elements.
0.79 	 He is the sidekick of the cult leader.
0.84 	 The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people.
0.74 	 For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw, Igor upon seeing this, yells out "Paul!
0.87 	 In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now, it was his time to operate.'
0.89 	 I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes out.
0.88 	 Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them.
0.99 	 And it's not all sap!
0.99 	 Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case.
0.72 	 My only word of advice: Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal...cornyness!
1.0 	 I suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
1.0 	 Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was, I didn't go and see this film at the cinema.
0.85 	 After watching it on DVD, I have to say I regret that now.
0.65 	 I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact.
0.9 	 It was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians, watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly).
0.92 	 I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf, for a change.<br /><br />When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered.
0.58 	 Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River anytime.
0.55 	 <br /><br />Yet Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now.
0.96 	 And boy didn't they had have it coming?
0.98 	 The group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy.
0.94 	 <br /><br />And all of this top-notch direction and acting isn't too slick or buffed to loosen the film's emotional hold.
0.54 	 "One false move and you're in over your head."
0.62 	 <br /><br />Perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to factors you have no control over.
1.0 	 <br /><br />(One nit-pick of an aside: This otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn't seem out of place on Mystery Science Theater.
0.88 	 The Ladies Man is a funny movie.
0.81 	 Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny.
0.7 	 Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows.
0.79 	 Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs.
0.54 	 But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one.
0.91 	 Had never heard of it previously.
0.95 	 Don't know why it wasn't marketed that well.
0.56 	 When DVD's were released en mass, it was one of the first movies I replaced.
0.69 	 Plus, the back drop of Montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either (beautiful).<br /><br />It's probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is?
0.82 	 If Adam Sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea.
0.92 	 One previous reviewer called this film "pure visual joy" I am wondering if s/he saw the same film that I did.
0.65 	 Of course, before they do that, one has to watch opium-den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit.
0.99 	 The movie also states that the Sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now.
0.94 	 Curly in drags is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface).
0.76 	 Moe calls Curly Senior Cucaracha.
1.0 	 The three stooges end up going to party where Curly is going to dress up in drags.
0.99 	 The stooge are pelted out of the room.
0.59 	 It cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority.
0.56 	 Please change it.
1.0 	 This was a less than exciting short film I saw between features on Turner Classic Movies recently.
0.7 	 In particular, I really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated--such as when the characters talked to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "ma'am", "Miss Barton" or "Clara".
0.68 	 Plus, one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a "Johnny Reb, A Confederate a Rebel,..."--almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls.
0.81 	 However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none.
0.65 	 Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours.
0.8 	 I saw the version on video called Rosemary's Disciples.
0.93 	 The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the "owner" of the town are allowed in.
0.86 	 Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr. Cato - the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back(hence the name Necromancy).
0.97 	 Mr. Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger-than-life movie maverick Orson Welles.
0.68 	 Welles is misused, but, make no mistake, he is the best thing in this movie.
0.83 	 In one scene at a party, director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames!
0.66 	 As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman's arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash.
0.77 	 The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens: many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed.
0.91 	 The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent.
0.56 	 This is not a good movie in any way under any name.
0.69 	 ),it's also an offbeat movie ,but it's gripping,suspenseful.Here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The final episode of the 10th season "Unending", where (it would certainly appear that) the Asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief!
0.99 	 This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin's best.
1.0 	 Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by some very authentic-looking prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this cast.)
0.75 	 Horror fans should check this one out.
1.0 	 The script manages to throw everything into a near-fever pitch, but without making it incoherent.
0.99 	 The speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up a weak script, but rather to accurately reflect the drug-addled reality.<br /><br />As director, James Cox as a very peculiar way of working his actors.
0.98 	 Most of the characters are perpetually on edge, and often because they're rather quite ugly personalities.
0.81 	 No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak-minded.
0.96 	 For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet.
0.81 	 Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though.
0.99 	 One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying.
0.96 	 Richard Harris plays Quint..
0.74 	 Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (don't ask).
0.99 	 Pretty amazing film-making here folks.
0.77 	 This is the only the second movie where I saw Verdone acting (the other was 'Un sacco bello'), and I can see why Italians find him tiresome, but he think he played his role well as the loving father.<br /><br />My one drawback with this movie was that I knew it took place in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I presume, but I felt like there was no representation of a place.
0.98 	 (Maybe I missed something?)
0.64 	 It's not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism.
0.99 	 I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something unchallenging for an evening.
0.99 	 This mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations.
0.74 	 SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" on the entertainment spectrum.
0.67 	 This movie is not art, but, like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort, and discipline to get it made.<br /><br />Overall, not a recommended use for your time, but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini-van.<br /><br />Oh, yeah...hey, IMDb!
0.54 	 "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling.
0.92 	 The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp, "what?"
0.93 	 If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums.
0.95 	 Sideways.
0.9 	 Junebug.
0.72 	 And so on.<br /><br />The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that Georgia Rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation.
1.0 	 If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) really was a dull guy.
0.87 	 I too, loved the title, but man I hated the stupid kid that played "Satan's little helper" I hated the mom too, and the sister/daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated all those people!
0.88 	 For those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated Chrysler 300C of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph.
0.55 	 Plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the Challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.
0.69 	 Well shot.
0.68 	 Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version.
0.64 	 I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job.<br /><br />This movie is not gory.
0.54 	 It's not very scary.
0.94 	 Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist.
0.82 	 Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as an waitress.
0.85 	 Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick.
0.84 	 Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 kids along to Venice for confrontation.
0.97 	 The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another.<br /><br />The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy.
0.92 	 The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell.
0.55 	 That is like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino, etc, etc.
0.98 	 It talked about Shin being from a Monastery in China - later identifying it from Bejing.
0.99 	 I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own, granted.
0.9 	 But its a distinct nation and it even labels "Mongolia" on the map.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, and yet she somehow feels connected to him.
0.51 	 Yey!
0.87 	 Brenda Song should get on with another studio.
0.99 	 The characters dare to ask questions like: What if something happened to Tarzan?
0.98 	 What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself?
0.94 	 The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him.
0.86 	 Especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you.
0.7 	 I always have to see it through to the end.
0.94 	 Do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining.
0.86 	 Especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you.
0.7 	 I always have to see it through to the end.
0.94 	 Do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry - far more entertaining.
0.98 	 But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.
0.77 	 That's not how it works.
0.52 	 But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have drama.
0.97 	 That said, there are also some well done battle scenes in the film.
0.58 	 Check it out on a rainy day and you'll be satisfied.
0.95 	 Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud).
0.5 	 Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest.
0.98 	 As for Elvis, he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point.
0.93 	 At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie.
0.59 	 And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view.
0.98 	 Okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since Fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say.
0.94 	 A little explanation would of been lovely.
0.6 	 Vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies.
0.98 	 This one was an exception.
0.94 	 Actually, there is one contrivance in the opening scenes, but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what's to come.
0.93 	 The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint, despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair.
0.62 	 The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score.<br /><br />Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home.
0.72 	 As "prosecutor" (a character that isn't given a name in the script), played by Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head.
0.92 	 He repeatedly makes remarks, "No one ever gets away with a thing like that," and "I can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us."
0.96 	 Indeed, after they are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime.
0.66 	 We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred.
0.63 	 The story is unrelenting, taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes.<br /><br />For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of the "Goofs" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated.
0.74 	 Such as the "reversed" process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas.
0.64 	 To begin with, this isn't even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real.
0.55 	 Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film (so not really spoiler after all).
0.62 	 It's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town.
0.5 	 It more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants.
0.58 	 She lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert.
0.89 	 We never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply.
0.73 	 She is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty.
0.86 	 The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times I saw a really wicked woman on film, who pretends to be anything but wicked - can't be compared with the witch in 'Snowwhite', who, in comparison is easy to find out.
1.0 	 True, he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films, but he added something to these films: real live theater gimmicks that you don't see anymore.
1.0 	 I remember loving this show when I was a kid.
0.99 	 I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen.
0.94 	 It was ultra high-tech for it's time.
0.53 	 Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era.<br /><br />Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider, except the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car.
1.0 	 I do, however, love the theme music.
0.99 	 It is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies.
0.51 	 We buy tickets not knowing what to expect.
0.99 	 As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas.
0.97 	 Andy Lau stars in another cop undercover tale.
1.0 	 Daniel Wu plays Nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang(Lau).
0.59 	 The movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces.
0.55 	 This movie's picture-perfect scenes look so real; it's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama.
0.56 	 Some men go crazy, some men cry, some men through fists, others do drugs, some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life, some try drink the pain away, some jump off buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse - physically.
0.73 	 I don't why Tigerland is heavily under-credited.
0.76 	 Home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town.
0.6 	 She seems to show no emotion about it.
0.96 	 Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital in order to graduate.
0.81 	 Meanwhile the police are investigating Alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen.
0.66 	 I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
0.67 	 Yet this is the case in this Hindi film.
0.83 	 As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place.
1.0 	 Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.
0.57 	 Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker.
0.86 	 The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around.
0.97 	 And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks!
0.97 	 (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.)
0.5 	 I give it an 8!
1.0 	 While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments.
0.89 	 I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway.
0.99 	 How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off?
0.75 	 Just get it.
0.99 	 There is no defending it, and no living without it.
0.63 	 How good/bad/strange/ is it?
0.66 	 Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS.
0.97 	 Parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out.
0.91 	 DANG..) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childish, strange..hey, what more can you want?
0.77 	 !.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Amateurish.
0.92 	 LET'S FILM THIS!
0.92 	 THIS MOVIE SUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS!!!!!!
0.51 	 !
0.81 	 Money grubbing, devious Japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman Pat Morita to recover industrial secrets in Detroit.
1.0 	 Here he encounters a down at heel Jay Leno, who promptly refers to a murder victim as a Jap and calls Morita Tojo.
0.53 	 But wait...there's more.
0.59 	 You will believe that the future looks... exactly like today.
0.77 	 This movie just starts off on the right track.
0.78 	 Crockzilla scene anyone?
0.53 	 I think i watched this movie, but don't quote me, as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it didn't exactly "grip my excitement and imagination."
0.58 	 It basically had NO worthwhile dramatic impact.
0.62 	 Zilch.
0.72 	 Comedy?
0.87 	 You can find something more interesting to do.
0.92 	 Try me for the sequence where Stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite.
0.7 	 I dunno, but he sure gives reality a run for the money.
0.75 	 She is a miracle of God's creation.<br /><br />Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress.
0.63 	 This is just about in the same league as `The Black Cat', although I'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+.
0.96 	 When you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to DVD it's that much more puzzling.<br /><br />Anyway, watch this film if you get the chance.
0.98 	 Imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 year's of his life, and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself!
0.84 	 When I think my job is stressful, I merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick.
0.96 	 The catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat.
0.87 	 One was the casting of Kowalkski.
0.98 	 I had no idea this was the case when watching it.
0.92 	 It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.<br /><br />I also found the story to be very absorbing.
0.97 	 I'm not one for action movies but I got sucked into this.
0.88 	 (I didn't even recognize Priestly.)
0.93 	 I am not sure how I feel about the ending.
0.86 	 The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though I'm highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.<br /><br />So I'd have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which I don't usually like but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie.
0.98 	 Admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?)
0.51 	 But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well.
1.0 	 (My big dislike is actually sequels.)
0.99 	 The darkness is from an evil sorcerer, who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world, and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures, the Yokhai, into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths.
0.74 	 The biggest danger with Miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end.
0.92 	 It owes a lot to cinema, as well as traditional Japanese folklore, but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats.
0.71 	 ), and Helena Bonham-Carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of MND, but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely.
0.71 	 In short, we believe him, just as much as we could NOT believe him as Frankenstein, as the priest in 'The Proposition', as the lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man', even as Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'.
0.54 	 "True" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods.
1.0 	 This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim.
0.65 	 Not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results.
0.57 	 Its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it.
0.54 	 Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told, "here watch this", which is what happened to me.
0.98 	 Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit.
0.74 	 This is a typical 70's soft core sex romp in the Russ Meyer genre, though perhaps less outlandish than some of Meyer's work.
0.69 	 This film has higher 'production values' than many of it's contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget.
0.84 	 Of late, this film has become a mainstay of B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the 500 channel universe.
0.98 	 If soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is as "good" as anything else in the B range.
0.72 	 Don't expect Polanski though, Sarno is just Sarno.
1.0 	 Jennifer Welles performance as the "mother" is perhaps the best of the cast.
0.51 	 It is watchable, if this is your type of film.
0.95 	 30 years ago, this would have been an avant garde and riske film.
0.97 	 You can see more or less the same kind of thing on Showtime/HBO series these days, and in prime time.
0.93 	 When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment."
1.0 	 Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity.
0.56 	 Hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing.
0.95 	 She's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest.
1.0 	 However, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes.
0.9 	 Oh well, I'll stick to NBC's "Today."
0.96 	 ABC's "Good Morning America" is also okay... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)
0.72 	 But this movie caught me off guard.
0.71 	 It wasn't what I was expecting at all.
0.96 	 It's been a while since I've seen it but I do remember I could not stop laughing!!!
0.95 	 And it wasn't just the cast that did it for me.
0.7 	 The script was amazingly written.
0.85 	 Every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen.
1.0 	 There were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious.
1.0 	 I really can't say anything bad about this movie!
0.71 	 Expcept, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more screen time!
1.0 	 ).<br /><br />Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour.
0.94 	 I've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time, this one however, takes the cake.
0.97 	 More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts the "c" in cheese-fest.
0.99 	 Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet.
0.95 	 Adam's father Alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game.
0.85 	 After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state.
0.7 	 1 out of 5 stars.
0.76 	 Than they work to together to save the Care Bears.
0.96 	 I can think of nothing else to say about it.
0.83 	 I mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that's about it.
0.67 	 The only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and I'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found.
0.88 	 And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything.
1.0 	 He does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character.
0.97 	 An outrageous man.
1.0 	 Yes, it's predictable.
0.98 	 But is it stupidly sentimental?
0.87 	 No.
0.8 	 I laughed.
0.71 	 Not a single moment of cheese.
0.99 	 "Wheel out the cripple!"
0.98 	 I watch it again again, and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must-see.
1.0 	 Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money.
0.88 	 Final Score...who cares - it's a reality show.
0.98 	 It doesn't bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show?<br /><br />I used to be a staunch supporter of Fox.
0.96 	 It's those of us like me who like and seek out quality TV that helped build Fox back in the days of Married...with Children and The Simpsons.
0.87 	 The very people who helped build them in the beginning.
0.98 	 Now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network.
0.61 	 It boggles the mind.
0.58 	 Nothing Fox, has done in the past 3 years makes any sense.
0.75 	 And the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like "Joe Millionaire".
0.92 	 They can now say "We don't need you TV fans, we have reality shows".
0.94 	 Here we have a premise, in the now classic Fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from "The Bachelor" or anything on the big 3.
0.6 	 Fox has gone mainstream.
0.84 	 The finale and "twist" (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve.
1.0 	 Come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves.
0.9 	 Demand a little bit more from your entertainment then THIS.<br /><br />Boycott FOX.
0.91 	 It's native people worship cats.
0.96 	 But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food.
0.99 	 It's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo.
0.61 	 How low can he go?
1.0 	 If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional.
0.96 	 Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.
0.98 	 I'll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in, but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece.
0.56 	 I think if you look back in eighty years, you would find today's movies will look just as racist.
0.8 	 Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money.
0.82 	 He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down.
0.74 	 To prevent that, she bought it.
0.89 	 Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away "their" money and decided to take action.
0.66 	 For those who never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film, this film is OK as movie musicals, nothing special, just OK.
0.91 	 A real theatrical audition, whether it be for a play or a musical, rarely takes more than five minutes.
0.91 	 If you're auditioning as a dancer, you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once, you do it, and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out.
0.99 	 Michael Bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little.
0.75 	 The play is about these dancers.
0.72 	 First of all, director Richard Attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the Cassie/Zach relationship and by casting Michael Douglas as Zach.
1.0 	 In the play, you NEVER see Zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with Cassie is barely touched upon.
1.0 	 The opening number in the play "I Hope I Get It" shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated.
1.0 	 "Goodbye 12, Goodbye 13, Hello Love", a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as "Surprise, Surprise" mainly a vehicle for the late Gregg Burge as Richie.
0.65 	 There are a couple of good dancers in the film, the previously mentioned Gregg Burge as Richie, Michelle Johnston as Bebe, and Janet Jones as Judy, but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do, yet Audrey Landers, who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, is given one of the show's best numbers, "Dance 10, Looks 3."
1.0 	 I will admit that the finale, "One" is dazzling, but you have to wait almost two hours for that.
0.93 	 I would say that if you never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage, this film might be worth a look, but if you are a devotee of the original Broadway musical...be afraid...be very afraid.
0.89 	 It's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool.
0.9 	 While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, boring, and doesn't go anywhere.
0.97 	 Where has the wit gone?
1.0 	 I am baffled.<br /><br />It is 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory.
0.51 	 !
0.91 	 The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents.
0.92 	 The movie does resort to a bit of a clichÃ© moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light.
1.0 	 When I saw this movie I heard all the hype, and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent.
0.85 	 I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won.
1.0 	 Sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture.
0.9 	 The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*SEMI-SPOILER*) hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor, but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever.
0.51 	 People left the movies worshipping this man, this hero, and they went out and bought his book, making this hero of a man rich.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit.
0.62 	 I do not like movies (especially Hollywood interpretations) that are based on "true" stories because they usually distort the "true" parts into something else, something not so true.
0.5 	 This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably.
0.81 	 Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man.
0.85 	 Not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people.
0.81 	 The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily, was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it.
1.0 	 The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their "nice and perfect" persona looked difficult to keep up.<br /><br />This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
0.8 	 This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time.
0.88 	 For one, it has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters.
0.93 	 On the other hand, Wayne's love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" of the early "Little Rascals" fame.
0.72 	 She is a grown-up 20-year-old now, blonde and cute as a button.
0.86 	 There's a scene in the general store, where she works, in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of "nerve tonic", which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf.
0.96 	 Wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935.
0.92 	 Anyway, it's an interesting little "B", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time.
0.99 	 This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film.
0.52 	 The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation.
0.96 	 The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs.
0.56 	 They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space.
0.97 	 Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform.
0.98 	 The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform.
0.95 	 This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time.
0.84 	 It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before.
1.0 	 Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it.
0.56 	 Could Pixar have not entered it?
1.0 	 I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.<br /><br />It's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show."
0.95 	 Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage.
0.95 	 The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.<br /><br />And as far as the plot goes.
1.0 	 And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe.
0.66 	 In the movie Roscoe is a little... scary.<br /><br />And who didn't have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard?<br /><br />Folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry.
0.94 	 It's just a great dumb movie!
0.99 	 Sure this movie wasn't like.
0.98 	 it's great, and not bad directing at all.<br /><br />for those who rate it a 1. they don't understand the film.
0.77 	 and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us.<br /><br />Ty.<br /><br />Victor
0.52 	 This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an indisputable error in its storytelling.
0.98 	 While handling the Ralphie situation Christopher states that he has heard about Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident.
0.69 	 This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie.
0.93 	 Hearing Christopher talk about Pie- O-My's death could therefore only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself has set the fire.
0.83 	 I understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable.<br /><br />With all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened.
0.58 	 It was like a comedy.
0.78 	 Anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that I'm pretty easy to please.
0.54 	 The film is like a punch in the face.
0.99 	 I probably would have loved it when I was 6.
0.82 	 Small things, like this being "The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy" despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made.
0.94 	 Okay, forget his wacky foreigner "Cousin Larry" schtick in Perfect Strangers, and look at him in True Romance.
0.69 	 There are those who claim Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent.
0.6 	 This cause is not helped here by Pinchot.
0.97 	 What is Stan?
0.56 	 Welsh?
1.0 	 <br /><br />Remember the originals with their split-second timing, intuitive teamwork and innate loveability?
0.6 	 that's mixed in with the boys' fraternity scenario.
0.72 	 I can't claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardy's 108 movies, but I think it's a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.<br /><br />Maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves, or at least using their own accents.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic.
0.79 	 <br /><br />Questions abound.
0.52 	 Why was this film made in the first place?
0.87 	 About as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage.
0.89 	 I almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.I thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked.
0.96 	 It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.The rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be.
0.99 	 The make-up was good and I have seen way worse movies then this one.
0.71 	 Unlike some other reviewers I found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture.
1.0 	 Carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing.
0.82 	 T and A all over the place (with a lot more T than A).
0.84 	 Who needs a story??!
0.9 	 Five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up.
0.51 	 Hmm..
0.97 	 In fact, I even stopped fast forwarding the commercials, as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature.
0.99 	 AND the ending is the ultimate cop-out.
0.88 	 I am not a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the "Halloween"s or "Friday the Thirteenth"s) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.5 	 Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident?
0.57 	 OOOOH!!!!
0.96 	 (From Borders, no less!)
0.7 	 The missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on Sci Fi channel are in the box set, but are tacked on the final DVD.
0.75 	 )<br /><br />S
1.0 	 It's just very poorly plotted and paced.
0.64 	 Follow the Fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers.
0.84 	 (some spoilers) - as if you wouldn't know how it'll end<br /><br />My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high.
0.89 	 A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility.
0.98 	 Every premise for a great movie was accomplished.
0.82 	 After the tests on animals succeeded, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself.
0.75 	 Once he's invisible, he changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen.
0.73 	 It suffers of the disease that many new movies have: the special effects.
0.98 	 From a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the movie.
1.0 	 I must admit, the fx are awesome, probably the best i have seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good.
0.99 	 Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only about spectacular scenes - and nothing more.
1.0 	 The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot.<br /><br />After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again.
0.99 	 In stead of a great film, HM is cr*p. There are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (i won't spoil this moment for you...)<br /><br />Okay, so what went wrong with the movie?
0.58 	 Everything.
0.63 	 Example: at the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab.
0.96 	 What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam.
0.69 	 <br /><br />Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)
0.97 	 Take your pick.
0.95 	 I might not be a huge admirer of the original "Creepshow", but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection!
0.55 	 And to think I was going into this expecting to like this one more.
0.98 	 Loosely linking the three tales (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia (80s) animation form.
1.0 	 I rather liked this segment and the wisecracking Creep character was a glowing light.
0.99 	 <br /><br /># The first story "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two elderly proprietors (George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour) of a general store in a dying native community, Dead River.
0.96 	 In front of the store is a wooden statue of an Indian Chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths.
0.96 	 What a nice touchy feely time.
0.94 	 These two factors really added to my headache.
0.94 	 When the Indian comes alive and turns avenger, the goons meet a very quick (though grisly) death in the proper fashion.
0.73 	 Quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too.
1.0 	 The surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it.
0.84 	 While, the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords.
0.91 	 Instead of checking or getting help, she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband.
0.95 	 The vivid make-up effects are well-displayed and dripping with vision.
0.97 	 Have a little courtesy for the dead darling.
0.92 	 It's an Andreas Schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be.
0.8 	 Which is cool, I guess.
1.0 	 A great opportunity for and Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom.
1.0 	 John Livien's suicida mother's hero was John Lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself.
1.0 	 Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed Lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a God instead a man.
0.88 	 I am a huge John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer , Mark David Chapman.
0.67 	 Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon.
0.59 	 Do we need to be reminded of that?
1.0 	 John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world.
1.0 	 Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory,by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John.
0.66 	 Please!
0.58 	 In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) wish-they-were-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength.?
0.8 	 However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him.
0.75 	 Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but these are super human strength people.
0.87 	 Oh and get this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine!
0.94 	 He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face.
0.89 	 It was pure madness.
0.69 	 Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end.
0.97 	 This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven.
0.99 	 Redemeption qualities?
0.6 	 Well I guess so, I will be fair in that aspect.
0.88 	 I think I feel the way that most people feel about Blood Rayne (and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures) about this film.
0.55 	 They had been busted, learned their lesson, gone straight, and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen.
0.51 	 They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivetÃ© about them that was quite appealing.
0.96 	 She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home.
1.0 	 For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together.
0.98 	 It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc.
0.9 	 There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix.
0.94 	 Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood.
0.73 	 It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job.
0.97 	 And while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived.
1.0 	 I assume no one took the time to rethink the script.
0.79 	 Hmm, Hip Hop music to a period western.
0.92 	 Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to keep track of.
0.86 	 "The sistahs are in tha house"!
0.93 	 ?French manicured nails on hard riding girls.
0.74 	 He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
0.99 	 However, the Israel film was a bit boring, and the Mexican guy, well, he should quit directing and work in a Mexican restaurant.
0.96 	 But other than that, the movie's a hoot.
0.96 	 I thought this movie would be dumb, but I really liked it.
0.85 	 Well, so what?
0.62 	 That was pretty tight.
0.59 	 The acting is like E-list and it's shown well in the movie.
0.82 	 The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny.
0.97 	 Anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated.
0.99 	 But, in every movie there is a downer.
0.96 	 In 'Brave New Girl', Holly wants so bad to get into Haverty Conservatory.
0.92 	 They are both in the music field, and they both have to sing at the ending of the semester.
0.99 	 The investigation and building of the case are handed over to the DA's office, where Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz are put in charge.<br /><br />Rumors about the case spread through Glen Ridge, an upper-middle-class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community.
0.6 	 (One of their fathers is a police lieutenant.)
0.87 	 Nobody believes Matarazzo.
0.61 	 The question is whether Sheedy and Stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial.
0.89 	 Matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff.
0.97 	 She's desperate for love and friendship, and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements.
0.96 	 Another student, a very popular girl in school, pulls a Linda Tripp on Matarazzo, pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident -- and taping the results!
0.77 	 Then it looks good again.
0.92 	 Eric Stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor.
0.88 	 I say that for the simple reason that he and I lived in Pago Pago around the same time.
0.72 	 (I hope he wasn't the kid I had that altercation with at the bar of the Seaside Club.
0.96 	 If he was, I take back my compliment.)
0.53 	 Ally Sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize.
0.61 	 The very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely, neotenous blond.
0.71 	 Instead, Matarazzo, without being at all ugly, looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up.
1.0 	 Nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle.
0.96 	 She has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to, which is all for the good.<br /><br />Matarazzo's character is the best drawn in the film.
0.98 	 Pure evil.
0.92 	 They deserve to get it in the neck -- and they do.<br /><br />I referred to this as a comic book story and that's pretty much what it is.
0.9 	 It challenges none of our prejudices.
0.96 	 It reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into Good and Evil.
1.0 	 A book full of strong Latino characters and they are represent, for the most part, by non-Latinos.
0.97 	 Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read!
0.51 	 If there were any flaws, I'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again.
0.64 	 Well, the violence is the best bit I'm afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their (entirely predictable) rampage.
0.62 	 And what on earth is the school film project all about?
1.0 	 How on earth they got the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light it I'll never know.
0.79 	 And how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery.
0.94 	 It wasn't weird to me.
0.97 	 And to me the movie was loooong.
0.93 	 I wonder if I ever saw the series and have confused them?
0.93 	 The flute was totally believable and I can still 'feel' the evil woods.
0.75 	 Witchy poo was scary - I wouldn't want to cross her path.
0.57 	 Are they solving a mystery?
0.53 	 Possibly, it's just hard to tell.
0.72 	 At the end of the movie, after a lot of radio signals are decoded (illegibly on some sort of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible.
0.92 	 Some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (I guess they don't like sharing the wealth).
0.67 	 and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film.
1.0 	 Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came along, there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the Hong Kong movie industry.
1.0 	 Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example.
0.58 	 He flips the coin over and over and again and again.
0.85 	 Who knows?
0.97 	 Sean Lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy.
1.0 	 All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng.
0.82 	 Who cares?
0.63 	 But if you're into old school wrestling (circa 1970's through the mid-80') then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer.
0.97 	 I gave it a two because I felt like being generous.
0.86 	 But their are others that don't want him to succeed.
0.76 	 A few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier.
0.99 	 Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all.
0.57 	 You gotta.
0.87 	 He has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script.
0.84 	 You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like Furlong is even acting.
0.62 	 Same with Madsen.
0.68 	 Does Madsen even have to act?
0.9 	 I battled if she was hot or not, but realized I would just like to see more of her.
0.87 	 <br /><br />Not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films.
0.99 	 Not glossed over a bit.
0.92 	 These guys are twins.<br /><br />As I watched I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town.
0.83 	 And some of them are smoking hot.
0.6 	 Need I say more.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Yes it's silly, yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious, but by gum - it's so much bloody fun!
1.0 	 Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining.
1.0 	 I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life.
0.93 	 Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences.
0.93 	 Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard.
0.51 	 H.B.
0.83 	 LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations.
1.0 	 Sol Polito's camera work is strong.
0.95 	 What more could I say?
0.78 	 But, the problem is Hak Hap(Black Mask) the movie was designed and meant to be dark, grim, super-disturbing and totally gruesome.
0.98 	 Yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child, but it works.
0.92 	 Her roundhouse kick was totally cool, even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting.
0.96 	 Did I mention she was also smoking hot?
0.71 	 Anyway, there are a lot of things to like about the movie.<br /><br />However, the movie also suffered from a lot of problems.
1.0 	 First off, it's a mediocre script made at its best potential, which means this production team deserved a better screen-writer.
1.0 	 There are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far-fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences(US version was even worse because all the character developments were cut).
0.96 	 Anyway, you can't ask too much out of a comic-inspired action movie.
0.99 	 Also, this movie is entirely improper for children.
0.93 	 I won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old.
0.83 	 It's saturated with disturbing contents including blood, gore, sado-maso costumes, extreme brutal violence and so on.
0.9 	 After coming to realization that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into Danny Wright (Kinnear).<br /><br />Danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him.
0.98 	 One is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble.
0.98 	 He could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him.
1.0 	 I wouldn't be averse to seeing an Oscar nod for this role.<br /><br />Consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line, "All blushy blushy... No sucky fucky".
0.98 	 Then get back to me" without coming across as unlikable.
0.96 	 Although there are a lot of familiar "television" names associated with "A Man Called Sledge", there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances.
1.0 	 In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's-70's television series like "The Rat Patrol" is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.
0.83 	 <br /><br />James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff"-"Gunfighter" etc.).
0.99 	 Fans of the slow-paced "Combat" television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski.
1.0 	 His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver.
0.53 	 The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison.
1.0 	 So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.<br /><br />I saw the original "Wicker Man" and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs.
0.99 	 For example, I liked the original 1950's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake.
0.97 	 Both films can stand on their own.
1.0 	 The original, as campy as it looks compared to today's standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell (my all time favorite horror movie).
1.0 	 The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion.
0.87 	 The threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female.
0.97 	 "), especially when Cage's character has bee allergies.
0.82 	 Physically dominate them.
0.91 	 They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community.
0.89 	 I belief LaBute should've left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island.
0.97 	 LaBute has said he created the fiancÃ© and daughter story thread to give Cage's character an incentive to search.
0.77 	 The whole third act was hilarious.
0.83 	 Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child.
0.91 	 Neil LaBute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort.
0.96 	 Stay with your own company of men.
0.99 	 Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers.
0.93 	 Here is your jar of honey.
0.79 	 I'll watch that.
0.99 	 Do you remenber those happy days in which video was a prosperous business, and a lot of movies were made with the only reason of filling the shelves of the video stores?
1.0 	 But boy, Video-age was a great age despite movies like this.
0.95 	 It's obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the innuendo in the script, the costumes,and the way they touch each other.
0.87 	 And bikinis before there were bikinis!
0.87 	 I don't understand the John Garfield issue though.
0.9 	 Does it matter whether or not he's in this film?
1.0 	 If he is, he screen is so short that he's basically a prop.
0.72 	 You need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's there.
0.99 	 The movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit.
0.97 	 The penalty however, I was disappointed in.
0.97 	 It was a side foot curl, rather than the appropriate laces blast.<br /><br />I am of course kidding.
0.61 	 How many more of those fake "slice of life" movies need to be made?
0.77 	 its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty-two minutes.
0.97 	 and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway?
0.7 	 The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.<br /><br />Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes, some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass.
0.79 	 Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film.
1.0 	 The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie, spitting the kidnappers through the windshield, went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to.
0.97 	 They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries.
1.0 	 During the end credits, there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless, but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely.<br /><br />The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director Chan.
1.0 	 There's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch.<br /><br />But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies, which is this comedy itself.
1.0 	 The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there, without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue.
0.99 	 I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare, and he is there to "murder" that girl.
1.0 	 This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre.
0.99 	 Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those "loud thoughts" are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and "light."
0.59 	 It is (I think) a story of a rebellious college basketball player, his tough-but-fair coach, his girlfriend, and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has continual nervous breakdowns.
0.81 	 I love this movie and never get tired of watching.
0.54 	 With rockers like Gene Simmons and Ozzy Osbourne you can't go wrong.
0.96 	 I prefer well thought and planed shows.
0.96 	 And I also confess, that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring...those love and drug stories...There are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense (Dallas e.g.
0.97 	 It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos.
0.98 	 After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate.
0.54 	 Wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail.
0.65 	 How about showing Dahmer's trial.
0.56 	 How about showing some more detail.
0.83 	 I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made.
0.96 	 This movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point?
0.56 	 The point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore.
0.97 	 This movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a women violently.
0.99 	 There are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore.
0.99 	 It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, you don't?"
0.99 	 I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why.
1.0 	 The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors.
0.8 	 Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials.
1.0 	 However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors.
0.85 	 But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.<br /><br />And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things.
0.9 	 It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies.
0.62 	 The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.<br /><br />I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.<br /><br />I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults.
0.61 	 Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H.
0.59 	 They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial.
0.76 	 And for all of those who ask, yes Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either.
0.68 	 And the songs are off the hook also.
0.86 	 I rarely get SCARED when watching films.
0.86 	 But I did get scared from Grudge.
0.98 	 Maybe because I didn't expect anything at all when I watched it.
0.97 	 I didn't expect getting scared.
0.99 	 I didn't know anything about it either.
0.67 	 Most people seem to compare it to the Japanese Grudge-films, but even though I haven't seen them, I believe it isn't right to compare any film, actually.
0.93 	 This film stands on it its own.<br /><br />The story is weak, most people say.
0.98 	 I don't agree.
0.98 	 Their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist Dr. Lorenz(Lugosi)and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife(Elizabeth Russell)needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young...forever beautiful.
0.99 	 An eager local cub reporter(Luana Walters)realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be most knowledgeable.
0.98 	 Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
0.99 	 This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time.
0.83 	 What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.?
1.0 	 She's hired, only to discover that Comet makes low-brow comedies, the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue.
0.96 	 This is especially notable during an interview sequence, when Miss Peppoire's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot-on impersonation of Swanson.
0.99 	 Writer/Director Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence, 8 Â½ Women.
0.72 	 The female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of.
0.87 	 There's the Kabuki-obsessed Mio, the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who's got a thing for farm animals.
0.71 	 But where the The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 Â½ Women just gets horny and exploitative.
0.74 	 It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood, analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of "primitive thought".
0.97 	 I have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie, from what I remember.<br /><br />I also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman.
0.98 	 Right, that's enough faint praise.
0.57 	 This could have been an a good movie.
0.88 	 I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt like Miike shot it for the sake of shooting it.
0.69 	 I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws".
0.66 	 Anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made.
0.88 	 That's cause enough for celebration.
0.89 	 To hammer the point home, the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of "1 Teenager In 10", the most popular coming out book of the time.
0.98 	 In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past.
0.84 	 I don't know if I agree with him yet.
0.9 	 SUrprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role.
0.84 	 I think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit Shakespeare.
0.89 	 I like it because I'm a HUGE fan of disaster films even though this is a family film.
0.78 	 Thats all i can think of.
0.81 	 Bonnie & Clyde kill two highway patrolman in Texas.
0.96 	 I got a huge kick out of this movie.
0.79 	 In my review for 'Ape Man,' I stomped on Jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she's redeemed herself for me here.
0.89 	 She's even got her own jungle scream now.
1.0 	 The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos.
0.97 	 Oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene.
0.99 	 All I can say is: yes, she is naked.
0.77 	 Just wow.
0.8 	 The inevitable sequel to Tarzan the Ape Man is a kick-ass, violent and risquÃ© jungle epic.
0.77 	 I doubt there will be another Tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does.
0.95 	 You'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be Code-approved, or Animal Rights-approved for that matter.
0.76 	 See it for yourself if you don't believe me.
0.9 	 In the first film, Jane seemed like a walking contradiction, like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that.
0.95 	 She totally has the ape man at her every beck and call.
0.77 	 **END SPOILER** One of things that still bothers me is Johnny Weissmuller's smooth, hairless bod and over-styled coif.
0.68 	 Other than that, this is pre-Code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed.<br /><br />Last film: It Happened One Night (1934).
0.94 	 I don't see how you can say that Freddy's Nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off.
0.95 	 If you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing.
0.94 	 This time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world.
0.99 	 This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling.
1.0 	 I have seen most, if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films.
0.97 	 One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90's setting.
0.92 	 But even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this film.
0.65 	 An example is the story, which revolves around one of the lead characters, a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang, whose only purpose is to randomly destroy SUV's.
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 Most of all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality.
0.99 	 Instead, we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.<br /><br />Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumbler, I suppose is the accurate description.
0.67 	 Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor defended in the action film sense) before Ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother, Donny.<br /><br />For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous.
0.64 	 We had to get it.
0.62 	 I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
0.95 	 The U.S. Government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster.
0.65 	 Yeah Ewoks were in there so what?
0.6 	 They're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts).
0.83 	 Palpatine is so evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him .
0.81 	 He seemed like an actual western character.
0.97 	 In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized.
0.98 	 Then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live TV.
1.0 	 Let me get the bad out of the way first, James Hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day.
0.83 	 It is a shame that they didn't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory, it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was.<br /><br />Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
0.9 	 From the beginning it is obvious that Jackie Chan's stunt team literally risked their live to make this film.
0.97 	 Even today, no movie has outdone police story in dangerous stunts.
0.76 	 While the comedy will provide a good number of laughs it does not always distract the audience from the lack of action.
0.75 	 And even in Hollywood the influences of this one film are not to be ignored.
1.0 	 I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur-productions.
0.98 	 And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to FulciÂ´s Classic "Zombi".<br /><br />So I leaned back and waited to be impressed.
0.8 	 Okay, some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but else thereÂ´s nothing.<br /><br />I didnÂ´t expect a new Romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value.
0.99 	 Add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner.
0.72 	 In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina?
1.0 	 How much is fidelity important in a relationship?
1.0 	 How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones?
0.98 	 Nothing is good for him.
0.79 	 He is not human, in some sense.
1.0 	 On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me.
1.0 	 a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer?
1.0 	 Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) I found the ending sort of trivial.
1.0 	 Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the "metropoly", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident.
0.91 	 But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed.
1.0 	 You don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) I hated the "stop the music in the restaurant" scene (which some comments praised a lot).
0.99 	 Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction?
0.91 	 Why Franz agrees with her?
0.54 	 The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality.
1.0 	 What's so special and unique about it?<br /><br />After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it a two).<br /><br />The "Naked women Photoshoot", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians.
0.92 	 Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots.
1.0 	 I found it quite original and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally "designed" in such a way that "Tomas types" are going to like it and "Tereza ones" are going to hate it.
0.71 	 If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.
0.92 	 Stunned, not by the film, but by some of the rave reviews I perused which influenced my watching it.
0.87 	 Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as I endured this movie.<br /><br />Justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer-addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite Mom's warnings that Dad is no good.
0.93 	 When a young woman is found murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments.
0.97 	 With the help of a couple pals, he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks.
1.0 	 As the truth begins to unravel, Justin uncovers an unexpected secret.<br /><br />One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT!
0.56 	 It would have been the film's potential saving grace.
0.99 	 Eric Conley played Justin very adeptly, I thought, and I wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future.
0.87 	 Indeed, I believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come.
0.78 	 There are a vast number of competently-made low budget films out there.
0.9 	 I can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised "Dark Chamber" here are in some way affiliated with its production.
0.99 	 I said that apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist he brings in, this movie is not worth watching, it is rather stupid.<br /><br />I have seen Eddie Murphy in several of movies and I thought that he was funny in those, I have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie, I also have not seen Eddie Murphy in the really "great" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash.
0.86 	 This movie is not a movie that I would really recommend that you see, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably are not going to like this, especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it!
0.89 	 On the whole, I come out of this movie knowing a few more things about Herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when I come in to the theater.
0.66 	 The gang is out of High School, so I believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did.
0.99 	 Eric wasn't in it, which ruined it.
0.95 	 Kelso wasn't in it for the most part either, which didn't help.
1.0 	 Pet Sematary , though a nice 80's Horror movie, with a nice Director and atmosphere, IS a copy of the Italian movie ZEDER by Pupi Avati.
0.64 	 you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy.<br /><br /> Is there something than this is worth watching for?
0.93 	 In elderly home, perhaps.<br /><br /> Anyway, the leading actresses has some sex-appeal and knows how to show it.
0.75 	 However, Pushing Daisies is my exception.
0.59 	 Wow!
0.97 	 First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid.
0.67 	 Jenny curiously asks Matt what was G-Girl like.
0.97 	 Reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it.
0.97 	 In the beginning her Jenny/ G-Girl is just plain weird.
0.94 	 Only toward the end does her Jenny become more sympathetic, instead of caricature.
0.99 	 What is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withÂBedlam or G-Girl?
1.0 	 One of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation).
0.89 	 So how does Matt break up with G-Girl?
0.9 	 Maybe not.
0.72 	 With all Uma Thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly.
0.8 	 And she does not get sufficient support from Reitman and Payne.
0.93 	 Thurman and Wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings.
0.87 	 Though given all involved, the movie could have been super.
0.78 	 Ok, first the good: Cher's performance and the cinematography.
0.99 	 Although I'm no Cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written.
0.98 	 It was quite surreal.
0.72 	 And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances.
1.0 	 Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and frankly I've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided.
0.92 	 This movie is about a cop (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super-clever thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a Kelly Lin.
0.73 	 This movie, covered by handsome lead actors, beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes, really has no substance at all.
0.51 	 6/10
0.99 	 Featured are: Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals, and of course,the Beatles.<br /><br />It is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts.
0.99 	 the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like Zelah Clarke.
0.99 	 i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid.
0.85 	 in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character.
0.98 	 i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her.
1.0 	 i think they made a bad choice in casting her.
0.57 	 another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film.
0.89 	 <br /><br />Incredible visual effects..
0.98 	 Very good acting, especially from Shue.
0.75 	 Everything is perfect..
0.51 	 Except..
0.93 	 This is all his supposedly "genius" mind could think of.
0.79 	 Does he try to gain extra power?
0.93 	 "<br /><br />If you read the actual book, while the Scientist (Cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character.
0.68 	 In the movie, Cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it.
0.69 	 but for whatever reason, everybody seemed really into the comedy of it.
0.88 	 I remember thinking at one point, "That would have been funny in the early sixties."
0.94 	 In many instances, the throw-aways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line.<br /><br />Thematically, Woody was traipsing familiar ground.
0.92 	 Since we are all in on the joke, we can't help but laugh.
0.8 	 But the laughs don't come from recognizing the Woody nebbish, but truly from the character.
0.57 	 What about Ian (Swearengen) McShane?
0.89 	 )<br /><br />So what did I think?
0.93 	 Less caustic than Deconstructing Harry.
1.0 	 Were they trying to imitate the wonderful film "Crash?"
0.59 	 One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor.
0.9 	 Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive.
0.92 	 I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between.
1.0 	 Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare.
0.97 	 Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts.
0.59 	 The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven.
0.99 	 None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here.
0.98 	 For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 4/10
0.99 	 AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out her best scenes.
0.71 	 She is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in "Get Carter", but she handles the sub-plot better in "Get Carter".
0.96 	 (It's the scene were Ryan Philippe's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin's charactor, at least I think it's a homage to Hitchcock.
0.9 	 The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out.
0.93 	 Let's get some things straight first: Zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them WALK, RUN, hell even FLY if he wants to.
0.99 	 Everything they did was so damn original.
0.8 	 I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fan boys expect everything like Romero.
0.99 	 Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie, once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants.
0.82 	 The zombies in this movie all look very good but OBVIOUSLY they are not decaying corpses since they JUST freaking died!
1.0 	 They are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood.
0.85 	 It looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it.
0.61 	 10 out of 10!
1.0 	 First of all, I think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this.
1.0 	 Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is the new woman at Millennium Investments, a high scale brokerage firm, who starts getting helpful hints from wide-eyed secretary Deidre (Sheila Kelley).
0.87 	 Remade today, this film would be a very creepy, very disturbing dark comedy.
0.65 	 And I still do today!
0.51 	 It has a grim storyline, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf--a very emotional scene--and wants to become a wolf, like him.
0.97 	 After years of training, the lamb is made into a really REALLY evil looking thing.
0.95 	 He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he cannot kill the lambs, no matter how much he wishes to.
0.89 	 I couldn't help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, on the basis of Z (the Lambrakis assassination) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
0.99 	 The music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard.
0.52 	 i like the brother and sister in this movie.
0.76 	 They both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like "My friends are going to be so jealous!"
1.0 	 My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe.
0.95 	 If you are looking for classic horror, go and dig up a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat).<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality well written and acted film, you will need to change trains.....
0.99 	 A solid, if unremarkable film.
0.72 	 I got a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature.
0.7 	 But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes an "ass-" out of "u-" and "me."
0.98 	 I had read before viewing that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress Love.
0.51 	 Rip-off.
0.55 	 I think that I thought this was BII because this has a similar title to one of BII's alternate titles.
0.86 	 Who does this guy Ulli Whatever think he is?
0.93 	 Does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms.
1.0 	 "The Crush" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit "Sex and the City".
1.0 	 <br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of).
0.99 	 Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl!
0.99 	 I love off color comedy.
0.92 	 It's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat.....by Batman...A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat.
0.77 	 Hilarious.
0.95 	 Simply genius.
0.96 	 You never would have guessed it was made in 1983.
0.96 	 It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one.
0.94 	 But to be honest it doesn't matter.
0.93 	 Now we know,he made this movie.
0.98 	 There is so much happening on the screen,you simply won't believe!
0.91 	 I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in Holland.
0.86 	 Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas!
0.84 	 This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like "Superman Returns" or Xmen 3.
0.98 	 The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humor!
0.9 	 Somehow it is missing in this movie.
0.7 	 Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters.
0.97 	 I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie.
0.99 	 It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long.
0.76 	 Jim Carrey needs meds!
0.88 	 When they killed off John Amos's character they killed the show.
0.9 	 He was the vital part of the info structure.
1.0 	 You had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how.
0.94 	 <br /><br />James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children.
0.82 	 Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it.
0.99 	 The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit.
0.88 	 Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family.
1.0 	 Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program.
0.96 	 James dies and JJ took over the show.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show.
0.95 	 We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment.
0.93 	 I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real.
0.98 	 It's OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs.
0.66 	 Michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan's show.
0.51 	 Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams?
0.98 	 I'll tell you why, it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams.
0.72 	 They should have kept James.
0.98 	 The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical innacuracies are not.
0.91 	 I do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it.<br /><br />Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation, which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph, in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on google.
0.63 	 Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro.
1.0 	 Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he's forced to Vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting.
0.91 	 You can see in Giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film.
1.0 	 Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film.
0.97 	 I just wanna say: Mr. Flocker, you've done a good job!
0.99 	 And for all you Hollywood producers out there; If you want to remake a movie, remake this one!
1.0 	 Irwin Allen was great.
0.99 	 All of his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode.
0.8 	 A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were rip offs of his older TV shows.
0.9 	 One episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation.
0.99 	 Irwin lost his touch with TV shows after the 60s.
0.99 	 The acting is strong with Martin Milner.
0.95 	 Child stars got there starts with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt.
0.88 	 I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time.
0.83 	 Must have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot direct to videotape.
0.95 	 The production values make _Blair Witch_ look professional.
0.66 	 The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.
0.93 	 The short they did with the same title has more laughs.
0.59 	 Each movement and nuance of her performance, makes any other Bollywood heroine pale into significance.
0.98 	 In 1990 Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis did a TV Too Young To Die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in Kalifornia.
0.51 	 Pitt is the walking definition of an inbred Gothic refugee from Deliverance.
0.99 	 Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life.
0.76 	 <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else.
0.99 	 This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S.
0.96 	 Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday.
0.99 	 I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?.....
0.51 	 hee-hee.
0.98 	 This may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show...But I remembered this as being live-action.
0.91 	 I remember it very clearly.
0.9 	 That is all I remember.
0.93 	 The noose was accurate ( as for as I could tell), but that type of noose broke the person's neck.
0.65 	 Going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens.
0.98 	 The oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O!
0.98 	 He begins to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes).
0.99 	 Then, thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over, he visits the wife (Kari Wuhrer) of the man who he killed and wins her affections.
0.94 	 Soon after she discovers who he is, tragedy strikes, and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their previous "kindness".<br /><br />I got to ask though, what is it with Kari Wuhrer and horror/gore type films?<br /><br />It seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre.
0.75 	 Granted, I liked her in "Eight-Legged Freaks" and she was okay in "Anaconda".
0.98 	 But despite all her obvious cuteness and allure (wow, she's hot!
0.87 	 ), she can act much better and chose better roles.
0.75 	 For all you guys out there, you get to see the "fully monty" of her in this film, although it's rather bizarre and short-lived.
0.89 	 Just don't expect much of it from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems forever destined to second his brother Alex's.
0.99 	 The film did bring out a few old greats though, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science).
1.0 	 Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job in playing the main character, Sean Crawley.
0.91 	 His little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth, bring some elements of substance to the film.
0.94 	 Really... Are you forgetting that Cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment?
0.91 	 Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna ZacarÃ­as as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down.
0.97 	 Unfortunately this movie was not mass produced, and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it.
0.53 	 Once the bet is on, though, the movie picks up the pace as it's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm.
0.87 	 She was also in "Paulie", that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home.<br /><br />Ms.
0.55 	 than Haley Joel Osment, another three named kid actor, but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment has been in lately.<br /><br />Anywhozitz, according to my 8 y.o.
1.0 	 The ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels (How to Eat Boiled Slugs?
1.0 	 ), which might not be such a bad thing.
1.0 	 Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons.
0.59 	 While he has one particular goofy scene, he ruled the school with a firm hand.
0.65 	 About 1986 I saw this movie by accident on TV one night.
0.62 	 I was 6 years old.
0.95 	 It was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to Don't Look Now in 1987.
0.93 	 I went to Venice on holiday the next year in silent terror, hoping to god that my parents wouldn't find out I'd watched it!
0.71 	 <br /><br />Would I have minded if my parents knew I'd watched Les Valseuses when I was a kid?
0.57 	 I'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays, and my mum's probably disapproving in the afterlife.
0.98 	 I don't know if they'd want to see it anyway.
1.0 	 From the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes I'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself.
0.98 	 Even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation.
0.97 	 Do they suck her breasts for her own good?
0.79 	 That is exploitation.
0.68 	 So why am I getting a woody?<br /><br />The fellows go in search of an experienced older woman, find an ex-con, mother-figure?
0.84 	 I don't know.
0.51 	 Mutilation of where the boys began.
0.87 	 Why do they shoot the girl in the leg?
0.6 	 Do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men?<br /><br />I'm thinking of two movies, one of which I wish I'd never seen, the other makes me wish it wasn't such a harsh world.
1.0 	 Swept Away/Madonna what a pile of insanity doesn't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation!
0.75 	 Now they are both destroyed.
1.0 	 Very honest, no titillation.
0.76 	 Jokes, yes.
0.98 	 Les Valseuses isn't a rape movie!
0.75 	 God nobody's going to want to watch it now!
0.59 	 It's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much.
1.0 	 They've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels.
0.83 	 In some respects it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" but it's an altogether tougher piece of work.
0.97 	 If the film strikes a false note it is, perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way round) and even messier life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless.
0.87 	 In the 80's video nasties, gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say.
0.98 	 STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other.
0.97 	 A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it.
0.67 	 So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?)
0.56 	 <br /><br />This isn't a Flight of Fury.
0.95 	 It isn't even a flight of fun.
0.61 	 *
0.56 	 7 out of 10.
0.94 	 Animals like say, a certain rabbit.
1.0 	 I loved this man's films and kept thinking "Buster, how could you?!".
0.93 	 Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this god-awful episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.
0.95 	 He'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well.
0.71 	 Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay--appearing in Beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserved much better.
0.51 	 !
0.84 	 Things are idyllic for a time but, predictably, it goes sour.
1.0 	 (Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand?
0.92 	 The downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received.
0.66 	 (B)
0.99 	 When this movie came out I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore was anticipating what I thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it did not have the restrictions the TV improv shows must deal with.
0.77 	 The stun gun advertisement was suitable humor for Seasame Street.
0.64 	 Oh yea I've read the comments about the entire country being stoned in the 1970's and you will like this movie if you are high.
0.96 	 Well, any "institution" that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as "Titanic" shouldn't be taken seriously.<br /><br />On with the review.
0.98 	 He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas.
0.94 	 The movie has relatively few problems for families and I don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater.
0.85 	 or any fan of the books.
0.97 	 You will not be disappointed.
0.98 	 Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie!
0.54 	 If you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings,go for this one!
0.93 	 I could watch this over and over, and I often do!
0.66 	 Funny.
0.97 	 Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message, albeit on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so (and that's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back again, thank you very much!!).
0.91 	 It's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually I've known better fourteen-year-olds...), except maybe for Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough.
0.99 	 I'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences.
0.93 	 After all, here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives (namely their respective fiancÃ©es), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there.<br /><br />
0.78 	 Michael Curtiz directed this 1930 very-stylish whodunit from a script by Robert Presnell Sr., Robert N. Lee and Peter Mine.
0.98 	 The characters are unarguably unusually well-realized, the direction rather good and unusually swift-paced; and except for a darkish B/W look, the film avoids the comedic asides, superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries.
0.99 	 The music by Berhard Kaun is serviceable; Orry-Kelly did the costumes.
0.88 	 The story breaks into four parts.
0.72 	 Enter Vance, to find out who did in Archer Coe in a locked room and how, with the help of Palette; the romantic difficulties are straightened out, the Chinese servant is exonerated, we find out who broke the expensive vase, who will marry whom, how Archer Coe was done in and why the butler did not do it--but someone else with a good excuse did.
0.97 	 would not like us to see this movie, because they have a beef with the Iranian govt.
0.68 	 The ensuing comedy is too funny to describe, from the bus trip to the stadium, to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls, to the resulting end.
0.8 	 I know a lot of those.
0.98 	 The guys that'll watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror.
0.79 	 Not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed.
0.95 	 A group of college teens after finals (in the fall?)
0.97 	 In another scene, Rider Strong from "Boy Meets World" gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says "Pancakes" and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him.
0.75 	 If you can figure out the reason for why the "Pancakes" kid was included, I'd love to know.
0.93 	 Another kid likes to drop F-bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels.
0.77 	 Your guess is as good as mine!<br /><br />Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie.
0.99 	 The only part that I sort of liked was Rider's scary story (although gory) about the deranged bowling alley guy.
1.0 	 In interviews, Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth.
0.75 	 Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning?
0.52 	 Actually, Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1!
0.66 	 Murders are occurring in a Texas desert town.
0.73 	 This is a fan-made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs Batman and Superman!
0.61 	 <br /><br />But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafÃ©s.<br /><br />The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once.<br /><br />(originally written 12/8/2001)
0.52 	 The movie has one or two nice moments, but thats it and having those two small good moments, doesn't make up for anything in between, before or after those moments.
0.99 	 Believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing.
0.92 	 Very hit and miss.<br /><br />No one can really act in the film.
0.81 	 If you aren't a fan it'll make you one.
0.65 	 Warning: contains a spoiler.
1.0 	 Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.
0.93 	 Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place.
0.87 	 As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling "feet foremost through the floor into an empty space."
1.0 	 I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's, but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time.
0.98 	 So naturally, I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored."
0.97 	 Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking, chain-smoking, drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona).
0.89 	 And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple.
0.96 	 They take it to the "Jerry" show.
0.93 	 The characters collide.
0.51 	 Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!!
0.93 	 Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie!
0.74 	 With seldom laughs.
0.99 	 <br /><br />My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene.
0.67 	 In the words of Charles Dance's character in this film, "Bollocks!"
0.94 	 Full of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?).
0.79 	 Direct to video?
0.6 	 However, these monsters are allergic to cat's scratches...
0.95 	 I have never been fan of sleazy, overrated bestsellerists like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr Dung himself, is actually not near as bad than it could be.
1.0 	 Of course, the film is polluted by Mr Dung's potty-mouthed dialogue and all-tactics-of-toilet-seat obsession to vilify fat people, leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher, but there is roses among manure.
0.79 	 That's why they were successful.
0.91 	 The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film.
0.59 	 Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock.
0.78 	 I respect Alex Cox the filmmaker, I really do.
0.97 	 He's like the kid at school who you think at first is just trying a little too hard to be "different", a literary punk-rocker who has dipped more than his feet into spaghetti westerns and science fiction and fringe-culture and come out into the world ready to take s*** on... but then you see what he can actually do, the talent and raw feverish artistry and moments of true absurd hilarity capable of him, and you are ready to see whatever he has to offer.
0.95 	 We follow Lonnrot on his case, and his methods of going after the perp, which include following at first a triangular and then compass-shaped pattern on the map- this despite the protests of the flabbergasted Commissioner Treviranus (Miguel Sandoval), who also looks back in flash-forwards sitting at a desk and speaking to the audience in garbled but sad descriptions of his former employee and colleague after the fact of the case.<br /><br />Oh, Cox has his moments of creativity and interest, such as a shot where we see the entire scope of the harrowing depths of the police station where Eccleston's character is taken in by handcuffs ("For his own protection" says Lonnrot in case of getting lost in the wrong room) and we're followed in a long tracking shot- maybe the best or just most curious- where we're taken through very dark hallways with very little direction, lost in the maze of turns and oddities among the characters.
0.99 	 And it's never something that isn't fascinating to *look* at, with Miguel Garzon's cinematography a morbid delight.
0.9 	 What's the conflict here?
0.69 	 I was never that much engaged with Boyle's own personal mission to find this killer, and only mildly caught up in the few flashes of deranged scenes of the killer (and/or killers) going after people like in the building early on (Cox himself has an amusing cameo).
0.94 	 And just when I started to think it was leading up to something spectacular, with Boyle and Eccleston in that big ("not as big as you think") building in the South section of the city, it suddenly gives us a "TWIST" that we know in the back of our minds is coming but hope isn't, and it deflates any of the humdrum mystery it's been leading up to.
0.97 	 For all of Cox's uncanny touches as a filmmaker, for all of his opposition to spoon-feeding the audience with a 'conventional' approach, which I do respect, Death and the Compass ultimately cuts one off at the brain-stem; it's masturbatory.
0.95 	 He was a bastion of hope for the little man.
0.51 	 Instead of a creepy demon gladiator, as the cover implies, we're treated to a dude wearing the latest in Wal-Mart Halloween apparel.
0.94 	 A perfect example of making a buck, rather than making a quality film.
0.59 	 The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop.
0.94 	 And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)!
0.72 	 When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna.
0.96 	 They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact.
0.99 	 Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile.
0.63 	 What a moving film.
0.94 	 Being in my late 40s I am beginning to see what she has been complaining about.
0.94 	 When May says "...this lump of a body..." wow.
0.88 	 A family that she didn't really want, but was "something you just did when she was young".
0.55 	 The scene where he is pleasuring May and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman, and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her.
0.88 	 Bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure...two completely different men.<br /><br />Alas...I wonder where is my Darren?
0.99 	 It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored.
0.82 	 I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze.
0.68 	 It's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us.
0.99 	 Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film, this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism.<br /><br />Stefan (Tom Wlaschiha) journeys from Berlin to San Francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused.
1.0 	 Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place, each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from Puccini's opera 'Turandot' which just happens to be opening at the San Francisco Opera.
0.67 	 A police investigator Louise Tolliver (Irit Levi) and her companion cop (Kalene Parker) follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory.
0.72 	 He encounters a strange lad Jeffrey (Jim Thalman) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor Burroughs (Richard Conti) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects.
0.95 	 How this all come to an end is the play of the film, a story as much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders.<br /><br />While Tom Wlaschiha, Jim Thalman and Richard Conti do well with their roles (they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film!
0.93 	 Grady Harp, February 06
0.8 	 WARNING!!!
0.95 	 OR YOU CAN, WHATEVER.<br /><br />They're are few words to describe a movie that claims to be the last and comes out with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe even some words that can't be uttered.
0.83 	 But When Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone who thought the series got old, and wanted to stop seeing him, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) just stops for his final breath, This film was it.<br /><br />This film starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz, Then you see a kid who is named only as John Doe, Who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, leaves and gets out of Freddy territory.
0.9 	 This film will either make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more.
0.68 	 Okay, I'm not going to critique this film in depth.
0.54 	 But each time I see that DVD on my shelf, I sense an inner groan.
1.0 	 But for other cinephiles like me - beware.<br /><br />Expressed in simplest and gentlest terms, here's my stance:<br /><br />The political turmoil and overthrow providing the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life - via newspapers I read daily in my local middle-European pub.
0.64 	 At that time, I followed the newsreports, but never fully grasped what the heck was transpiring.
0.99 	 Those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the U.S., all of whose issues I understand clearly at the time - but dictatorship or not, my papers tended to treat the govermentment of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as a well-fleshed out "evil empire", to use flippant Star War terms.<br /><br />So, week after week, I read of disturbances, but never found an intelligent editorial that might provide the history behind them, or evaluate the practices and social-economic impacts of the dictatorship, etc.<br /><br />So, in purchasing this film, I had at least two hopes: to finally understand the details leading up to the social unrest, and to enjoy a well-conceived drama.
1.0 	 This film gave me neither.<br /><br />The film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts.
0.96 	 The box shows smiling clean-shaven actors, the lead giving the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny.
0.81 	 After seeing the work, I wondered what the French could have thought of it - though as a shallow piece of "cinema verite'" with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its "honesty" but...<br /><br />Look at the back of the box: "Un regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm regard?
0.97 	 Try describing Allende's overthrown and murder with a a "warm regard"!
0.99 	 Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968!
0.94 	 Try it with the whole line-up of overthrows, and civil rebellions!<br /><br />Another review: Maria de Medeiros a renoue' avec son pays, son enfance et son histoire."
1.0 	 At least for me.<br /><br />I love Portugal.
1.0 	 In all of Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities.
0.61 	 <br /><br />Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it.
0.94 	 But look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver.
0.57 	 What's any more real than that?
0.72 	 I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen.
0.55 	 I thought it was cute.
0.79 	 Billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day.
0.91 	 If he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants.
0.99 	 The beginning of the movie is set up to show that Billy has a VERY weak stomach and pukes at almost anything.
0.55 	 However, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she reads about in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding.
0.85 	 ), but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending.
0.69 	 Expected Messing sequel: Divorce Date.
0.97 	 Charming and sweet, but with no purpose.
0.98 	 The "romance" with John was completely unbelievable.
0.91 	 Whats not to like?
0.61 	 11 out of 10
0.96 	 No exaggeration - that's the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor.
1.0 	 If you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance.
0.87 	 Did they watch the film with their eyes closed?
1.0 	 Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision".
0.53 	 Get used to it.
0.76 	 Deal with it.
0.96 	 Age gracefully damnit.<br /><br />The Winds Of War could have been... so good.
0.99 	 Right now, with the constant haggard old biddy distraction, that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.
0.83 	 Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies, who seem to only know the recent blockbusters.
0.99 	 Dick Tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated, in terms of technology.<br /><br />The negative reviews mainly complained about DT's "messed up" story.
0.93 	 But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear, and I had no problem following it.
0.99 	 I had some scratches on my head, and can't help but wonder, did we really see the same movie?
0.98 	 And many thanks to make-ups.<br /><br />To me it's not bad at all.
1.0 	 Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies.
0.97 	 They get to be same ol'-same ol'.
0.98 	 For instance, I saw both of the recent Mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second.
0.99 	 After flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television I stopped to watch it.
0.96 	 This movie almost has the feel of a 'Masterpiece Theater' production.
0.99 	 But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility.
0.97 	 The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable.
0.95 	 Hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc.
1.0 	 Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.<br /><br />The woman only makes about five appearances in the film.
0.88 	 If she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set.
0.83 	 I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and a zillion more.
0.9 	 I haven't seen anything that tops 'The Woman in Black' yet although I'm still looking.
0.96 	 I joke to people that I occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that I'd see her staring through my window, etc.
0.89 	 Maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate.
0.87 	 I just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie.
0.98 	 Many critics have felt offended that R.W.
0.97 	 Concretely speaking: Starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state, the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do, and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation, so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender.
0.93 	 In a synthetic viewpoint, the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness.
0.66 	 They are mutually related.
0.67 	 From Fassbinder's dialectic viewpoint, it follows that neither Lili Marleen nor Lola nor Maria Braun can be condemned for their "misuse" of the ruling system for their private purposes, because they don't misuse them, they just use them.
0.62 	 In the opposite, since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims, because "good" and "bad" are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two-valued logic, their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world, that is not black and white at all, much better than a black-and-white logic.
0.85 	 Everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail, particularly our protagonist.
0.85 	 One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body.
0.66 	 Nothing else needs to be said.
0.73 	 The fact that he couldn't sing added to his character.
0.94 	 I have even enjoyed his one-act TV movies, like "The Dumb Waiter" and "The Laundromat".
0.63 	 He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies.
0.85 	 I did not know there were so many people who thought like Leonard Maltin, who does not like Altman at all.
0.72 	 In this case, one may dislike "The Gingerbread Man", but for me the reason has more to do with Grisham than with the director-screenwriter.
0.53 	 I think he was applying a bit of Brecht, distancing us, preparing us for the third act, which is plain Hollywood pastiche.
0.99 	 I was not disappointed a bit with the movie.
0.95 	 If I give it a nine instead of 10, it is because of Grisham.
1.0 	 So why complain?
0.98 	 For me, these persons saw another movie... And vice versa.
1.0 	 ...when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950).
0.98 	 Sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead, right after STATE OF THE UNION (1948).
0.98 	 It is directed brilliantly, there is obviously a lot of money in it.
1.0 	 Gere and Danes are intense (although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up), editing and cinematography are excellent.
0.99 	 Unless I'm sadly mistaken, I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video, I'm pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors, at the end of it, and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
0.92 	 It's amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now, but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos.
0.51 	 The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2, with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands.
0.76 	 <br /><br />`Larry' Fishburne, tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles, was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice-guy orderly, stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little.
0.98 	 Not surprisingly, he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie.
0.93 	 Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor, but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film.
1.0 	 Eventually, they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it's not just some kind of group hysteria.<br /><br />Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson, this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger.
0.63 	 Not surprisingly, she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients, since she had experienced exactly what they're going through.
0.94 	 There are some interesting murders in this installment, and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump.
0.94 	 Ouch.<br /><br />We get a peek into Freddy's past in this installment.
1.0 	 In fighting Freddy, the patients all band together and, in their dreams, use their special powers (most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life) to fight him.
0.58 	 One student, bound to a wheelchair, is able to walk in his dreams, another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the `Wizard Master,' another is `beautiful and bad' (she has lots of makeup, her hair stands up in a foot-high Mohawk, and she has knives).
1.0 	 Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast, displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career, and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two Â a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films.
0.97 	 The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension, which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we've come to know and root for their triumph over evil.
0.85 	 But then again, not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed, or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives.
0.95 	 But it's important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones
0.98 	 Arthur Mathews' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era's icons - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the infamous 'Oz' obscenity trial of the early '70's.
0.97 	 Its a shame that there was never a second series, possibly because of people like me.
0.88 	 If you missed 'Hippies', give it a try.
0.52 	 It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.<br /><br />It's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms.
0.99 	 To say much more would be to ruin the movie, so I'll kindly shut up.
0.68 	 And that would be a crime.<br /><br />As in most anime movies, I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous.
0.94 	 Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past.
0.66 	 Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.<br /><br />The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police.
0.97 	 The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off.
0.6 	 Or does it?
0.83 	 The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things.
0.99 	 A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone.
0.69 	 They aren't his target.
0.93 	 The children are not the only ones looking for this island.
0.72 	 Another sequel?
0.85 	 STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike-team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above.
0.53 	 I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (perhaps not Steveday!)
0.99 	 The plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called Harvester that went on.
0.51 	 Also as another reviewer noted, the film has a nice Gothic look to it, a new touch for a Seagal film.<br /><br />The absolute killer low point, though, was the complete and total lack of any exciting action, with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun.<br /><br />I have to be honest, though, I would rather watch this again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill.
1.0 	 Though a remake, the former (shot in Technicolor) remains the superior effort; that said, apart from some resistible comic relief, the obligatory resort to cheap gimmickry (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag which supposedly turned up at some police station containing a severed head?
0.99 	 It conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers.
0.96 	 One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job.
0.98 	 The IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes.
1.0 	 I have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many IMDb users (Some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever.'
0.64 	 What??
0.99 	 My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on.
0.7 	 Duh!
0.94 	 What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie?
0.89 	 Of course not!
0.97 	 get slaughtered.
0.58 	 Most of Li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to Black Mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence, bloodshed, or action sequences whatsoever!
1.0 	 Maybe it thinks it is profound.
0.66 	 It's neither challenging nor confrontational, though I'm sure the film-makers consider themselves very 'daring', just deeply unpleasant.<br /><br />Is this as high as we can aim?
0.62 	 Oh the customs!
0.95 	 )<br /><br />Where is the lofty aspiration?
0.92 	 The noble impulse?
0.98 	 When you look at British film - the joyful comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man (a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation look at "The Offence' Dir.
0.98 	 It's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future.
0.83 	 It's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here, but it's everyone's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead.
1.0 	 SEEMS LIKE FEAR PROMOTION IS HOLLYWOOD'S NORM THIS DAYS, especially when coming to thrillers which is the most "on demand" motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so = most viewed, best way to try influence the society as a whole.
0.99 	 such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and "ethical" people, that it gives a new much needed meaning to "anti-heroes" figures.
0.81 	 the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist(for sure a "cliche" at least) ( in real life someone would probably get a beating for it, you will see what i mean).
0.99 	 the second scene ( with Claire Danes's character present) is even more extreme.
0.97 	 at that point i realized, in my opinion that Erroll Babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him.how many people, that have seen or will see this movie, have never been "hold down"(regarding BOTH sexes) out of self, COMMON gratification!
0.96 	 ?.typically the movie gives an extreme CRIMINAL case(that unfortunately did, is and will likely happen again sometime , somewhere) BUT fingers everyone else indirectly as well as "you could become that", etc.
0.95 	 anyone that is familiar with Sigmund Freud and Jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone "asses" , by such fanatical "hero" here.
0.54 	 SAFE sex in its many forms IS healthy and not some evil that apparently Richard Gere character is obsessed with , on his way for some sexual "crusade".
0.9 	 have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys!?
0.6 	 or for how long an American teenager can see extreme violence on "pg-13" but he can not even see a woman breast until "R-18"!?!?
0.97 	 all sexual activities(upon MUTUAL acceptance) integrates individuals better then some "rightous" nut-case, THAT blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on "the lives of others"( a new German movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject).here, like in that movie, you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been.<br /><br />i am very disappointed with Richard Gere especially after the recent " hunting party", a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic "hero"( after real facts as well).but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone's political and social agenda.
0.82 	 "the flock" and "untraceable" 2 heads of the same hidden beast)))it just reminds you, if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a WHOLE, as Erroll Babbage has those here, to stay clear of them for THEIR own safety.they would kill my family faster then any 0.00001 chances of Paul Jerrod in anyone's life would...<br /><br />in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about MY "assesment" of this particular movie ( and "untraceable" actually), so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did.
0.67 	 ))))for once i agree with the rating, this is not a feature for teenagers or kids; simply because at best would confuse them even more then the "common" belief of "money+fame+fashion" and how that relates to sexuality.
0.81 	 but this one is just another "trust me i know what is good for you" deeply (not so well done i might add) subliminal messages.
0.98 	 Try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear.
0.63 	 When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes off their farm, Bo and Luke sneak around Hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal.
0.71 	 At last!
0.55 	 we've done it!
0.98 	 Great cast.
0.88 	 Great acting.
0.95 	 I was really wanting to know what was going to<br /><br />happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and how their<br /><br />seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined.
1.0 	 This movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and skimpy clothes at the worst.
0.59 	 Wow.
0.95 	 Without warning, the ship's Cerebral (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Soon, there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship's astrogators (Penny), the captain (Cary), and the director of the shipping line (Kenyon).<br /><br />It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main Cerebral is acting<br /><br />erratically.
0.99 	 The film does slow down at times and has pacing<br /><br />problems, but is generally well made and well acted.
0.65 	 I think I will now go on to read the novel.
0.99 	 As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s.
0.89 	 The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools.
0.95 	 Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant.
0.98 	 In fact, the main character lives in a mansion.
0.67 	 So the seniors go about doing this.
0.51 	 ?
1.0 	 And that's the beginning of the big Ponderosa like ranch they start.<br /><br />Along the way Foster marries Dix's sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors.
0.83 	 He even kicks a metal jail door (Indian) and kicks a moving car far away (Teesri Aankh).
0.67 	 But I'm sure most people know this already.
0.96 	 A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece, by using violence.
1.0 	 Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone.
0.75 	 Give me a break.
0.77 	 It is so simple.
0.57 	 Just like Zappa did many years ago.
0.92 	 Leon are by many still the little girl in "krummernes Jul", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role.
0.71 	 I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down.
0.87 	 Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like "Film folket"!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see RÃ¥zone.
1.0 	 Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes.
1.0 	 I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best.
0.76 	 Good luck next time.
0.51 	 :-(
0.93 	 "Their" portion of the film consists of characteristic (but first-rate) slapstick involving the chimney, the roof, shovels, and a number of unfortunate mishaps.
0.88 	 For those who did not watch this movie - watch it.
0.97 	 Don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because this is Kosturica.
0.66 	 I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews.
0.96 	 The story is slow and weak, but entertaining.
1.0 	 The acting is bad, but no worse than you will find on the SyFy Channel.
0.98 	 There was no sex scenes.
0.99 	 I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do.
0.99 	 The gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil is quite creepy.
0.65 	 Some movies, by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through...here you just feel depressed.
0.99 	 The scene where Louis injects his deceased, now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad, because the cat did not deserve this.
0.93 	 R for violence.
0.84 	 I watched this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibit.
0.95 	 It certainly prepared me.
0.71 	 At the time I am writing this I see out of over 15,000 votes it has a 5.8 rating.
0.98 	 Something is wrong with that picture.
0.81 	 Won 3 Oscars.
0.83 	 Why?
0.91 	 Because I had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy, as well the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer.<br /><br />And soccer is the red line in this movie.
0.53 	 plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff.
0.51 	 Forward to the 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in DA RAMONES, whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ guest shot, "The Real" Don Steele).
0.99 	 One of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it.
0.6 	 But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover.
0.98 	 In the meantime, the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse, but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions.
0.98 	 Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for kids or people that go to church every Sunday.
0.54 	 Hm.
0.98 	 I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene.
0.66 	 This movie is.......well.......okay.
0.89 	 Just kidding!
0.87 	 It's NOT a Block Buster smash hit.
0.96 	 It's not meant to be.
0.72 	 Who read this script and said, "Sound's great!
0.87 	 Original!"
0.83 	 Of course it is another story, following in the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on in which Chuck Norris, of course, is the one man who can same America from some bad guys.
0.98 	 Big surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris film's is Chuck's son Eric.
1.0 	 Eric Norris has primarily worked on all his father's films and TV shows.
0.81 	 Afterall, he's directing the same people as before in the same stories as before...only difference is the characters' names.
1.0 	 i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking.
0.9 	 as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick.
1.0 	 people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all.
0.92 	 don't expect something from a movie that it isn't.
0.7 	 it still in a general area wasn't that good.
0.66 	 THE QURAN IS PUBLIC!
0.61 	 you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it's true or false...<br /><br />The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related.
0.65 	 that they are "cool dudes".
1.0 	 They grow older...and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things, thinking that they are great people.<br /><br />One could expect such a film from Hollywood, but France?
0.91 	 her mother is out of this world, i think she is the devils daughter.
0.53 	 Soon after the film begins, Andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues he'll be off the force.
0.89 	 A bit later, while investigating a crime he's attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself.
0.99 	 This time he does NOT use excessive force but the assailant is killed.
0.96 	 Andrews panics and assumes they won't believe him so he tries to cover up the death--though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime.<br /><br />There's a lot more to the film than this--including a plot involving a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney).
1.0 	 I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead.
0.65 	 Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea.
0.9 	 Like to play MST3K, the home game.
1.0 	 But it's just come out as a cheap release on DVD and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13.
0.95 	 I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie it will not disappoint.
1.0 	 We never learn why these young men are friends.
0.67 	 They may share confusions about the world and their places in it, but they don't seem to have anything else in common.
0.93 	 Bruce Dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach, Karen Black is the older, married lady Tepper is having an affair with, and Michael Margotta is Tepper's wayward friend (in an off-putting, over-the-top performance).
0.97 	 Perhaps if "Drive, He Said" ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain, audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste.
0.73 	 "Ever see a millionaire fry in the electric hair?
0.96 	 Hell no.
0.96 	 One for the rich and one for the poor," says Wilson, taking a swig of alcohol behind the wheel.<br /><br />Both are destined to cross the path of a farm family, showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind.<br /><br />Blake, reminiscing about movies, and thinking of hunting for gold in Mexico, says: "Remember Bogart in 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'?"
0.8 	 (An ironic moment, because Blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling lottery tickets).
0.63 	 "Don't people around here lock doors?"
0.99 	 "They will tonight," is the terse reply.<br /><br />After the murders, the killers discover that there was "no big fat safe in the wall", like their prison informant told them.
1.0 	 So, in the end, it was truly a stupid, senseless crime.
0.98 	 The question is: WHY did they do it?
0.63 	 "It makes no sense," Blake tells Forsythe.
0.9 	 I thought so right up until the time I cut his throat."
0.98 	 The screenplay by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point--and so is his direction.<br /><br />Summing up: Brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere $43.
1.0 	 I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One.
0.68 	 I discovered, after reading some of the other reviews, that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film, which deeply puzzles me, because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution.
0.78 	 We see, for the first three-quarters of the movie, young Ned.
0.79 	 We see Ned again, and it is, of course, the same actor playing the boy.
0.52 	 Five minutes later, "three weeks later" appears on the screen, and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older Ned.
0.89 	 Good God!
0.73 	 Furthermore, the kid who plays the "older" Ned does not look any older than "young" Ned.
0.79 	 Because he was in it for the first hour and a half, and then all of a sudden, three weeks later, the guy from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is playing Ned for the last five minutes of the movie.
0.89 	 I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I could find movies not available to me in the stores.
0.99 	 I became such a fan girl all over again.<br /><br />It is a bit slow in the beginning, I will admit.
0.95 	 I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited down.
0.52 	 Whew!
0.78 	 I'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly Christian.
0.7 	 If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this film.
0.89 	 I should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments.
0.58 	 Oh well.
1.0 	 I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic!!
0.92 	 Sure it should be on DVD but surely at least a video?
0.93 	 Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence.
0.6 	 It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shootÂ TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them.
0.88 	 In the meantime, the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents.
1.0 	 (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.)
1.0 	 Everybody looks great, but so what?
0.98 	 Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm.
0.89 	 "They All Laughed" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular.
0.99 	 His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes.
0.94 	 But "Laughed" is a faint echo of "The Last Picture Show", "Paper Moon" or "What's Up, Doc"- following "Daisy Miller" and "At Long Last Love", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B.

0.7 	 And as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand.<br /><br />In other words Â if you don't understand the issues the film is addressing, please don't embarrass yourself by offering comments which Â frankly Â make no sense.

1.0 	 After all, these were experts in their fields who were testifying with no apparent reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong wasn't apparent to me at all.
0.99 	 To this point, beyond some hearsay testimony in the trials, hardly anyone had ever heard of a dingo attacking a human; people didn't believe it was possible.
0.89 	 The book shook me for that reason, and I've been reluctant to come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt ever since (excepting OJ of course).
0.99 	 Too bad it didn't receive more publicity at the time it was released.

0.97 	 Istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that Errol Flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS.
0.95 	 It's a remake of the Fred MacMurray- Ava Gardner film Singapore from a decade ago.<br /><br />Unlike that studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the Golden Horn.
0.58 	 But Errol Flynn, who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film, was way too old to be playing these action/adventure types any longer.
0.78 	 She both doesn't remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher.
0.93 	 <br /><br />But Errol's got some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession.

0.99 	 Most people today don't realize that Cole was an accomplished jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer.
0.77 	 Actually he was a pianist first, the singing was an afterthought.<br /><br />Istanbul is a routine action/adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie.
0.87 	 So we should use it to speak the truth, say what we think, and not be afraid if others are offended.<br /><br />Carlos is the bomb.
0.99 	 Im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining (dont mind women).
0.96 	 I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions.
0.75 	 I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development.
1.0 	 Next, we all love suspense.
0.99 	 That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises.
0.52 	 Yeah, Prom Night had none of that!
0.82 	 Of course, we like a terrifying killer.
0.64 	 Prom Night have that?
0.77 	 Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife.
0.6 	 And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene!
0.85 	 I'd call it more of a comedy.
0.72 	 Where will horror go next??
0.51 	 ?
0.98 	 There's not much I can say, but the movie is a feel-good movie I guess.
0.93 	 If you like musicals, I'd say you'd like this one!
0.97 	 I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist.
0.63 	 Such is the dilemma(above) that Debbie must face at the close of this Sam Sherman production Naughty Stewardesses.
1.0 	 Through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul-searching, what in heaven's name will Debbie do?
0.78 	 Let's face it.
0.69 	 Naughty Stewardesses is just what it wants to be(at least two-thirds through): a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70's way film.
0.69 	 There is no grand art here.
0.93 	 The movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes.
0.89 	 By todays standards, the film is pretty tame.
0.92 	 This is, as another reviewer noted, more of a Sam Sherman piece then and Al Adamson piece.
0.95 	 You can tell when Al is in complete charge.
0.97 	 Adamson does a decent job directing this time and I have to give Sherman credit to a degree.
0.98 	 I liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs.
1.0 	 I even liked the music of Sparrow.
0.87 	 "Silver Heels" was a somewhat catchy tune.
0.89 	 As for the cast, yes, Bob Livingston is a bit old for the lead, but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well.
0.98 	 The girls have all got great sets, so what else was required of them huh?
0.97 	 Naughty Stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade.
0.87 	 So, he has only one choice to host the game, with a thousand dollar tab.
0.5 	 It allows for the predictable twists in the story, in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character, of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets (gangsters and dancers and the "saitn" played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando).
0.64 	 I think many so-called action movies copied a lot many "escape scenes" from this movie!!
0.72 	 I recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance!!
0.86 	 Surely he could have fit another Red Skelton film or two on his schedule!
0.99 	 He's a PI and she's his wife and sleuthing partner.
1.0 	 They engage in "humorous" banter with each other.
0.71 	 See?
0.82 	 It's completely different already.
0.69 	 Heflin's the only one here who hints at bigger and better things, although he's real close to being a jerk in this.
1.0 	 Hmmm.<br /><br />Quickly, the 'murder' is that of bitchy schemer Mida King, who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one.
0.89 	 She's played by Patricia Dane, who's like a C- version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There's a whole array of wacky suspects, all with their own motivation for wanting Mida dead.
0.93 	 Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, jittery type, something I believe he may have done before.
0.91 	 Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder.
0.67 	 Also in newspapers and TV, it made big sense.
0.88 	 It has been many indefinite scenes, sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on.
0.51 	 She acts better in comedy films, In this movie, a kind of drama, she couldn't disposed of her previous role.
0.66 	 In fact, Bon Jovi and the two Vampire girls, Natasha Wagner and Arly Jover probably all fit in the same clothes.
1.0 	 Bon Jovi has the most charisma.
0.93 	 At least he looks happy when he is smiling.
0.99 	 Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires.
0.76 	 Throughout the movie, these Vampire Hunters who are obviously trying to kill Arly Jover (the top vampire in the world??)
0.77 	 keep reaching out to her.
0.71 	 I just want to talk to you.
0.53 	 I want to get to know you."
0.85 	 "Why Can't We Be Friends" the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie.
0.79 	 I guess Blood Type is not important?
0.51 	 So apparently Bon Jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body.
0.87 	 And just like the first VAMPIRES, this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect.
0.84 	 They are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety.
0.97 	 Most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless (such as Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps).
0.99 	 And, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz.
0.62 	 Considering what I think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world!<br /><br />Anyway, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic, but not something I would rush out to watch.
0.99 	 The documentarian also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations.
0.5 	 Please watch this movie critically, and read reviews beforehand.
0.83 	 Most reviews argue that the documentarian takes his arguments too far, even if he raises questions that target the conventional wisdom regarding the war.
0.99 	 I do not advise against seeing this documentary, but I do caution you to examine it with an especially critical eye (as one should do at all times anyway).
0.62 	 There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked.
0.82 	 Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable.
0.59 	 For a film that's ostensibly about sex and leather, it doesn't have any right to be as oddly sweet as it is.
0.8 	 Rather like this film, in fact.
0.81 	 We'll have to content ourselves with the DVD or VHS if even that...
0.72 	 I don't want to say much about the story because I don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.
0.87 	 This is a quite slow paced movie, slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger.
0.94 	 Both main characters are deeply unsympathetic, and the scene where Laura Linney's character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son -- which I think is supposed to be poignant -- is just horrifying.
0.99 	 Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A.
0.58 	 CONFIDENTIAL).
0.99 	 Troubles arise as we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93).
0.64 	 When Pete fails a polygraph test, he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series).<br /><br />As the presidential assassination plot unfolds, Pete finds himself on the run from his own people.
0.86 	 His only confidant is the First Lady, and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place).
0.9 	 But is Pete really innocent?
0.74 	 If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service?
0.99 	 <br /><br />And what's with David Breckinridge's (Kiefer's) new partner, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)?
0.98 	 file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur (!)
0.63 	 I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw.
0.86 	 <br /><br />Sadly, there probably won't be a "Kingdom 3"--Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this was filmed.
0.68 	 But you never know!
0.51 	 1/10!
0.55 	 >.<
0.92 	 First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature.
0.97 	 This movie really shows its age.
0.91 	 This film aka "the four hundred blows" is a mistranslation.Faire les 400 coups" means"to live a wild life.
1.0 	 As a French,I'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good ,but by no means outstanding film.
0.98 	 1.It's not the first film of the "nouvelle vague" move;check Agnes Varda's "la pointe courte",(1956)Alain Resnais's "Hiroshima mon amour"(1958),Claude Chabrol's "le beau serge"(1958) are anterior .Historically,"les 400 coups " comes after.
0.52 	 2.The "nouvelle vague" was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors:Overnight,Julien Duvivier,Henri-George Clouzot,Claude Autant-Lara ,Yves allÃ©gret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion.THis selfishness and this contempt is typically "nouvelle vague".You 've never heard (or read) the great generation of the thirties (Renoir,CarnÃ©,GrÃ©millon,Duvivier already,Feyder) laugh at ,say,Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder.So,thanks to Truffaut and co,some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties(Duvuvier's "sous le ciel de Paris",Autant-Lara's "douce",Yves AllÃ©gret's "une si jolie petite plage " and "manÃ¨ges").THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler,Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless!
0.59 	 "Les 400 coups " is technically rather disappointing:it's very academic ,the story is as linear as it can be,the teachers are caricatures,and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is): Well ,your father 's got only his brevet (junior school diploma)and,as for me ,I've got only my high school diploma!You've got to know,that circa 1960,hardly 10%of the pupils had the HSD in France!
1.0 	 4.Compared to the innovations of "Hiroshima mon amour",which features a brand new form,and a new "fragmented " content,"les 400 coups " pales into significance.Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior "Jules and Jim", helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau.
0.97 	 5.The interpretation is rather stiff;Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud ,arguably listenable when dubbed in English ,is still decent,but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation.
0.59 	 Vulgar fantasies came to life on screen.
0.94 	 For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey.
0.55 	 When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence.
0.53 	 One day, he hears singing coming from the basement.
0.99 	 And not a few phrases either.
0.75 	 Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.<br /><br />The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha.
0.89 	 Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter.
1.0 	 The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!
0.88 	 And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly.
0.74 	 He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck.
0.92 	 Only for those promises to be broken time and again.<br /><br />Paulie is admittedly a little episodic.
0.68 	 Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant.
0.61 	 And Paulie even gets to have a romance.
0.8 	 That may be the only complaint I have.
0.95 	 But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes.
0.67 	 The same laughs.
0.95 	 As others have mentioned, this movie is similar to THE FLY (both versions) and the lesser known sci-fi flick ALTERED STATES.
0.92 	 The big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it.
0.87 	 METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages.
1.0 	 And oh yes, watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy.
0.7 	 Some of the lines are classic: "What WAS it?"
0.93 	 Yes, it is goofy, but I fell over laughing so I can't complain.<br /><br />I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased.
0.67 	 I'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing, as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on DVD.
0.91 	 It might also be possible to find this movie online for free.
0.76 	 But this one brought my faith back.<br /><br />Leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled, rich but charistmatic high school student guy.
0.85 	 He was such a revelation!!
1.0 	 And it didn't show us any unnecessary nude, sex scenes.
0.69 	 Nixon's role possesses the best lines, but she often homes in on them too quickly, a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director.
0.9 	 It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense, in plot but especially in character motivations.
0.64 	 If you want to see something funny go watch "No On Would Tell" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show.
0.99 	 Watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.
0.87 	 I firmly believe that the N64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made.
0.66 	 A must have for any N64 owner, and a reason to get an N64 for everyone else.
0.74 	 I gave this movie "3" and two of those points are for Mira Sorvino's sexy movements on the dance floor.
0.71 	 Sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films, but what TV shows don't do that these days.
0.75 	 The direction seemed to be of realism.
0.57 	 The first Home Alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting.
0.81 	 It (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same.
0.98 	 The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool).
0.92 	 There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films.
0.99 	 All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence.
0.95 	 I recommend this to huge fans of the series only.
0.51 	 3/10
0.83 	 (Backbone of England.)
0.93 	 Still, she's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!
1.0 	 Pilcher couldn't come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus.<br /><br />and finally:<br /><br />Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' Boarding-School, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation.
1.0 	 Her best bit of advice: "I've only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once.
1.0 	 I thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world."
0.94 	 They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well.
0.92 	 After all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!
0.56 	 "<br /><br />Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot.
0.82 	 When not crying, her eyes are moist.
1.0 	 That's the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is "dewy-eyed.

0.64 	 Still, I'll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder .

0.99 	 had a crush on (when, I don't know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE's going to find him there.)
0.61 	 Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be "whisked away" SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!
1.0 	 )<br /><br />Great drama.
0.96 	 over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.<br /><br />The acting on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene.
0.99 	 He was writing about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother.
0.83 	 Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit themselves to Goldstien's Brotherhood and confess their crimes.
0.98 	 I am like others, I will not support ANY new shows until they have been given a second season.
0.6 	 The attempts at humor are not.
0.53 	 Who acts this way?
0.74 	 Looking at his bio, it is shocking he lived in New York and wonder how much real connection he had with the community.
0.81 	 This movie plays out about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reading the script for "Scarface."
0.66 	 and "Crikey!")
0.88 	 and strangely choreographed action sequences.
0.58 	 At one point, Irwin mounts a speeding RV and knife fights with a CIA agent on top of it.
0.87 	 Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin knife fights a guy on top of an RV.
0.89 	 Other oddities include: the Denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat; Pauline, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; Mr. Chinnery, kind-hearted vet and menace to all things four-legged; Geoff Tipps, a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour, often involving guns, electric tubes and .
0.98 	 There are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds.
0.79 	 It's not Arthur Miller or T.S.
0.51 	 I turned it off in about 20 minutes.<br /><br />I will be asking for my money back at Block Buster!
0.51 	 Mark from Ontario, Canada
0.56 	 Let me start by saying I've just come direct from viewing this movie, and the images are still burned deep into my brain - and I don't think they'll be moving any time soon.<br /><br />It's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it.
0.6 	 If not, let me forewarn you that this is not a moderate-budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la "Near Dark", nor is it a low budget, schlocky, "fun" B-movie.
0.96 	 The idea is a simple one - seven stories revolving around, and ending in, suicides interspersed with footage of a decomposing corpse.
1.0 	 Sounds simple right, even boring?
0.98 	 It isn't.
0.97 	 Words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through; it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not.<br /><br />I could go on a ramble here about the technical pros and cons of the direction; maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super-8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky.
0.98 	 I could point out that some of the sound effects are out-of-sync in a way to rival any Fulci movie, but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into insignificance.<br /><br />As far as extreme movies go, I've seen the hardest of them, and yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few others have managed, despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that I would consider "gratuitous".
0.88 	 I won't ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually drips from the screen and makes you sympathise, if not yearn for his end.
0.99 	 If you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or "nice" movies, or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless, this is not what you're looking for.
0.99 	 Although this is generally a cheesy jungle-adventure movie, it does have some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful, and the pacing of the adventure is good.
0.9 	 He never takes things seriously .
0.96 	 Shower is there as decoration and Keith makes extensive use of her - she doesn't really have to act much.
0.86 	 A good 2 AM cable programmer.
1.0 	 Every Christmas eve I make my kids endure yet another showing of It's A Wonderful Life.
0.92 	 I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa.
1.0 	 I like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing.
0.94 	 What would the Christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of Santa in all his guises, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton?
0.99 	 "Fred" is a perfectly OK holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids.
0.98 	 My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince.
0.99 	 Paul Giamatti was a top-notch Santa, which helped a lot.
1.0 	 Not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual Christmas traditions.
0.74 	 But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice.
0.8 	 I reflect back to the days when I held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when I was 16.
0.94 	 The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models.
0.55 	 This is were this film cross the race, age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped.
0.77 	 This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves.
0.94 	 Yes poverty still exists, racism, sexism, and any other ism that we can added.
0.78 	 Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self-destructive, everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future.
0.65 	 OK.
0.99 	 There are people who should not see this movie.<br /><br />1) Don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour.
0.98 	 2) Don't like it if you got offended by _The Watchmen_.
0.67 	 3) Don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie.<br /><br />The rest of you, run, don't walk, to see _Mystery Men_.
1.0 	 Utterly unserious, somewhat weird, but -good-.
1.0 	 Ridley Scott is a wonderful director.
0.83 	 But this film is a black mark on his career.
0.56 	 And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way.
0.99 	 At 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit, but that actually is not a bad point for it.
0.97 	 After beating up the poor professor, Ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor/engineer (Ben Turpin in a nice brief appearance), and then faces his doctor (Jimmy Finleyson) and his nerve tester (a balloon that inflates as you push air out of Ollie's stomach).
0.96 	 Finleyson announces that it is a bad case of "horniphobia", and Ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat's milk.
0.66 	 They end up going to a ship but Ollie and Stan know nothing about seamanship - so they plan to sleep on the ship.
0.98 	 Unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off.
0.55 	 Also unfortunately, on board is Richard Cramer, an escaped dangerous criminal.
0.8 	 There are some very amusing moments in the film - the discoveries of how Turpin's ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment; the accidental remarks of building manager Charlie Hall when Stan or Ollie runs by him and asks for directions ("Can you help me find the basement?"
0.85 	 asks Stan - "Certainly,you can't miss it - it's downstairs!
0.99 	 ", says Hall, who realizes what a stupid comment he just made); and Cramer's mistreatment of his two hostage slaves.
0.93 	 Cramer has the boys cook him up some food - and they make a synthetic meal (boot laces for spaghetti, for instance) to get him sick to be overpowered.
0.82 	 Unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been.
0.95 	 Having finally completed my Christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon, I had nowhere else to go to escape "The Land That Time Forgot".
0.52 	 Or rather, I had nothing else to watch.<br /><br />Doug McClure, that bastion of leading-man actors, leads a handful of Allied sailors sunk by a U-Boat somewhere in the Atlantic in 1916.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Despite being made few years before "Star Wars", these films are light-years apart in terms of special effects.
0.89 	 The model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of Gerry Anderson's "Stingray" and the creatures aren't much better either.
0.76 	 Characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves.
0.9 	 Overall, this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where Colin Farrell is.
0.58 	 Oh well.
1.0 	 Nothing particularly great here to see then, but just about OK if you're eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity.
0.94 	 I'd recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore Dispensationalists.
0.75 	 I'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with Maltin on this one.
1.0 	 It would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", but lacks that film's poignancy and charm.
0.5 	 Most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid.
0.82 	 We both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie.
0.94 	 I picked up Time Changer because it looked like a nice low-budget scifi time travel movie and I was in the mood for something like that.
0.95 	 Our hero, who is a bible professor from the 1890s, eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - Jesus is nowhere to be found.
0.94 	 This wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional HG-Wells-style time machine.
0.55 	 So, if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors, then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as I don't think there's any evidence (and none was offered) for the physics of time travel in the bible.
0.66 	 It was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year (as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself, a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date: it's just two thousand and... *honk*).
0.81 	 For instance, the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van.
0.86 	 The rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the TV which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote.<br /><br />Unfortunately, our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder.
0.9 	 Eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of Christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful, but mostly was just more of the same.
0.74 	 A couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy (go figure) and investigate his name.
0.85 	 as the scene fades out.
0.63 	 "Because it makes the plot more interesting"<br /><br />and<br /><br />"You made your way in here, now you can make your way out again !"
0.92 	 That's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire!
0.97 	 I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty lackluster.
0.87 	 I think of sideways when I think of this movie but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall...
0.65 	 In all honesty I really did expect something more from this film.
0.53 	 Maybe something along the lines of 'Conspiracy Theory'.
0.92 	 I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all.
0.85 	 But instead of an absorbing action cum mystery drama I was caught up in a pastiche of breakneck silliness a lÃ  'The Goonies', which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise.
1.0 	 It's how one can enjoy sci-fi and horror.
0.82 	 The Masons.
0.8 	 The Knights Templars.
0.88 	 You know, this could really be true!"
0.83 	 I think the writer really lost me when Gates said the Founding Fathers hid the treasure to keep it out of the hands of the British!
0.63 	 And just were did the Knights Templar come from?
0.97 	 New Jersey?
0.89 	 From France!
0.83 	 Which goes a long way to explain how it ended up in Philadelphia during the Revolution.
0.99 	 It was brought there by agents of Napoleon!
0.69 	 The premise of the movie is interesting.
0.92 	 And I really do think it could have succeeded as a serious mystery drama.
0.63 	 But it just comes off as another kid flick in grown-up clothing.
0.82 	 But it's the sort of movie, well, have you ever stood outside a cinema waiting to get in while the previous audience comes out?
0.89 	 And all the young kids are talking excitedly among themselves and saying things like, "Wow!
0.86 	 That was so cool!"
0.64 	 'National Treasure' is that kind of movie.
0.96 	 The movie has very few good points to talk about.
0.94 	 Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be.
0.82 	 But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real.
0.85 	 I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies.
0.99 	 The last good action I have seen was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi".
0.68 	 The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me.
0.87 	 Does these people see their movie after completion?
1.0 	 I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes.
0.99 	 The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than current era scenes.
0.84 	 Please don't make any more action movies, until you acquire the art of making it realistic.
0.79 	 Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing.
0.99 	 The present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock.
0.93 	 We see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home.
0.72 	 Marty, the father, comes only for the week-end; he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets, mostly.
0.99 	 In a few days the first man will walk in space, so the excitement is evident.<br /><br />The Kantrowitz women are left behind.
1.0 	 Pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte; she gets the salesman as well.
0.93 	 Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears!
0.97 	 Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana, who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard!<br /><br />Watch it at your risk, or pop the DVD in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh, or two dishing the film.
0.67 	 For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion .
0.99 	 NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point .
0.91 	 Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding TWISTER
0.99 	 East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy.
0.85 	 It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles.
0.67 	 This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man.
0.8 	 "Prom Night" is a title-only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen.
1.0 	 This movie takes place in an Oregon town, where Donna (Brittany Snow) is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years.
1.0 	 She and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives.
0.95 	 Boredom.
0.75 	 Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the pre-teen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen.
0.99 	 Take Carpenter's "Halloween" for example - little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie.
0.99 	 The tension and suspense here is mild at best, and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99% of the time.
0.96 	 The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be.
0.99 	 Johnathan Schaech plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he isn't that impressive.
1.0 	 However, I did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical 'masked-stalker' type killer we see a lot.
0.51 	 3/10.
0.65 	 It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the MediocreLand?
0.98 	 The crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness.
0.99 	 And that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, "This could be me" sentiment.
0.95 	 Somebody should give them a Code of Ethics to read (the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it).
0.97 	 No therapists are that bad.<br /><br />Women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death, we've all graduated "Sex and the City".
0.84 	 The only successful/palatable developments are Addison struggling with her decision to move to LA, and the "Voodoo Dr" and his coping with widowhood.<br /><br />This concept might work with a whole new writing team.
0.92 	 Watch Apollo 13 again.
0.85 	 Silent film making was pure art, it had to hold the attention through its structure, direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions.
1.0 	 A poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable.<br /><br />This film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of Christian themes.
0.99 	 This is not a 'Christiany' film, it is not selling anything.
0.93 	 NY Times 1922.<br /><br />Maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and, learned some lessons.<br /><br />The Pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500,000.
0.88 	 Chaplin used this device often and copied some of from Pickford.<br /><br />Another special observation to be made about Silent films and especially Pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored, with the actors over-exposure.
1.0 	 I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly clichÃ©, but I was completely wrong!
0.83 	 But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie.
0.78 	 <br /><br />Overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick at all!
0.98 	 Sommer is given a ride to a<br /><br />mysterious house in the country, where Savalas happens to be<br /><br />butler.
0.88 	 The house's blind matriarch's<br /><br />husband had an affair with the dead woman, who was the<br /><br />matriarch's son's fiancee.
0.76 	 There are half baked ideas, abandoned plotlines, and<br /><br />stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing<br /><br />in some sort of forward direction.
0.99 	 The<br /><br />only thing we know about her is her name.<br /><br />This is a real weird film, and your reaction to it might depend on<br /><br />how heavily you are into Eurohorror, and Kojak.
0.84 	 I for one cannot<br /><br />recomment "Lisa and the Devil.
0.75 	 "<br /><br />This is unrated, and including all the extras at the end of the VHS<br /><br />copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong<br /><br />gore, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and adult<br /><br />situations
0.84 	 This 2003 made for TV movie was shown on a women's channel, naturally.
0.94 	 Number one bore is Joyce Hyser as the wife.
0.97 	 The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you'd ever want to meet.
0.92 	 Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband, again played as a guy who is a loser, by David DeLuise.
0.97 	 Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero.
0.69 	 Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say victim, was not that good.
0.98 	 Men, beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder.
0.85 	 LMN is the channel.
0.77 	 Note: Having watched this a second time by mistake, I am convinced on my initial thoughts.
0.79 	 Especially on the writer/director, Simon Gornick.
0.9 	 Down with Gornick's movie and his vacant stars in it.
0.8 	 None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either.
0.97 	 The effects are really neat in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough.
1.0 	 George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners.
0.97 	 The second story, "The Raft", is a Stephen King story.
0.96 	 The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film.
1.0 	 Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens.
1.0 	 "The Hitch-hiker" works the best out of these three offerings, but it's not without its problems either.
0.88 	 As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns.
0.81 	 Tom Savini appears as the "creep" in this installment.
0.83 	 *1/2 of 4 stars.
0.64 	 I was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover.
1.0 	 Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a Wild West troupe, one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling-to-break-even touring show.
0.99 	 Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke Â Eastwood's girlfriend at the time).
0.73 	 But are we really supposed to believe that she couldn't get back to New York and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort?<br /><br />No, the point of this film seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin.
0.89 	 This is a warm, fuzzy film Â or at least tries to be.
0.91 	 Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards.
0.99 	 This minor flaw is easily ignored.
0.81 	 There is so much to discover in this story.
0.92 	 The humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way.
0.56 	 Absolutely recommended.
0.62 	 Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre.
1.0 	 That sure is misleading, isn't it?
0.93 	 Fortunately, I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation.
0.95 	 In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I fully expected it to simply be a Drama.
0.92 	 I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes.<br /><br />Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'.
1.0 	 Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial.
0.81 	 Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie.
0.77 	 He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood.
0.94 	 His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color.
0.84 	 I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away).
1.0 	 Preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when Preston jumped a row of cars.<br /><br />Of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine.
0.96 	 Of course, the FBI finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground.
0.98 	 Our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the FBI is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on.<br /><br />Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this film.
0.98 	 This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods.
0.99 	 One of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus.
0.69 	 For one, it tries to be many genres at once.
0.84 	 There's a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny.
0.69 	 The violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared.
0.92 	 The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random.
0.55 	 In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion.
0.87 	 I didn't care for most of the characters.
0.95 	 I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday.
0.96 	 She looked gorgeous.
0.82 	 Second of all, through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca's films.
0.63 	 I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional.
0.97 	 Why did they get rid of her?!
0.61 	 The show not the same as before.
0.99 	 You can't replace someone from the beginning!
0.72 	 It's not right!
1.0 	 The niece who replaced her is just, ugh!
0.8 	 Awful.
0.91 	 She doesn't fit into the storyline at all.
0.88 	 She was one of the main characters, and the niece can't replace her.
0.51 	 Get her back, or you'll lose a TON of viewers.
0.5 	 Stunts, and rock.
0.81 	 It goes back and forth.
0.78 	 They work, they meet girls, they party.
0.67 	 End of story.<br /><br />The band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second-tier, and playing a style that was already dated in 1978.
0.97 	 It has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that Aussie fellow really is something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the "art".
0.67 	 More of a bitter-sweet, faux-cumentery, this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously.
0.73 	 Although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this film.<br /><br />The main character of the movie is Michael,a political activist who goes on the road in the US against the Vietnam-war.
0.85 	 The ending is very poor(father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy),but I let this slip away from my vote(the rest of the movie is very good!).
0.51 	 Look closely for Wavy"Woodstock Speaker"Gravy(What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400.000!)
0.97 	 It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling.
0.99 	 Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero.
0.87 	 What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors, turned out to be a B-movie at best.
0.64 	 In this day and age, we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film, and this film offered neither.
0.98 	 Only the most ardent DORIS DAY fan could find this one even bearable to watch.
0.96 	 There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world.
0.72 	 this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality TV, and now, the phenomenon is rampant!
0.68 	 i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie.
1.0 	 Monika Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence.
1.0 	 Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after.
0.86 	 Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition...Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts.
1.0 	 The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shot away.
0.92 	 Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh.
0.95 	 I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued.
0.93 	 A woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car.
0.93 	 First, the title.
0.67 	 The Broken?
0.87 	 The Broken...what?
0.98 	 WOW, clever!
0.94 	 A more suited title would be 'The Boring', since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages.
0.84 	 It's based on a cartoon series.
0.99 	 To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and<br /><br />Rupert Everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandon<br /><br />of men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance.
0.94 	 After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer.
0.99 	 For the life of me I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie......and I think I have the qualifications to say so....
0.97 	 I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in the "lifestyle" ...
0.96 	 Get Real... EOD clearing buildings???
0.85 	 Get Real....
0.7 	 The cast is made up of kids mainly, but there is a role here for Tom Savini; who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department.
0.75 	 The only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves.
0.97 	 There's nothing to recommend this film for really; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment here.
0.98 	 *some spoilers*<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms (acting, dated dialogue, unclear storyline) unfounded.
0.5 	 After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles.
0.94 	 But Belafonte wasn't allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith), so he never got his wings.
0.53 	 Sound familiar anyone?
0.52 	 I refer to "Alive" from 1993.
0.51 	 Mwuhahahaa!
0.97 	 The fourth "Tremors" feature goes back in time, to the year 1889.
0.99 	 "The Legend Begins" in the small city of "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada".
0.86 	 Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer).
0.72 	 It's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster "Graboids".
0.84 	 These tamer "Dirt Dragons" are nowhere near as terrorizing as their "Tremors" (1990) counterparts.
1.0 	 Disappointing.<br /><br />**** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
0.69 	 What do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS?
0.8 	 You make a movie, of course.
0.86 	 The probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production.
1.0 	 There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap.
0.93 	 And why would it be?
1.0 	 There is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes.The cast is good.
0.98 	 Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, so here was finally a role quite suitable for him.
0.99 	 Bosworth is cute so it's irrelevant how she acts (she's solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite annoying, is rather good, to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that I didn't recognize him at first.
0.99 	 (I wish they did that to Cruise in every movie so I wouldn't have to watch his dumb face.)
1.0 	 I utterly failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and wouldn't have known she was in it, had I not seen her name in the end-credits.
0.96 	 (Btw, "Friends" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.)
1.0 	 The only casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo.
0.89 	 You thought I'd include Paris Hilton, too, didn't you?
0.73 	 No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore.
0.66 	 The children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in.
0.99 	 This film lacked the music/dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love.
0.7 	 The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film.
0.8 	 I'm always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes.
0.97 	 Patrica had basically 3 emotions.
0.9 	 Quiet, in great pain, or really angry she has stigmata.
0.53 	 The first was the predominate one, the second involved screaming pain, the third involving raising her voice.
0.99 	 Initially, I would have thought that Secret Sunshine had something critical to say of religion (and here being Christianity), and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith, or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou.
0.84 	 Or when you discover how hypocritical man can be, portraying one face inside the house of God, and displaying yet another outside.<br /><br />Shin-ae and her son Jun moves to the town of Miryang, which is the birthplace of her deceased husband.
0.85 	 It is then either we fall by the wayside, or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously.
0.72 	 One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made "My Bloody Valentine", which I hated alot.
0.78 	 "Valentine" is a better film than that one, but it's not saying much.
0.96 	 Then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up, then they're picked off one-by-one.
0.6 	 The killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge.
0.61 	 But is it him?
0.99 	 "Valentine" has an attractive cast which includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl.
0.93 	 There are some scary moments throughout, however.
1.0 	 This is a classic example of an increasing problem with films.
0.8 	 Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue?
0.97 	 If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles.<br /><br />I give it 4 because Reno was so good in Leon.
0.99 	 People rave about the scenery, but I saw it on a TV & I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
0.51 	 4/10
0.97 	 The humans weren't as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint.
0.99 	 Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script.
0.95 	 I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early movies: her acting back then was light and breezy, and she sure knew how to wear clothes.
0.98 	 Young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband (Paul Lukas) into becoming a championship bridge player.
0.94 	 As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, even a diver in mid-air, freezing in anticipation of the event.
0.87 	 It's the earliest use of a freeze frame I've seen in an American film.
0.8 	 The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US.
0.92 	 Unfortunately, this just makes the film a little less convincing.
0.75 	 OK, I am not Japanese.
0.99 	 I do know a little about Japanese culture, and a little less about Japanese pop culture.
0.97 	 Other than that, I am Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor.<br /><br />Good, with that point set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this.
1.0 	 The idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes.
0.86 	 It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene.<br /><br />I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this.
0.95 	 Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes.
0.98 	 But hell, if you thought Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke.<br /><br />Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European.
0.86 	 Let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.<br /><br />That's all I was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek-strings.
0.68 	 <br /><br />That's actually a tough question to answer fairly.
1.0 	 Detractors of this series tend to argue that it's formulaic and hopelessly dated.
0.96 	 Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; in fact, critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy, and actively seek out, repetitive entertainment.
0.82 	 He tries to publish a story about said monster, but his editor Vincenzo blocks him, always on the grounds that Kolchak doesn't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work.
0.87 	 And, alas, Kolchak is also obstructed by the police.
0.53 	 So, in the end, Kolchak does some independent research on the monster, figures out how to kill it... and then kills it.
1.0 	 Without ceremony, or reward, or writing a big story about it.<br /><br />You can see where this ever-so-strict formula might get tiresome, right?
0.73 	 I'm particularly mystified by Vincenzo - if Kolchak's always raving about monsters, and Vincenzo never believes it... well, then, why doesn't Vincenzo fire Kolchak, or have him committed?
0.97 	 That's what any normal boss would do.
0.53 	 For my money, there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode run: Primal Scream, which is about monkey-men running rampant in Chicago, and the Sentry, which features the dumbest-looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment (and this assessment is coming from a lifelong Doctor Who and Godzilla fan!)
1.0 	 I've always liked Fred MacMurray, andÂalthough her career was tragically cut shortÂI think Carole Lombard is fun to watch.
1.0 	 Skid's a great trumpeter, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall.
0.68 	 During his climb to musical stardom, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start over after he's hit rock bottom.
0.68 	 Ah, yes
it's the true Hollywood happy ending, which comes none too soon.<br /><br />Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this movie is so predictable and slow-paced that it's difficult to watch at times.
0.74 	 Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, just doesn't ring true.<br /><br />This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard.
0.95 	 Other then the bad dub, it isn't bad.<br /><br />The first hour is a lot like the Comic (which is what all Lupin the 3rd stuff is based on).
0.82 	 Any good Lupin fan I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I was after hearing so many bad things about this movie).
1.0 	 It might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall, it isn't a bad film.
0.98 	 I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive.
0.99 	 Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent.
0.94 	 The laughs are very few and far between.
0.9 	 The end surprise for "Mr.
0.95 	 I've read a number of reviews on this film and I have to say "What is wrong with you people?!?!"
0.83 	 Also, there is a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles...not a bad place to start.
0.9 	 Since we have a good old-fashioned video-store in Tucson, I had the chance to watch this 3 1/2-hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten seconds.<br /><br />Since we speak here about one of the most discussed (and most controversially discussed) movies of all times, let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs, originally typical for the early "Nouvelle Vague" of a Jacques Rivette or Alain Resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie.
0.94 	 The dialogs are basically monologues, mainly the longest ones spoken by Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud.
0.96 	 Therefore, one can hardly speak about communication in this movie.
0.83 	 He is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between Nietzsche and Bernanos.
0.97 	 The topless scene threw me for a loop, as I was not expecting it.
0.99 	 There's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, yet the final product is pretty debatable.
0.9 	 The film and its messages are very noble, and I think perhaps most would agree with them.
0.96 	 Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her sister in law.
1.0 	 When the camera stays with these folks, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable.
1.0 	 Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets.
1.0 	 As it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest.<br /><br />Not recommended.
0.77 	 Bear with me.
0.98 	 Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive.
0.86 	 Continue to bear with me.
0.59 	 Finally, the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances, but of course, they can't figure out the improbable motive.
0.96 	 ), and then the fun really starts.<br /><br />The cinematography and acting are OK.
0.98 	 There are a lot of well dressed, very good looking people in this film.
0.57 	 The directing is fair, and the script is a little better than the material deserved.
0.99 	 The best thing about it....
0.59 	 Curiously, scenes in which Walter Brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!<br /><br />Abetted by crackling i.e.
0.81 	 ), while many other scenes have been shortened (i.e.
0.93 	 Tha latter, then, utilizes alternate takes for some scenes Â and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version; however, we also get an obviously tacked-on happy ending (the Pre-Release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open-ended note) and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which, basically, has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche!
0.62 	 Take your basic Frankenstein flick, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Doctor Hackenstein.
0.55 	 What little attempts there are at humor actually work (check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle), but that's hardly enough to recommend this film.
0.6 	 The music is decent, what blood that's there is decent, and the cast looks quite good.
0.73 	 An airplane flying low over the City distracted Jules, and he pointed the camera up, seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One.<br /><br />Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers.
0.98 	 The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film.
0.78 	 A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl.<br /><br />Promising plot notwithstanding, the movie completely lacks charm, or humor, or atmosphere.
0.91 	 Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with the female lead.
0.83 	 Allen apparently can't stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young, and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do.
0.61 	 Like Johansson, he is used merely for his good looks.
0.9 	 This is a shame, because, as Jackman has shown in any number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men," he CAN act.<br /><br />Here's the big plot twist -- Jackman, suave, charming English Lord, really is a killer.
0.71 	 Jackman, the man she's been making love to, is a man who murdered a prostitute.
0.92 	 Nice, Woody.
0.98 	 Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp.<br /><br />In a passive aggressive touch, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, as well, killing off his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film.<br /><br />A final note: at my screening, not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film.
0.83 	 Why?
1.0 	 (The revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing.
0.52 	 They were beautiful but inexperienced.
1.0 	 It would have been so much better with proper actors!
0.96 	 So here's what my reactions to it are.
0.79 	 This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film.
0.57 	 All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.<br /><br />************Contains spoiler************ I find the rape scenes quite tame.
0.93 	 Which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind, especially for someone who is a writer.
0.74 	 <br /><br />Why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive?<br /><br />I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him.
1.0 	 ************************Ends spoiler************<br /><br />But hey, this movie is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer, `Why me?
0.97 	 Maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value I wish I would have skipped it.
0.99 	 Run for your lives!
0.78 	 The monkeys have inherited the Earth!"
0.51 	 He must run into even stranger things on a regular basis.
1.0 	 Besides that, this is Rick Baker's best work yet.
1.0 	 This film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field.
0.51 	 3/10.
0.86 	 His attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person.
0.51 	 Did a leopard kill the young women, or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge?
0.98 	 Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor?
0.96 	 In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed.
0.59 	 DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility.
0.85 	 But Curtis just seems to give up.
0.93 	 In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis didn't.<br /><br />But the film survives this weakness.
0.93 	 The slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session.
0.9 	 And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film.
1.0 	 The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.<br /><br />The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better.
0.94 	 Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbishness respectively.
0.83 	 The film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'Beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women.
0.83 	 Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, The Beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.<br /><br />The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female.
0.98 	 The scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point.
0.67 	 Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame.
0.58 	 It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone.
0.63 	 I think it's time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him.
0.9 	 I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I'd seen, "Burning Moon".
0.74 	 While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time (and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this), I found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene.
0.98 	 Sure, there's gore, and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy.
0.92 	 Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson's movies, especially "Braindead".
0.83 	 3/10 (for pretty good and plentiful gore effects, and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
0.92 	 The same is true for the majority of low-rent horror flicks, especially those Roger Ebert has dubbed "Dead Teenager Movies."
0.58 	 In the Hills Have Eyes 2, we're to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise, but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert.
0.78 	 Though the films aren't nearly comparable, I kept imagining these "soldiers" being in Platoon, and shuddering with dread.<br /><br />Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues: radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations; a Colonel is addresses as "hey, asshole" by a Private.
1.0 	 I think of the soldiers in James Cameron's Aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations.
0.99 	 Fantasy rooted in reality.<br /><br />I try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10, and judge it's strengths and weaknesses from there.
0.99 	 You have to allow concessions for the material; there's no way Star Wars is as good of a movie as The Godfather, on equal terms.
0.72 	 On a technical side, the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective.
0.85 	 Scenes that are intended to shock, or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work.
0.59 	 I read the title, saw that it came on in the middle of the night, and figured it was one of those soft porn movies.
0.97 	 James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hammy kid actress, and a cheesy title in a John Hughes formula.
0.99 	 But, I got caught up watching it while wasting away a Sunday afternoon, and it hits me on a couple of levels.
0.99 	 Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
0.77 	 This movie has recieved horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like Dude Wheres my Car and Dumb and Dumber this movie is for you.
0.99 	 The only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists.
0.99 	 So i dont know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere.
0.93 	 I still have it taped from when it was first on, you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping.
0.96 	 this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know.
0.51 	 I just saw this movie yesterday...I cannot believe the reviews on this site.
0.56 	 The ones that give it over one-star must be Buffy fanatics.
0.95 	 I ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act, but I was having too much fun with my friends doing MST3K riffs to turn it off.
0.65 	 Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful movies, if even listing "Scooby Doo" on your resume could count.
0.96 	 Did the movie-makers even preview this before they released it?
0.99 	 This type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero.
0.98 	 I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.<br /><br />Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead.
1.0 	 The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views.
0.78 	 If there ever was a time when Towelhead's white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's long past.<br /><br />For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online.
1.0 	 As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you'll frequently come across superlatives: "stunning," "breathtaking," "profound," "shocking," ...
0.99 	 Indeed, I've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight.
0.95 	 If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it.
0.83 	 On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass on this one.
0.98 	 First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time.
0.77 	 This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all.
0.81 	 In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young.
0.98 	 This is just one major example how the book and movie are different.
0.63 	 Who doesn't have unresolved issues with parents?
0.99 	 I was not disappointed!
0.63 	 It seems that Stephen King films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones.
0.7 	 It is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( I only say this for Rachel , and Ellie .. she was so whinny ) I liked everyone else a lot.. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel.
0.99 	 Thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.<br /><br />The story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window.
0.99 	 There is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.<br /><br />Normally I only like Will Smith when is in full Bad Boys mode.
1.0 	 The guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a Ford GT and saying "Aw Hell Nah" as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an Oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for.
1.0 	 Imagine you're a high-school boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend.
0.96 	 (Thank you, Idris Muhammed.)
1.0 	 To gather a group of musicians from America and Europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery, back to their roots in the music of West Africa, and a concert in the old slave fort of GorÃ©e off the coast of Senegal.
1.0 	 We are treated to gospel, blues, jazz and variations of these, including some fantastic drumming both in New Orleans and Senegal.
0.53 	 There's also a good deal of N'Dour's own compositions.<br /><br />Sadly, that's another weakness.
0.98 	 It's never entirely clear what N'Dour himself wants to achieve.
1.0 	 He wants to play his own music, jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires.
0.94 	 He's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the Curator of the GorÃ©e museum.<br /><br />The clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places.
0.97 	 For example, somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir, but N'Dour and most of his mates are Moslems (a point made repeatedly throughout the film).
0.63 	 The whole early sequence involving the black Christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group (the only black Christians who can hold a tone?)
0.74 	 turn up in Dakar at the end of the film.
0.99 	 (To be fair, they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film.)
0.98 	 If the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel, why not also in the direction of Latin America?
0.99 	 Where are the black musical influences from the Caribbean and Brazil?
0.8 	 Samba?
0.96 	 Reggae?
0.72 	 Then there's Europe.
0.99 	 Are they in the team just because N'Dour has played with him before?
0.86 	 Leroi Jones).
0.71 	 And why do they think Arabic Islam is so much more admirable than European Christianity?
0.9 	 Who do they think established the trade in African slaves in the first place?
0.98 	 The Senegalese appear to be a poor but happy, musical gifted folk, friendly and welcoming, respectful of their elders (and not above fleecing the visiting Americans in the fish market).
0.71 	 Is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination?
0.81 	 There is no comment on the armed guard that N'Dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of Dakar.<br /><br />There is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from Dakar came from Dakar.
1.0 	 The similarity between the folk drumming style of New Orleans and the folk drumming style of Senegal is cited in evidence.
0.99 	 The last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland, bidding them farewell.
0.69 	 Except, of course, that by and large, the slaves shipped from Dakar did not come from Dakar.
0.95 	 They were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal Senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever European power currently held the GorÃ©e slave fort.
0.87 	 The people of Dakar are not the descendents of Africans who escaped the slave trade, they are just as likely Â more likely Â to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile.<br /><br />The two agenda's clash again in the final part of the film.
0.71 	 There are two separate endings.
0.82 	 On the one hand, the concert which N'Dour and Co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the GorÃ©e slave fort.
0.99 	 The other end comes when the Harmony Harmoneers sing the spiritual "Return to Glory", in the seaward doorway of the slave fort.
0.94 	 This is deeply moving, even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears.<br /><br />This is a film that is flawed.
0.51 	 Unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions.
1.0 	 Irritating, confusing, beautiful and emotional by turns.
0.57 	 Watch it (listen to it) for the music and the feeling, but don't expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour.
0.58 	 I can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over.
0.94 	 It is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did.
0.99 	 The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly.
0.72 	 I could have kept watching for hours.
0.81 	 The kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land, she must be rich.
0.9 	 Her lie causes much sorrow.<br /><br />Shin-ae becomes a church-goer and wants to forgive the murderer.
0.51 	 She decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him.
0.79 	 Do you have to go to the prison?"
0.99 	 She says, "How could You forgive the man before I forgive?"
0.96 	 She looks up to the sky and proclaims, "I won't lose to You."
0.96 	 While she cuts Shin-ae's hair, the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly.<br /><br />It is difficult not to talk about Jong-chan in the movie.
0.97 	 Although Shin-ae doesn't care about him at all, he is beside her all the time.
0.6 	 Lee Chang-dong, the director of Secret Sunshine, says that Jong-chan is like Milyang( secret sunshine), the rural city or vice versa.
0.73 	 He seems to "be too secular and frivolous, but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her.
0.54 	 I think that he could be the angel.
0.96 	 We can't say for sure that there is no angel."
0.92 	 The life of Shin-ae is full of meaninglessness.
0.91 	 And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayÂand that makes her crazy, literally.
0.76 	 We see Jong-chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair.
0.99 	 With a shallow interpretation of the movie, people misunderstand Christianity and its theology.
1.0 	 Why they don't show on cable or make it available on video, no idea.. Too bad.
1.0 	 - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects.
0.65 	 However, it is just the same special effect done over and over again, and by the end of the film that has been done to death also.
0.73 	 I tell you the people, I watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times.
0.55 	 I was hooked.
0.78 	 Over and over and over.
0.82 	 And over.<br /><br />"Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo."
0.61 	 The rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft.
0.89 	 "doot de doot, de doo de dodedo.
0.99 	 This entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.<br /><br />The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground.
0.72 	 Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot.
0.8 	 Like "The Harvey Girls."
0.96 	 No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable.<br /><br />It starts with patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck, that she must maintain the family name and home.<br /><br />We thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale.
0.83 	 And it is, for a brief time.
0.93 	 Then it turns into the story of cold-hearted Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent.
0.67 	 As we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck, she had once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters as well as herself, of course) by marrying.
0.94 	 They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together, he was conceived.<br /><br />One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young.
1.0 	 I had received an E-Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie.
1.0 	 It was neither great nor inspirational.
0.82 	 A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about.
0.55 	 Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched.
0.77 	 The relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear.
1.0 	 Also the whole movie has most him one way, and then all of a sudden BAM, he is cured and inspiring people.
0.92 	 Thumbs Down.
0.99 	 Its a story thats been told before, but not like this.
0.86 	 There are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be.
0.64 	 At times witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card can be, the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film.
0.67 	 In fifty years we will have the proof.
0.99 	 But this must've been the best part.
0.75 	 This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies.
0.82 	 And yes...they surround her!
0.51 	 AHAHHAHAHAHA!
0.8 	 !<br /><br />This is must-see TV.
0.66 	 <br /><br />
0.93 	 I saw "Shiner" on DVD.
0.84 	 I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has some real issues."
0.98 	 Then I watched the director/writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature.
0.99 	 This is in LA, mind you.
0.99 	 Thank goodness for that.
0.86 	 The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes.
0.52 	 I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it.
1.0 	 That children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over.
0.91 	 Others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of Laurel and Hardy to which I would respond: so WHAT?
0.95 	 OK, I overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews.
0.73 	 I didn't laugh out loud, but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point.
0.94 	 It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten, clichÃ©d line and make it sound vaguely believable.
0.7 	 Try it, especially if you're not a monster fan.
0.97 	 This is NOT a horror flick.
0.98 	 As the sly tailor, Robert Morse hasn't an ounce of charm.
0.99 	 Lysette Anthony is pretty as the emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players.
0.65 	 Hans Christian Andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared.
0.91 	 Sex can be okay; it can even make the movie (hence Karma Sutra) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy.
0.98 	 Despite being ineffably moved by the film, many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non-committal in their writing.
0.98 	 Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition.<br /><br />"My word!"
0.98 	 I muttered under my breath.
0.63 	 It was, in fact, a cunning examination of one common human foible: How little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us.<br /><br />Now, the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid, but lacked innovation.
0.99 	 That's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap, I guess.
0.54 	 One which avoids detection, but affects you deeply.
0.99 	 And proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex, thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousand-seater cinema hall.<br /><br />Now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about.
0.74 	 This film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed...before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental.
0.61 	 She dreams of going out and finding men, having sex with them and eventually killing them.
0.96 	 It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot, and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice.
0.54 	 There's plenty of better stuff than this out there, and while the title may sound intriguing - the film isn't.
0.92 	 The short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so.
0.97 	 At this stage of her career Bergman couldn't get arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward.
0.95 	 In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing.
0.65 	 You couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash in place of The Ramones, it just wouldn't have been the same.
1.0 	 Not the sissy new crap...but the loud, and fast kind.
0.76 	 The kind only The Ramones could do.
0.99 	 I'm a big mark for the music of Neil Young, and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt-indie press circles, hit the first showing of Greendale I could find.
1.0 	 Not the best way to craft a story.
0.83 	 The only kudos I can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast, but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it.
0.72 	 It all goes downhill from there.
0.94 	 Crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen.
0.75 	 Ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye.
0.96 	 While others may contend that by viewing other works by Bilal, one will better appreciate this movie, it does fail in one major way.
0.61 	 It does not stand on its own.
0.85 	 Then craft symbolism around it.
0.7 	 Unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive (which it is,) but at the expense of motivic development.
0.8 	 I would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture.
0.96 	 Granted, it's Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not.
0.85 	 Often during character's interacting, it's nearly difficult to distinguish who's lines are who's.
0.64 	 Certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic, literary lines.<br /><br />It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1, although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget.
0.51 	 1/10
0.98 	 I didn't know what to expect, I'd not read much about it as I knew I would see it no matter what.
0.99 	 It doesn't focus on the generalization of "Anti-War" statements, which to me, left the politics out of it.
0.98 	 Make no mistake - this is not an anti-war film.
0.74 	 However, this film differs quite drastically from the typical Nunsploitation flicks from the time, as it doesn't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc.
0.99 	 Personally, I saw more similarities to the Hexploitation flicks of the time, such as "Mark of The Devil", (even though this one doesn't treat the topic of witch-hunts), which focus on the brutal execution of Christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period.<br /><br />Italy around 1600: After witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded Muslim soldier, young Flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent.
0.71 	 The many torture- and execution-scenes are extremely disturbing, with skinnings, spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail, the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film.
1.0 	 The violence here is never superfluous, however.
0.59 	 The film has some minor inconsistencies (E.g.
0.98 	 why does the rigid church let bizarre cult-followers into convents in the first place).
0.98 	 I watched this movie for a project on love.
0.96 	 please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character, and then re-read the lines he's saying.
1.0 	 And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone.
0.8 	 Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh.
1.0 	 Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job.
0.6 	 I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie.
0.8 	 It is not a strict romantic.
0.83 	 Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time.
0.98 	 During their research, they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies.<br /><br />Anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom.
0.76 	 It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way, it results in awesomely dire entertainment.
1.0 	 A realistic view of Life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time.<br /><br />Given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of Life, at times.
0.73 	 It's not even close to American Pie or Something about Mary as previous comments might have you believe.
0.97 	 Henry Jaglom did better with Eating which suited his style much more.
0.95 	 Mean-spirited, ugly, nasty retro-action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!
0.93 	 ), the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect.
0.82 	 This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere.
0.8 	 Director Scott doesn't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film's dramatic structure.
0.97 	 Scott is either not aware or doesn't care for 30 years of social advances.
0.95 	 I gave this a four purely out of its historical context.
0.58 	 It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties.<br /><br />Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo.
0.87 	 Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers.
0.97 	 I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy.
0.9 	 The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clichÃ©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated.
0.85 	 "Ethnic" jokes are now totally verboten, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
0.92 	 To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it.
0.95 	 No preconception.
0.97 	 I thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something.
0.98 	 I was wrong, kinda.<br /><br />Loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me.
0.99 	 I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to do.<br /><br />Another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but I beg to differ.
0.99 	 I'm sorry but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are "implausible".
0.83 	 Really sorry but the reality of the WORLD is that they DO happen.
1.0 	 I loved S1, I liked season 2, season 3 was OK, and loved the final one.
0.83 	 Yay, there is a spin-off show!
0.89 	 I didn't know about this at all, one of my friends told me about this.
0.9 	 At the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a Cylon.
0.8 	 Who cares this?
0.66 	 Did they decide that the next show's target audience will be females under 18?
1.0 	 On paper, this movie would sound incredibly boring.
0.93 	 She's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out.
0.89 	 He had them each take a stick and break it, which they could easily do.
0.84 	 Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them.
0.85 	 This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller.
0.98 	 In the original, Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols).
0.78 	 In this one, it's, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age.
0.88 	 We're lookin' at the next step in evolution, folks!
0.96 	 Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges).
0.98 	 But, though he takes a lickin', he keeps on kickin'!
0.91 	 I can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film's link with the Eighties but I really wouldn't say it's an accurate depiction of most peoples' lives in that era - even on the poorest Bradford estates.
1.0 	 IThe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you'll find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in 'Gregory's Girl'.
0.99 	 Steer clear my friends.
0.59 	 it isn't..but it is grim.
1.0 	 The story is very trustworthy and powerful.
1.0 	 Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best.
0.99 	 The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role.
0.77 	 But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.
0.89 	 Someone by the name of "Eddie Izzard" was on.I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes.
0.62 	 After holding in my laughs for more than was healthful, I let go--as did the others of us(we were not stoned, by the way, nor talking of insurance and pensions...).
0.98 	 We were asphyxiated after that.
1.0 	 Disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (sounds pervy, I'm not!)
0.99 	 My conclusion: let's stick to the classics!
0.54 	 Well, it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either.
0.97 	 This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco.
0.95 	 The city, renowned for its beauty, has rarely appeared uglier than in this film.
0.79 	 Actually, I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?)
1.0 	 She's interesting, though not necessarily convincing.<br /><br />Highlights: the film's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist, Ron Athey.
0.93 	 A boy who is forced to become a man, because of the system.
0.95 	 A movie you can't hide from.
0.79 	 Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can't do anything, and a boy with, I am sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept things, who will not let anything happen to him, a kid with power, and a kid who acts like a pro, like he has never done anything else, he caries this movie to the end, and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the 60'ies.
0.7 	 Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.
0.54 	 It's not funny.
0.58 	 The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it.
0.6 	 And that's truly something.
0.98 	 Congratulations in advance!
0.93 	 Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation.
0.8 	 It's Neil Simon's humorous material that's key, and where the laughs really originate from.<br /><br />For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau).
0.79 	 some people have complained that this show lacked a moral center because in the first (and several subsequent) episodes Ned seems to get away with causing the death of Chuck's father without consequences of any kind.
0.56 	 First of all, this must be a new definition of "without consequences of any kind" because, in spite of the fact that Ned was only a boy and did not realize that he had caused the death of Chuck's father, he nevertheless felt guilty from the moment he realized what he had done.
0.71 	 Now, there are no police to charge people with magically causing one person's death by bringing another person back to life, so the questions of absolution and restitution have to be taken up without societal guidance.
0.81 	 In other words, it's between Ned and Chuck, who was not inclined to forgive Ned anytime soon.<br /><br />But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas.
0.87 	 I remember when David Caruso's character on "NYPD Blue" did something wrong and it seemed he got away with it--for a whole year--then he got caught and was forced to resign from the job (and left the show).
0.98 	 I'd really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account.
0.74 	 I watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration.<br /><br />The acting was very, very good, but that was about it.
0.87 	 During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal.
0.98 	 His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different.
0.71 	 I can keep up with films like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other films that have flashbacks/flash-forwards left and right, but CU didn't capture and hold onto the style.
0.78 	 At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries.
0.55 	 CU just leaves you hanging.
0.51 	 It's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing.<br /><br />Good acting, like I said.
0.91 	 Lots of setting shots of the Seattle Space Needle necessary to disguise the obvious Canadian shooting locale.

0.93 	 Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate.

0.79 	 That's a good point in and of itself.
0.89 	 Unfortunately, his intellect isn't up to the task.<br /><br />Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box.
0.85 	 <br /><br />Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it.

0.91 	 Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really?
0.64 	 The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie.
0.8 	 Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" (guilty pleasure of mine) and "Plague".
1.0 	 The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator.
1.0 	 A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent
 She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her "masterpiece".
0.99 	 In her debut, she was credited as 'runaway model' and in "3 men and a baby", her character is referred to as 'one of Jack's girls'.
0.99 	 The best part is that I couldn't stop thinking of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern.
0.6 	 The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed $22 million in the box office and only cost about $1.5 million to make.

0.79 	 If you want a good ape movie watch the original.<br /><br />**out of****stars
0.86 	 To then pick another fight with another infected host!
0.78 	 It is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty, with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons, i.e saws, drills, blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent.
0.79 	 I found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!<br /><br />So if you like gore, you like aliens, you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere, then i must recommend this film as a must see.
0.92 	 I just wish i came across this earlier then i did!
0.73 	 Why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime.
0.51 	 "Conan" is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better.
0.84 	 This is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style.
0.93 	 Turn your backs away or you're gonna get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK!
1.0 	 Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you're watching this.
0.97 	 Without a feeling of sorrow, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he's dead.
0.51 	 "Living" is a coincidence.
0.74 	 Blah!!
0.51 	 !
0.8 	 I imagine Davis' fans of "Of Human Bondage" who agree with the Oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critique's contrast of the 1934 film for which the AFI didn't award her performance & the 1936 film "Dangerous," performance for which she received her 1st Oscar in 1937.<br /><br />I've tried to view all of Bette Davis' motion pictures, TV interviews, videos, advertisements for WWII & TV performances in popular series.
0.94 	 She was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach Hollywood's red carpet.
0.6 	 Even Anna Nicole Smith was a 'star'.
0.9 	 There are rarely private detectives in his work - just losers, psychotics and small-time con artists.
0.98 	 This film has Thompson nailed - "If God made any real mistakes in this world, it was in giving us a will to live when we've got no excuse for it."
0.99 	 This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be my last.
0.88 	 The final scenes are utterly unbelievable.
0.9 	 You know: you get into your car and you immediately start thinking,"Gosh, I hope today isn't the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph, all four door latches break in the locked position, both my main and emergency brake fail, my ignition switch can't be turned off, and I've got a full tank of gas; all simultaneously."
0.96 	 Fortunately, for most of us, our Thorazine kicks-in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car.
0.97 	 If she is to represent a land that is not Africa, how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not African?
0.98 	 She's not the only American on the cast; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose.
0.89 	 Both women are far, far too young for the roles they're playing, and far too glamorous.
1.0 	 Scott's Mma Ramotswe is bouncy, cute and soft.
0.72 	 The principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who turns in a decent performance as Mr JLB Matekoni.
0.74 	 The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script.<br /><br />To me, McCall Smith's writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad.
1.0 	 Characters speak of "opening up" and "sensitivity to needs".
0.92 	 Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly.
0.56 	 It reads well despite linguistic travesty, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were.
0.96 	 It remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice, however.
0.92 	 Who can really relate to this?
0.91 	 Who lives like these characters?
0.96 	 There are some talented young actors in this "film" that have done a good job elsewhere.
0.95 	 The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films.
0.79 	 It really is that offensive to the genre.
0.54 	 This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane!
0.98 	 They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes.
0.91 	 Can't be coincidence.
0.7 	 <br /><br />The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending.
0.54 	 Jeremy Isaacs says in "The Making of The World at War" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants.
0.52 	 The most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to Isaacs, was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff.
0.78 	 The other is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously.
0.96 	 Having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'Husbands' came as a pleasant surprise.
0.83 	 Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is.
0.68 	 I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer.
0.59 	 This movie is like that impressionist painting.
0.98 	 And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.<br /><br />This is not your typical linear plot.
0.85 	 There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on.
0.62 	 But at the end, all is explained.<br /><br />You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it.
0.59 	 If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it.<br /><br />But if you DO like what I described, then you will surely enjoy it.
1.0 	 Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek.
1.0 	 This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others.
0.55 	 And then: Orang Utans in Africa?<br /><br />But it has a few things going for it.
1.0 	 Bo looks great, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.)
1.0 	 are quite good, and this greatly enhances its camp value.
0.94 	 Otherwise, I don't think I could recommend it.
0.97 	 I was blown away.
0.63 	 After I watched this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared it to Lost In Translation LITE.
0.99 	 Interestingly, the format of the movie is nearly identical, but the PACING is incredibly different.
0.67 	 "10 Items" rushes the viewer through the 1-day time line of the movie, whereas the better-planned "Lost In..." seems to stretch out over a few long days.<br /><br />I'm sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed.
0.99 	 It seems his better roles now-a-days are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in sub-$10mil limited release movies and indie films.
0.75 	 There's gobs of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and references to big belt-buckles and rodeos.
0.94 	 "Hamlet" it's not.
1.0 	 But, the cinematography seemed weak.
0.94 	 The film copy I watched was grainy, and at times suffered from a reddish/orange tint, a visual trait I have noticed in other films from the same time period.<br /><br />At first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message".
0.82 	 John Thaw, of Inspector Morse fame, plays old Tom Oakley in this movie.
0.57 	 Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face".<br /><br />Two points of interest.
0.65 	 Also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool.<br /><br />overall score ********** out of **********
0.94 	 Some of the girls meet up with a dude, who is apparently a currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they look normal to him apparently).
0.53 	 It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel!
1.0 	 Englund plays the well known Marque De Sade who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession of pain and the pleasure of bringing pain upon himself as well as watching others also be in pain.
0.9 	 All I saw was a young lady that became entrapped by a strange lesbian who desides to keep her to herself and the young lady became fascinated by this Arabian with alot of money and finds out that he's out to have her killed and then Englund steps in from one century to another claiming to be a descendent of the de Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of the Madam Momoselle(spelled that wrong) or whoever it was in the picture above De Sades wall.
0.78 	 Englund tries to make a comeback from his once hit move "Nightmare on Elm St." by using these pull in and out needles to put out peoples eyes.
0.97 	 Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role.
0.98 	 Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold.
0.74 	 Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her).
0.69 	 As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim.
0.96 	 Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point?
0.97 	 The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain.
0.56 	 Gary Busey is know for his "B" movies, but this is a sure "W" movie.
0.79 	 (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer.
0.81 	 Inside the jeep is MA and is "confused" as to why all the cops are about.
0.99 	 Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off.
0.67 	 The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet.
0.82 	 MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough.
0.88 	 For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10.
0.62 	 This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time.<br /><br />Plot- A family without a mother and 3 "dads" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.<br /><br />Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie.
1.0 	 The end is rather weird, so be prepared for it, it is slightly boring.
0.61 	 Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen.
0.86 	 Goodie gooodie, clap clap, what a twist.
0.86 	 Oh, another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify x,y,z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time it is 3 letters, each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values.
0.63 	 Directors/writers should be required to possess some talent.
0.99 	 The cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck.
0.51 	 It predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist.
0.97 	 There's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough T&A from a couple of the girls to please T&A fans.
1.0 	 The Hanzo 'plot' was kinda getting stale and repetitive.
0.99 	 What was once novel in the first film, was not any longer.
0.97 	 !Although I have not seen the remake,I feel already that it was TOTALLY unnecessary.I think Rob Zombie should have NEVER remade such a classic.What kills me though,is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original.I am getting furious just thinking about it!!!!!
0.91 	 ***SPOILERS*** Like some evil Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double-play combination we have in "Omen IV" the evil seed of the deceased AntiChrist Damien Thorn come back.
1.0 	 Terrorizing his parents his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the entire world as a she named Delia York, Asia Vieila.
0.8 	 Later Delia almost get killed by a runaway truck only to have herself saved by this "Devil Dog" named Ryder.
0.87 	 Going to school Delia takes care of the local bully by getting the big guy to wet himself in front of all his classmates.
0.71 	 Later when his father threatens the Yorks with a law suit she has his head sliced off in a self-induced traffic accident!
0.95 	 Did his bratty and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York's sudden good fortune?<br /><br />It's only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny that the truth's comes out about her strange and evil powers.
0.99 	 Jo a New Age type realizes that Delia is a bit weird, after turning all her white crystals black, and calls her New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come over and check her out.
0.73 	 The and shaken and battered Guru was so shook up by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan wilderness.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Jo herself is later thrown out, with the help of the sweet and cuddly family pet Ryder, of a second floor window to her death because she knew and talked too much.
0.8 	 It's when Karen is again pregnant that she decides, finally, to find out the truth about the real parents of Delia.
0.84 	 That's when she,and we in the audience, come face to face with the truth.
0.71 	 Her brother the AntiChrist himself is about to come on the scene as her kid brother the sill unborn Alexander York!<br /><br />Three times were more then enough for the AntiChrist coming back to earth to bring about Armageddon.
0.86 	 The movie going public were already getting a little tired of of him and his evil adventures.
0.98 	 You could see the surprise ending coming almost as soon as the film "Omen IV" began with the bases being cleared for Delia's eventual takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world.
0.97 	 What was a bit of a surprise was Delia doing it with a little help from friends.
0.83 	 Forget that this is a "B" movie.
0.98 	 Forget that it is in many ways outdated.
0.53 	 Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS.
0.98 	 Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
0.95 	 Don't expect more, you won't find it.
0.9 	 Take one look at the cover of this movie, and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film.
0.96 	 This is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments.
0.85 	 For a made-for-TV "horror" movie the movie started off very interesting.
0.91 	 I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film.
0.73 	 This film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it.
0.87 	 In fact, I recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching Showgirls.<br /><br />Out of 400 votes, the movie gets a user rating of 5.3/10.
0.94 	 Chuck Murdock is an all-star little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons.
1.0 	 Soon "Amazing Grace" Smith is an all-star Boston Celtic who is inspired by Chuck's story and gives up basketball.
0.93 	 Soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a world-wide protest.
0.75 	 Later all the children of the world go on a silence strike.
1.0 	 This inspires the President of the United States to meet with the Soviet Premier, who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next Little League season.
0.94 	 The movie ends with Chuck about to throw out the first pitch, with the President telling his new best friend Chuck not to worry about striking out every batter, as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills Amazing Grace.
0.94 	 It was on television from 2:30 am to 4:00 am, and I watched it all.
0.94 	 I don't even understand why "Amazing Grace" Smith was killed.
1.0 	 And with all these famous athletes becoming Chuck's friends, why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand.
0.96 	 Cue hug.
0.77 	 This movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would-be librarians.
0.94 	 It also breaks many librarian stereotypes.
0.71 	 From the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like its a movie about another Jason's from Friday the 13th.
0.94 	 And It is... Dispute that the movie starts interesting.
0.95 	 Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults, and also fails to entertain despite the oh-so-cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans.
0.99 	 After looking past the wonderful animations, what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess.<br /><br />Spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful, as he is a horse that cannot be tamed, calmed, nor controlled.
0.95 	 Because of this, he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high-spirited horses, which includes his mom.
0.98 	 But, his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of Americans in the process of connecting the Wild West with the rest of the country.
0.87 	 During this, Spirit (never actually named that throughout the entire film almost) befriends a courageous Native American, and a fellow female horse, and also has a lot of run-ins with the cynical and cruel Army folks that apparently don't believe in giving up.<br /><br />Why must movies mix computer animation with traditional?
0.99 	 It comes off looking rather meshed, something Spirited Away suffered from as well.
0.99 	 Best example is when a train is chasing after Spirit; you see the hand-drawn Spirit running from a computer-animated train.
0.77 	 It would look much better if it were one or the other, but not both; unless you can really pull off some nice effects.
0.74 	 Beauty and The Beast's famous dance sequence uses computer animation, but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie.
0.73 	 While Disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals, they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one.
0.68 	 Bryan Adams has no place in this movie, and why does Hans Zimmer stay away from using a Western theme in this movie, when it is a story taking place in the Old West?
0.94 	 Yet, if you are going to refrain from making horses talk, why even have a narrator interrupt every so often, which just so happens to be the main character himself?<br /><br />Native Americans are nice, and the Western folks are evil, Native-killing, horse torturing, rowdy, psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed.
1.0 	 More or less, this is what Spirit is showing us.
1.0 	 This film gets quite rhythmic, as we see in multiple instances Spirit escaping from chains, kicking people around, destroying property, freeing horses, and then getting captured again---all in this same order too.
0.94 	 Kill Bill Vol.
0.99 	 Thank you.
0.78 	 The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.<br /><br />My advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.<br /><br />In todays climate of TV Media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom.
0.79 	 Forget that though!
0.98 	 You will too unless you're a thesp.
0.75 	 For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas.
0.99 	 God may be a judge, but I don't think He is going to measure every level of goodness.
0.99 	 Give the Creator some credit.
0.97 	 I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese.
0.97 	 And why not?
0.74 	 Well, OK, not really, but this movie is a winner.<br /><br />Elizabeth (Dench) spends the whole film trying to reunite the Blonde Bombshells to play at her granddaughter's school dance.
0.83 	 Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television.
0.67 	 From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery.
0.99 	 The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.
0.75 	 Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "Hollywood" the hell out of it when all it needed was good, smart story telling?
0.77 	 The only downside is that i really didn't understand how Dooley's wife died.
0.74 	 She died before this movie but how?
0.91 	 If they said it i must have missed it.
0.61 	 Other than that I give it two thumbs/tails up!
0.51 	 They were so funny and all the noises Jerry Lee would make when Dooley was talking to him was so funny.
0.98 	 Certainly in the top ten of those I've watched all the way through.
0.92 	 At least "Plan 9" was enjoyable.<br /><br />I DID really enjoy "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie", and some of his other films.
0.95 	 When the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "the part of a lifetime" by the neo-Nazi head of the secret service.
0.98 	 A Pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum which causes invisibility but when the lead boffin tries it out on himself he can't reverse the process.
0.93 	 Wells tradition.<br /><br />This is a gleefully horrible Invisible Man story, delivered with relish by the ever-tasteful Verhoeven and Bacon as the genius-turned-loonytoon-maniac.
0.86 	 The movie within the movie - a concept done many times in the history of cinema.
0.87 	 <br /><br />Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time.
1.0 	 Horrible.<br /><br />You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's ONLY holes - and the excitement factor?
0.93 	 I was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and seen a movie that had not been advertised.
0.65 	 I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it.
0.85 	 Having watched "Mad about you", once, I was not a fan of Paul Reiser.
0.9 	 However, I am a big fan of Peter Falk.
0.99 	 Not that sappy emoted junk, but real life situations from real life-like people.
0.74 	 I don't know where this movie has gone.
0.54 	 I heard it was put out in limited release.
0.52 	 M.
0.99 	 In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often.
0.64 	 Once again he has assembled an impressive cast (Like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman)that this time around to the letter is miscast.
0.67 	 But that's only part of the problem.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad.
0.72 	 The female leads (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen)are lean leggy and unemotive.
1.0 	 It lacks his offbeat touches and observations (he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia)that make a well done Altman so unique.
0.99 	 These are of course not quoted from the film, but generalities.
0.86 	 Some answers are not.
0.93 	 This movie does not answer them for; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers.<br /><br />
0.95 	 And that's the only negative comment I have on this film.
0.98 	 It's sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for one film.
0.86 	 Not pretty American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time.
0.58 	 That makes the film realistic, even when the story is not that convincing.
0.97 	 In other words, if somebody falls down, he makes a "falling down" sound in the orchestra, etc., etc...If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative, I couldn't be unhappier about the results...Just before I left to go abroad, I asked Vi (Viola Lawrence, the editor) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue.
0.92 	 Instead, the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony: a pratfall by Pluto the Pup, or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck...There is no sound atmosphere on the boat.
0.9 	 A little wind and water is sorely missed.
0.97 	 There's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen...At the start of the picnic sequence...in the temporary score, we used a very curious, sexy Latin-American strain...This has been replaced with a corny "dramatic" sequel--bad stock stuff...This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit...There is a big musical outburst after Grigsby's line, "I want you to kill him."
0.99 	 This is absurd...The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio...was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point.
0.89 	 Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we're kidding...The aquarium scene needs more echo.
1.0 	 "Please Don't Kiss Me" is in again!...A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michael's run down the pier.
0.81 	 From the gunshot through to the phone call, a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort.
1.0 	 For some reason, this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo.
1.0 	 As a result, the whole sequence seems dull...The audience should feel at this point, along with Michael, that maybe they are going crazy.
0.86 	 The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they're going to sleep...The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music...The closing music again makes reference to "Please Don't Kiss Me"...This finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity, and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture.
0.97 	 "<br /><br />All of these edits from Orson were ignored
0.62 	 I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 Sept 2009).
0.96 	 It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son, to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate.
0.91 	 Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack, even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity, and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams.
0.95 	 But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough.
0.97 	 Also, those who didn't like Evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable.
0.65 	 In fact, the show has several little "Science Lesson" interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie.
0.8 	 Be warned, this show is heavy on the sap at times.
0.99 	 It also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that I have ever seen.
0.66 	 I found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one.
0.6 	 However, they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway.
0.67 	 The ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut I couldn't help but love it.
0.99 	 Shocking!<br /><br />In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive.
1.0 	 He was sincere, unpretentious and kindly, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person.
0.97 	 The real Gagarin was someone else!
0.94 	 A lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated.
0.88 	 The dubbers seem to be American fans (penpals of the Germans?!)
0.66 	 True, it might be the traditional "clothing style" of the African (?)
0.9 	 The movie I had wanted was gone, so I rented this instead, not expecting much, and was very much surprised with how good it was.
0.96 	 From the little I know about the man and his story, liberties have been taken with the facts, but it's a movie, not a textbook, and so the filmmakers can be excused.
0.77 	 But, his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest.
0.91 	 Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis, and Mary, his wife, suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham, a smarmy Englishman with no soul.
0.87 	 Honestly, this man is like ice cream: even when he's bad he's good.
0.75 	 Jessica Lange, as Mary, gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering, dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure.
0.98 	 You just know she doesn't take any b.s from Rob, or anyone else for that matter.
0.94 	 We grow good wine.
1.0 	 Our writers and poets are among the world's best.
1.0 	 The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world.
0.77 	 photography.
0.99 	 And if the movie was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the "plot") why in God's name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle???
1.0 	 The Australians turn out some splendid stuff.
0.51 	 !
0.6 	 This movie shows it, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about Art, especially naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral.
0.99 	 Even so Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked.
0.96 	 He said that he raped her, but it wasn't true.
0.96 	 Found this flick in a videostore, it cost $2 to buy.
1.0 	 The whole movie stinks really bad!
0.82 	 The so-called colonel, who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted, must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk.
0.51 	 I got lost a hundred times but didn't mind, because the movie is so bad, it's real fun to watch.
0.98 	 Zero-Budget trash with actors not deserving that name.
0.63 	 Go check it out!
0.99 	 But interference on some level(for starters, several of the scenes in the original trailer don't appear in the movie) and changing of tone(subsequent trailers make it look like a thriller) make this, while watchable, nowhere near as it could have been.<br /><br />Which is too bad, because I really wanted to like this movie.
0.93 	 But Fonda is wasted in her role, having nothing to do, and while there is merit in the central storyline, when it turns to a thriller, the movie loses its way, briefly recovers in the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely in the end.
0.99 	 I wish I could like this more, but no.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Why see this film?
0.56 	 It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes: the frisky male bonding in the after-game showers; Karen Black's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it's the first use of a word I hadn't witnessed in film before; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall.
0.5 	 You'll see why.
1.0 	 I worried about seeing a bad movie.
1.0 	 Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />I don't consider this a bad movie.
0.92 	 Just a rather well made horror movie.
0.86 	 It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music.
0.73 	 The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko.<br /><br />The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the Japanese original).<br /><br />The scary moments were often predictable.
0.59 	 But not always.
0.91 	 I have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice.
0.87 	 It's a good horror movie, enough suspense.
0.64 	 I gave it a 7.
0.93 	 Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films.
0.52 	 This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula.
0.68 	 With the Moto films, they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled.
0.8 	 And, in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears.
0.96 	 Although he's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip.
0.76 	 In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.<br /><br />Overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here.
0.91 	 With WWII approaching, the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the US or in allied countries.
0.98 	 The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets.
0.59 	 Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan.
0.67 	 The film-makers in their (about the film) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around.
0.82 	 Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India.
0.55 	 The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song.
0.97 	 They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song.
0.7 	 How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively.
0.91 	 In present time, the movie is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe).
1.0 	 Peter's renting out his house, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole come to stay there.
0.66 	 Let's see.
0.9 	 Hmmm...it's almost as though she's an exact rip-off of Freddy Krueger from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" films.
0.93 	 R for violence.
0.71 	 'Arthur' is the result.
0.78 	 Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank.
0.99 	 Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role.<br /><br />There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'.
0.88 	 Guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost.
0.77 	 He eventually returned to Britain, dejected and apparently dying.<br /><br />But 'Arthur' is a sample of what might have been.
0.67 	 The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances, but are careful not to overshadow the two leads, a danger in some Christie adaptations.
0.76 	 About the adaptation, it was fairly faithful to the book, but I will say that there were three things I didn't like.
0.99 	 The main problem was the pacing, it is rather slow, and there are some scenes where very little happens.
0.95 	 I didn't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer.
0.99 	 (I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer's next victim.)
0.9 	 On the whole, despite some misjudgements on the writers' behalf, I liked Murder in Mesopotamia.
0.74 	 You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya.
0.82 	 I just wish it were longer.
0.83 	 My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one.
1.0 	 I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us other cult classics such as "Spider Baby".
0.54 	 The print quality is excellent, but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull.
0.96 	 It was actually believable.
0.99 	 or perhaps "Why?"
0.81 	 The movie makes one wonder whether political activism is worth all the trouble because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they don't even know what the fuss is all about.
0.9 	 The morale of this movie is: look out for the friend, he may sell you out for a dime.
0.92 	 The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the Princess?
0.67 	 The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love-struck deposed king is equally improbable.
1.0 	 But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot genies and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme.
0.9 	 Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it?
0.85 	 - No Question!
0.85 	 - No Argument!<br /><br />
0.87 	 The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work.
0.82 	 Admittedly, I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating.
0.97 	 However, in reality, (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.<br /><br />1 star out of ten.
0.95 	 What's not to like about this movie?
0.84 	 Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible.
0.75 	 ***THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILER(S)*** <br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Chuck Norris as an actor, but I worship him in all other ways.
1.0 	 He also have his own fan web site with "Chuck Norris facts" that is really entertaining.
0.99 	 The chief terrorist send his comrades message through the media when he is captured and the only guy smart enough to see the treat is: Chuck Norris, of course.
0.58 	 NO ONE else in America is not smart enough to see that!
0.88 	 If you didn't know, 85% of terrorist are masters of some martial art, but Chuck and CO beat the sh*t out of them.
0.94 	 Because I just wanted to see who, of these two super heroes, will defuse the nuclear bomb of few hundred megatons and size of a MICROWAVE.
0.89 	 Of course, it's Chuck's movie after all.
1.0 	 Forget it.<br /><br />Bing Crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as "Hank Martin."
0.99 	 Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was, too, in addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair.
0.99 	 <br /><br />It's a nice movie with a feel-good ending, and I can't knock that.
0.85 	 Maybe this is worthy of a rental, for historical sake or if you're a big Crosby fan but, overall, it's not that much.
1.0 	 Where to start?<br /><br />THE SCRIPT: I thought I'd be getting a slice of bittersweet Americana.
0.95 	 Check.
0.95 	 Check.
0.95 	 Check.
0.83 	 Double check.
0.91 	 Check.<br /><br />After a while, you realize that what you're watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that.
0.97 	 Scene with Knoxville.
0.95 	 Scene with Ex girlfriend.
0.62 	 Scene with Knoxville which hasn't moved on much.
0.74 	 Scene with Ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one.
0.99 	 Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to get through every scene.
0.73 	 Her performance is a car crash (though what you do with those lines, I don't know).
0.99 	 Have we not moved on since Cheech and Chong?<br /><br />I could go on, but I think you get my drift.
0.97 	 What I would say is that, as other reviews have mentioned, no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work.
0.99 	 The premise of the story is simple: An old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child, and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred.
0.76 	 Though very little dialog is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic.
1.0 	 He has no passion in his play.Also the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic.
0.82 	 <br /><br />I don't understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned from Mexico.
0.9 	 I think this is a mistake in the story.<br /><br />So i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt...
0.78 	 It's NOT about explosions, car chases, or flying bullets.
0.7 	 You must be patient and instead, note the details here.
0.93 	 The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds.<br /><br />I will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching.
0.59 	 I am delighted to say that I have been proved wrong.
0.78 	 So from the travelogue point of view, this film has interest.
1.0 	 The film contains one splendid performance, by a little girl named Perla Haney-Jardine.
1.0 	 She has already made seven films despite being only 12, so she seems determined upon a career as an actress, and judging by her performance in this film, she should go far, as she is a natural and has a great deal of talent.
0.96 	 Colin Firth, a reliable and professional actor, was on hand for the filming and when asked to be earnest, he was earnest, and when asked to be anguished, he was anguished.
1.0 	 Catherine Keener does exceptionally well in a supporting role, and showing sympathy comes naturally to her, so that everybody would like to have her around (I would like to tell her every time I feel a cold coming on, as I know she would get me a soothing hot drink).
1.0 	 So there we have it: Genoa's fascinating narrow alleys, an interesting little girl, and a sympathetic woman.
0.84 	 It's the first time I have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist.
0.8 	 The whole town gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak.
0.98 	 Although the subject matter sounds harsh, the film doesn't exploit sexuality.
0.98 	 That song keeps humming in my head.
1.0 	 Not the greatest song, but it's the 80's.
0.69 	 This movie is about a lead singer who "supposebly" gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band.
0.92 	 The lead singer whos name is Billy "Eye" (yeah, right) is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time.
0.94 	 She sees that he's dead but still see's and hears his voice.
0.53 	 I watch it for the song.
0.82 	 Special effects?
0.75 	 No depth.
0.76 	 In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War.
0.95 	 I cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film, when Superman was, and is, daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds.
0.96 	 That doesn't rule it out however; get a group of lads and some Stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter.
0.95 	 Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs (estate agent???).
0.92 	 Are we really to believe that the ICF (on whom of course the drama is based) would EVER go to another town to fight with just SIX blokes?<br /><br />The ICF would crowd out tube stations and the like with HUNDREDS.
1.0 	 Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature.
0.53 	 The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- Oldman is so camp it is unbelievable.
0.58 	 Most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of Mr Matey.
1.0 	 A true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick- go for it.
1.0 	 This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel.
0.99 	 It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera.
0.7 	 It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome.
0.98 	 Then it rewards the winner money.
0.72 	 If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better.
0.81 	 While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality.
1.0 	 <br /><br />This show has elements of several types of successful past programs.
0.89 	 Reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea.
0.99 	 It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet.
0.92 	 After all, so do re-runs of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch.
0.84 	 The intelligence level is about the same.
0.73 	 This was one of those times.
1.0 	 Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley).
0.69 	 It probably isn't fair that I have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten, but oh well.......<br /><br />From a standpoint of acting, how could any actor fail with these characters?
0.87 	 She is simply put, his savior.
0.9 	 This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series.
0.64 	 Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic.
0.58 	 Until then, I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled.
0.95 	 The background behind this chance, yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding "Ben Gazzara," introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool.
0.86 	 But none of them is true.
0.84 	 Police come and arrested him.
0.98 	 I am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie.
1.0 	 In fact, when I'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies.
0.99 	 They are always good for a laugh, believe i know, i have seen many.
0.97 	 "Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time.
0.74 	 It made very little difference.
0.99 	 Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family.
0.97 	 Some said it was Spanish Harlem.
0.67 	 Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn.
0.98 	 As a life-long New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side.
0.72 	 They lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave.
0.96 	 Some interaction with non-Latinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension.
0.7 	 Remember West Side Story?<br /><br />And now for the oft-criticized cinematography.
0.7 	 The apt, the furniture, and the faces were all ORANGE.
0.94 	 Somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms.
0.57 	 What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them.
0.71 	 Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch?
0.98 	 <br /><br />So "Victor Vargas" is a pleasant little movie.
1.0 	 It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did.
0.98 	 Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the "fast forward" button.
0.5 	 This is not a good movie.
1.0 	 The 3D was OK, but not superb.
0.98 	 Pixar this is not.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more special 3D effects.
0.62 	 Too much love for the music, too much parties, too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director.
0.9 	 Everything looks too fake to me: the families, the relationships, the music, the "happiness".
0.75 	 It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture.
1.0 	 I liked the scene with Caridad's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
0.99 	 This is to the Zatoichi movies as the "Star Trek" movies were to "Star Trek"--except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big, shiny re-do, and also better made, if substance is more important than surface.
0.9 	 Not the same experience at all.
0.94 	 was duly aired, and I -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape.
0.78 	 To this day I can crack up just thinking about the dialog.
0.96 	 I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part in it, and her character isn't very likable.
1.0 	 However, the main character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie.
0.99 	 After a car crash, some friends are possibly dead, but keeps on living their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen.
0.97 	 In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys?<br /><br />3 out of 10.
1.0 	 and i love it !
0.68 	 Richard Dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant.
0.53 	 "Suzanne" the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane "artist" character.
0.75 	 The people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written.
0.88 	 The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine, but WHERES THE EXPERIMENT?
0.76 	 And as for 'earning' prize money, thats fine, if they actually earnt it!
0.58 	 These people are nuts.
0.85 	 If only they would make the show better, the actual idea would be glorious.
0.57 	 for some reason, though, i stayed and watched it 'til the end.
0.99 	 then again she has a soft side that's just looking for love.
0.91 	 The boy has been given money to buy milk.
0.55 	 Next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary.
0.97 	 The boy drops the bottle of milk.
0.83 	 It breaks.
0.95 	 The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk.
0.76 	 The fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl.
0.67 	 The cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath.
0.98 	 The cat drops the fish into the bowl.
0.99 	 The movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing.
0.94 	 And the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups.
0.91 	 While she learns to speak correctly, so does Paulie.
0.63 	 The military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy.
0.95 	 And, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable.
0.96 	 (Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J.
0.96 	 The musical score resembles David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which furthers the Steven Segal theme of this movie.
1.0 	 There is plenty of martial arts in the film, and it is pretty well done for a low budget American production.
0.54 	 <br /><br />Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90's but he is certainly no action star, that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters.
0.75 	 My recommendation is that you skip "CIA Codename:Alexa" and check out "La Femme Nikita" instead.
0.92 	 More TV movies ought to be made like this one.
0.87 	 The director also directed "Hoosiers," which was somehow both formulaic and exciting.
1.0 	 If you like TV movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can.
0.51 	 You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail, and murder, all in one spot!
0.94 	 <br /><br />The lead actors do a credible job.
0.95 	 And, I found the intricately woven plot to be believable and interesting.<br /><br />However, the supporting cast, primarily the bikers, delivers a stilted performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words.
0.98 	 Perhaps they used real bikers, instead of actors.
0.71 	 Oddly enough, this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939.
0.53 	 "A FOP!!
0.9 	 Then Zorro seems trapped at a man-made avalanche intended for the convoy, when, well, you know cliffhanger end of Chapter One.<br /><br />Wow!
0.65 	 There is a number of suspects as to who was really behind of the mask of 'Don del Oro'.
0.95 	 And, incidentally, they wisely choose to not have the actors affect any Mexican accents.<br /><br />As to just what is there here that makes ZFL stand out from the rest?
0.85 	 His costume and especially the elongated mask looked very good and was probably very functional.<br /><br />There is a small slip up.
0.87 	 In actuality, they are called 'States'.
0.91 	 This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as a 9/10.
1.0 	 It's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the Lifetime channel, but put in a horror universe.
0.52 	 It's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half-drunk .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
1.0 	 The only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they didn't.<br /><br />The mix of both is mixed.
0.73 	 There were moments of utter genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas.
0.63 	 I just can't say it was perfect, or even near it, because of the lack of originality to the plot.<br /><br />A GREAT family movie.
1.0 	 A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls).
0.99 	 A great movie to watch with anyone .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.9 	 I don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so.
0.71 	 Different strokes for different folks, I suppose.
0.88 	 I don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine.
0.98 	 Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child .
0.82 	 The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ?
1.0 	 If only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as Orwell said " Ignorance is strength " .
0.8 	 Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life !
0.94 	 And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ?
0.95 	 It seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well.
0.98 	 When he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes Trelkovsky's point of view.
0.94 	 Some psychological thrillers, like M or Peeping Tom, manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist.
0.97 	 Others, like Psycho, attempt in-depth scientific analysis of his mental condition.
0.83 	 Why?
0.87 	 Precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia.
1.0 	 A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper.
1.0 	 Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role.
0.79 	 That's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good.
1.0 	 Years after the fall of the last of the great corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts.
0.78 	 On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs.<br /><br />"Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy.
0.79 	 The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes.
1.0 	 Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes he appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain.
0.76 	 Cinematography was average.
0.96 	 The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular.
0.72 	 Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap-opaeras.
0.99 	 There are many Korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and I always thought it was very stale.
0.98 	 There was no such crap in this movie.<br /><br />Very funny and well-done.
0.85 	 You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.<br /><br />The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are.
0.79 	 Get a copy of this now, you won't regret it!
0.74 	 I give this an 11 out of 10.
0.95 	 They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture.
0.99 	 If you would like to see a real, and I mean a real, genuine documentary from Puerto Rico, then you must see "Mi Puerto Rico".
1.0 	 That's a serious, real documentary.
0.98 	 Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself.
0.87 	 Well, that's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary.
0.9 	 It brings down the standards.
0.9 	 After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll film and I picked out Seed because I happened to stumble on it in a local DVD-store and it's supposed to be one of his better films.<br /><br />While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films I've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting.
0.58 	 It seems like Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it.
0.96 	 There are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone.
0.92 	 But, after I watch it, I didn't get this feeling of "sickness" which I would surely have regarding society rules.
1.0 	 And no moment I though this is immoral.
0.63 	 You even hope it will not break in the end....it cannot break...it's not right.
0.93 	 You feel the pain of being hart broken in the end...<br /><br />But,I need also to add a negative spin to this comment...I don't know if the story is not somehow *showed* to give the feeling that these relations are sick only in form, but not in content.
0.86 	 You don't have the total story, but only fragments.
0.94 	 So, no clue about the nature of the relation.
0.71 	 Now this is what I'd call a good horror.
1.0 	 "Kind Solomon's Mines"...the very short part of the movie inside the "mines" was about as exciting as watching paint dry and I doubt that even a pre-school kid would've been spell-bound by watching the fight of the "warriors".
0.93 	 Give me Indiana Jones any day!
0.65 	 I want be watching it again at all.
0.89 	 The film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair.
0.99 	 It must be the most corniest TV show on the air.
0.97 	 His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother.
0.8 	 Please let them go of the air.
0.77 	 I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running.
0.97 	 We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face.
0.89 	 Loved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointment part two 'The Satan Pit' is.
0.97 	 One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car.<br /><br />Soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes.
0.99 	 I would like to say that curiosity got the best of me.
0.98 	 For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house.
0.85 	 The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists?
0.77 	 Please, there's more reality in The Matrix.
0.94 	 But, Hollywood intends for us to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps.
0.96 	 Otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride.
0.92 	 Home Alone 3 also raises a question.
1.0 	 Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I'd been led to believe.
0.87 	 Some things do happen though.
0.58 	 Paul has become a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter".
0.96 	 She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness, and self doubt just like the rest of us.
0.92 	 In fact apply that to every character in the film, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech.
0.89 	 An epic over the top speech as though from an inhuman robot.
1.0 	 Every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot.
0.69 	 As played in the film, there's no WAY she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds.<br /><br />IN conclusion, this film robs Clara Barton of her struggles.
0.88 	 (yes they had those back then) But hey, nice Technicolor!
0.7 	 (who cares)
0.97 	 The plot if funny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie.
0.79 	 It's really funny and I don't see how anyone could NOT like this film.
0.87 	 I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie.
0.92 	 I rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot.
0.77 	 PLease if your a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie.
0.57 	 It WILL please you.<br /><br />10/10
0.74 	 <br /><br />I really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot ...
0.98 	 Within the realm of Science Fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a pre-cinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success.
1.0 	 The first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the H.G.
1.0 	 Wells classic, `The Time Machine.'
0.91 	 The second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with it's seemingly endless and myriad possibilities.
0.98 	 And this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another H.G.
0.89 	 Wells classic, `The Invisible Man,' the realization of which, here, is `Hollow Man,' directed by Paul Verhoeven, and starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.<br /><br />Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the U.S. Government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method.
0.72 	 They have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured; their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original `visual' state of being.
0.78 	 And he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they've been given approval by the board to do so.
1.0 	 Now there's a very real chance that he may lose everything-- Including himself.<br /><br />Verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film; he establishes a good pace and uses the F/X at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development.
0.83 	 Anyone familiar with `The Invisible Man,' or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that Caine is not destined for happier times.
0.98 	 Still, Verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience.
1.0 	 Rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to Caine's suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it's inevitable conclusion, Verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film.
0.9 	 And it's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves Verhoeven's purposes perfectly.
0.99 	 There's little depth to Bacon's portrayal, but it has more to do with his director's agenda than his own acting abilities.
0.57 	 The film would have been better served, however, had Verhoeven and Bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between Caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an F/X laden extravaganza.<br /><br />Elisabeth Shue comports herself well in the role of Linda McKay, Caine's willing accomplice in the ill-fated experiment, but it's basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of Shue's caliber.
1.0 	 The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so magnificent in the 2001 film, `Things Behind the Sun').
0.96 	 Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and F/X.
1.0 	 Both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and William Devane (Dr. Kramer).
0.64 	 Entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain (low) level, `Hollow Man' is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been.
1.0 	 Like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile it'll begin to blend in with all the others you've seen, without anything special to set it apart.
0.73 	 It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience.
0.99 	 I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters.
0.59 	 Just music over black.
0.51 	 ?
0.9 	 There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called "fun"!
0.99 	 Where's the fun in it?
0.73 	 Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much.
0.88 	 Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes?
0.95 	 I think it's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows!
0.85 	 I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that?!
0.51 	 3/10
0.92 	 By the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and I was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />Steven is Steven (with an ever changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always).
1.0 	 He also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior.
1.0 	 Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one's truly special.
0.56 	 It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist.
0.97 	 Brilliant, Jean-Luc!
0.88 	 As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you?
1.0 	 Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris!
0.93 	 Incidentally, Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil.
0.96 	 It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
0.67 	 Look for it.
0.76 	 This is one of those films that I could only sit through once.
0.82 	 Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine.
0.74 	 Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming).
1.0 	 Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing.
1.0 	 It's such a great book.
0.99 	 Firstly, this is a very dated film, non-focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution.
0.99 	 Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree.
0.99 	 The chord sequence, which is not especially original, was used to much better effect in Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou'(Led Zeppelin II).
1.0 	 For a truly profound historical exposition of left-wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
0.94 	 <br /><br />The live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids.<br /><br />I don't know what the Disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level.
1.0 	 Nothing, simply nothing gets close to the simplicity and directness of the original.
0.63 	 If there is a form of art that doesn't need embellishments, it's Cohen's art.
0.99 	 It's Cohen doing a tribute to them by letting them sing his material, really, not the other way around: they may have been friends, or his daughter's, he could have become very tender-hearted and in the mood for a gift.
1.0 	 It is cool to see character actors Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q.
0.98 	 I do love certain Elvis movies, though.
0.99 	 For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'.
0.78 	 I can even stand to watch his movie with future TV co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner,'Change Of Habit' in which Elvis plays an inner-city doctor.<br /><br />Oh well, at least Elvis made a FEW good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones.<br /><br />I'll always love ELVIS!
1.0 	 Thank you, Thank you very much!
0.79 	 I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children.
0.99 	 It's curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen.
0.72 	 As for Dick Powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and his career salvation would be coming in his next film.<br /><br />I think the only reason that Dick Powell did the film was because a young player from MGM was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time.
0.64 	 His private time with June Allyson was far better than what we see on the screen.
0.9 	 The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revue and it ran in the 1940-41 season on Broadway for 160 performances.
0.55 	 When MGM bought it, they scrapped everything but the title and the title song.
1.0 	 The rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters, none of the songs is memorable.
0.73 	 Odd when you consider some of the source material is from Burton Lane, E.Y.
0.99 	 Harburg, Harold Arlen, and Rodgers&Hart.
0.76 	 Powell is the writer of a revue called Meet The People and he's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball.
1.0 	 She's interested, he's interested, they're both interested in the revue, but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale.
0.95 	 The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a commodore's suit like Lou Costello had in the dream sequence in In The Navy.
1.0 	 The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage number from The Wizard Of Oz.
0.99 	 And as just about everyone in the world has seen that film, you have an idea of Heave Ho is like.<br /><br />Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals.
0.59 	 I became a fan of Dick Francis.
0.72 	 Interestingly, electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after World War II.
0.94 	 I believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risquÃ©.
0.68 	 And such reminded me that Ms.
0.98 	 Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances.
0.9 	 It sort of happens, and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side.
0.57 	 But since the film isn't really interesting, you'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time, the movie will keep ending, and you'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again, dammit ...<br /><br />*SOME* 1980's Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing: Umberto Lenzi's GHOSTHOUSE, CHOPPING MALL & it's Killbots, the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over-the-top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind.
0.8 	 Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren't stuck with the damn thing: Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days, what with the world coming to an end & all ...
1.0 	 It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!!
0.95 	 Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!!
0.95 	 When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!!
0.84 	 See this movie if you have not seen it already!!
0.97 	 The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied.
0.97 	 I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other "INTELLIGENT" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses.
0.71 	 As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters).
0.5 	 As for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me.
0.6 	 Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better.
0.76 	 Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)
0.98 	 <br /><br />As I viewed the artwork to,"King of the Ants" I instantly thought HORROR!
0.96 	 The arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution.
0.97 	 Instead what I discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock.<br /><br />"King of the Ants" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder.
0.79 	 Except Sean Crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did I feel any compassion or sympathy for this character.
1.0 	 Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp.
0.95 	 in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober Norm from Cheers but MEAN!<br /><br />Now there are a couple of interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world.
0.91 	 It is shot on VIDEO!
0.95 	 I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's, when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in......video.
0.97 	 Some of the actors give it their best shot.
0.84 	 I can't say that it is pleasant to watch.<br /><br />Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles.
0.94 	 Her little girl voice works against her here.
0.99 	 Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points.
0.97 	 Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?<br /><br />Finally, Rosanna Arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch.
0.66 	 This is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of Hollywood dreck.<br /><br />Kurt Russell, as Snake Pliskin in a business suit, convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman.
0.53 	 However, I'll rate what I saw and hope that will steer people away from that version.
0.67 	 I rated it a "1".
0.95 	 What can I say, U.S. oriented tastes, maybe.
0.98 	 Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking.
0.62 	 The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product.
0.78 	 The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company.
0.81 	 No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet.
0.95 	 I saw this film in the worst possible circumstance.
0.77 	 I didn't know what I was watching, I thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who's child had been kidnapped.
0.89 	 The premise started taking twist and turns I didn't see coming and by the end credits I was scrambling through the the in-flight guide to figure out what I had just watched.
0.94 	 That might be a bit harsh for me saying that, but sadly so far in his directing career its true.
1.0 	 Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg.
0.91 	 Lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance carries the whole movie.
0.87 	 I do hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the bigger league of actors, she clearly has the skills.
0.95 	 The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but soon after opens them.
0.98 	 On the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type.
0.91 	 You talking' to Me?
0.83 	 When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image!
0.94 	 He goes from good fella to a surf's up dude over night.
0.76 	 His friend can't believe the change (but he scores with Faith Ford and get's a cool paying gig).
0.8 	 Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump.<br /><br />xx
1.0 	 Because the subtitles ruin the hole thing.
0.93 	 But they should at least try!!!!
0.82 	 Yes it is ironic!
0.98 	 :-) If you have got a chance to see this one, don't blew up OK!
0.98 	 No Madonna did not come up with the idea of Voguing but this is where she got it from!
0.93 	 Incredible.
0.97 	 Amazing.
0.92 	 In spite of the acting and the dialog, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise.
0.96 	 In this movie they obviously target the US Â a democracy.
0.83 	 Why don't they target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe etc.
0.65 	 It's obvious: writers of garbage like this actually admire these kinds of regimes, whether they are aware of it or not.
0.95 	 Now when she meets any celebrity in a party, she knows the actual looks of each, hidden under the illusive face.<br /><br />The movie has a message and it is crude.
0.9 	 Like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition, the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom.
0.72 	 The set selections could have been better.
0.76 	 The songs don't stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background.
0.85 	 There were a few flaws visible.
1.0 	 There could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach.
0.98 	 The meeting between Thapar and his daughter doesn't call for acting.
0.91 	 He doesn't even know that he fulfilled Bible prophecy!
0.94 	 If you don't know God and refuse to know him now, that's okay.
0.97 	 God sends no one to hell, not even you!
0.73 	 You have a right to say what you said but you don't have a right to curse with your words.
0.58 	 God have mercy on you.
0.99 	 The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however, it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment.
0.95 	 Actually, Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself.
0.88 	 Eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself.
0.56 	 He's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization.
0.99 	 I sat through this movie this evening, forcing myself to stick with it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two leads, GÃ©rard Philippe and MichÃ¨le Morgan, were major film stars of their era and I wanted to see them in "something different," which this certainly was.
0.91 	 What MichÃ¨le Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained.<br /><br />This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre.
0.52 	 I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role.
1.0 	 And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though I feared the worst.<br /><br />When Gabe (Stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger.
0.96 	 For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns.
0.92 	 Soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm.
0.95 	 At least, that's what the rangers believe.
0.97 	 In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed.
0.6 	 This film is self indulgent rubbish.
0.99 	 Watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack.
1.0 	 I was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter.
0.58 	 It is rarely that I cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.<br /><br />Although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War.
0.62 	 There isn't even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it.
0.96 	 I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler.
0.98 	 The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears.
0.99 	 There was Adam Sandler, playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around New York City on a motor scooter, looking pitiful and lost.
0.69 	 Typical Sandler-type loser character again, I thought.
0.58 	 I almost gave up then and there.
0.95 	 But then, as I stuck with this, I actually discovered something I never knew before: Adam Sandler can act!
0.75 	 This is not a Sandler comedy.
0.99 	 If your looking for that go to some of his other, sillier, stuff.
0.98 	 The only reason for the character seemed (based on one flashback) to be that she looked eerily like Charlie's late wife, but that was never really developed, and I just didn't care that much for the character.
0.55 	 A whole new slant to the end of the film.<br /><br />On another matter, this film could have been called "Scent of a Woman".
0.67 	 do not ever watch this film...it is the biggest pile of sh*te i have ever come across in my whole life.
0.76 	 hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen....although if u really wanna watch it you gotta watch the "scary shark scene"...possibly the best piece of acting i have seen in my life...ha ha.
0.51 	 !
0.92 	 <br /><br />Even if curiosity is motivating you, stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead.
1.0 	 It will be much more enjoyable.
0.99 	 It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all.
0.98 	 It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets.
0.88 	 Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please, DON'T...
0.97 	 You won't be disappointed.
0.7 	 They rang louder when a title card referred to America's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners).
0.86 	 (Missouri: It's a candy mint!
0.88 	 It's a breath mint!)
0.53 	 )<br /><br />This film has a weird flashback structure.
1.0 	 There's some very impressive stunt riding (and some fine work by stunt horses), and one excellent montage.
0.94 	 I've seen a photo of Jesse James's real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more.<br /><br />There's plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles.
0.88 	 Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting for $14.
0.77 	 )<br /><br />One continuity error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished.<br /><br />The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates.
0.99 	 Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday.
0.6 	 The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang (7 September, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James's birthday.
0.91 	 (Maybe he meant next year's birthday.)
1.0 	 Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881 ... so this scene should *BE* on Christmas Eve!
0.96 	 If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gang's getaway ... but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons.<br /><br />There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role.
0.98 	 Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters.
0.94 	 John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding.
0.77 	 In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping-up.<br /><br />Jesse James was no Robin Hood.
0.62 	 (I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that's another story.)
0.96 	 There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family.
0.56 	 In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever.
0.97 	 In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank.
0.99 	 I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol-durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes.<br /><br />'The True (not much!)
0.91 	 Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts.
0.96 	 They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady Â an aging actress or something who always dresses in black Â starts taking them out in various engrossing ways.
0.97 	 The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film.
0.73 	 EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!!
0.82 	 How do they do it, you might ask?
1.0 	 Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever!
0.98 	 Surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.<br /><br />Anyway pick it up, it is a fun movie to watch.
0.64 	 And I'm serious!
0.56 	 Brilliant actors.
0.56 	 3.
0.69 	 Louis Sachar!
0.78 	 The guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that I couldn't put it down.
0.97 	 He makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better.
0.99 	 And speaking of the script!
0.99 	 There's not a song in this film that I haven't fallen for, and that's something considering I'm supposed to be a punk-rocker.
0.85 	 If you haven't seen it, do it.
0.97 	 Johnny Nitro didn't even check on his partner, they just carried on like nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots.
0.81 	 This movie is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead.
0.86 	 Tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus.
0.76 	 This adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves.
0.72 	 See it.
0.79 	 And even better, the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out, a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie.
0.88 	 Up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have.
0.75 	 Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues.
0.98 	 And for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital (I don't want to tell any particulars), you're dead wrong on that too - I've been there.
0.76 	 The idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the US is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large, obviously fake tomatoes.
1.0 	 Enough people must also have enjoyed it as the Tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films, and a cartoon series!!
0.73 	 :Â
1.0 	 to be honest, i didn't watch all of the original 'howling', but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie.
0.98 	 i got this movie on VHS from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new.
0.77 	 actually, this movie was actually like some sort of mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys...except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (whom played Dracula himself) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie (stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT, and the ruler of werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA).
0.51 	 3/10
0.67 	 Yeah.
0.97 	 Sadly, little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty Oakland zombie!
0.59 	 I think it's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive-by, but then again, I'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life.
1.0 	 (How poor a judge?
0.74 	 In response to a gory scene involving four men, I opined "Ah-ha!
0.99 	 Jordan replied, "No, that's gang dress.
0.51 	 Oh.
0.89 	 <br /><br />Zombie explanation: When man plays God, zombies arise!
0.92 	 <br /><br />Contribution to the zombie canon: This is the first zombie movie I've seen with a drive-by shooting.
0.78 	 As far as the actual zombies go, infection is spread with a bite as usual, but quite unusually head shots don't work-- it's heart shots that kill.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Gratuitous zombie movie in-joke: A mercenary named Romero.
0.82 	 That's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy 'spaghetti' Western, but rather than detract from the picture, it adds a special flavor to the proceedings.<br /><br />Another occurs when Sanchez turns in his three dead bodies, they have to be examined for their identities - "You just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town".
0.76 	 Following the duel with Pedro the first time, Johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear Pedro's entire face with.
1.0 	 Carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory Lee Van Cleef character, without being a total bad guy.
0.65 	 At first the identity exchange between Carradine and Johnny didn't seem to make sense, but it all tied together by the time the film ended.
0.82 	 After shooting Carradine she beats a hasty retreat before Johnny can get his revenge.
0.89 	 Still alive, it looks like Carradine tries to shoot her and misses, but it doesn't take long for Johnny and Sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water - Carradine aimed for her canteen.
0.88 	 All I can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night I chose to rent this.<br /><br />I will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than "Dracula 3000", but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one DIDN'T have Caper Van Dien in it.
0.89 	 The other things it lacked in spades were: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialog and originality, but I suppose you can't have everything.<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD*** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire... go figure) flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find.
0.5 	 The humour is broad, unsubtle and, in the final scene where a BBC studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it, crude.
1.0 	 Contains just about every cliche about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to 'the old country', and every cliche about those rapacious, stuck up, whinging, Tory Brits.
0.98 	 The language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and as such will be unintelligible.
0.9 	 At times, I felt supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role.
0.6 	 The teasers for Tree of Palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning, then immediately start raving about the animation.
0.98 	 You do not bond with the characters at all, although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls.
0.55 	 I touched my companion and he started cracking up too, as did a young man seated behind us.
1.0 	 We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.<br /><br />On the bright side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs.
0.8 	 The animation almost guides you; when you don't care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
0.76 	 Saruman isnt Aruman.
0.61 	 Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work.
0.51 	 2/10
0.95 	 Well I'm blowed, a Woody Allen film that I walked out of after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film of which I've seen less than half, but I hope you'll understand why).
0.81 	 Drama?
0.75 	 The script has its funny moments Â I went almost entirely on the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!)
1.0 	 Â but there's little pace to let them fly off nonchalantly, as is best.
0.74 	 The only thing that should be done by numbers is potted reviewing Â 2/10.
0.72 	 I was seriously hoping for a third and final season.
0.81 	 Season 2 leaves you hanging, unless you read the books by Max Allan Collins, then you will know what happens.<br /><br />Dark Angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again.
0.93 	 If that would be the case, then there should be a movie to complete it.
0.54 	 Mary Shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever, but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect.
0.97 	 I also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter, but didn't catch the title.
0.76 	 I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but the talent of McCallum shines through this juvie role.
0.78 	 I certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street, much less a dark one.
1.0 	 A meteor crashes into Crater Lake, the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch.<br /><br />Alright, so the plot is just trash.
0.96 	 I guess you could say I was a little bit disappointed.
0.97 	 A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature.
0.81 	 The animals don't sing cute songs or even talk -- a major plus.
0.95 	 Sadly, the film has an uncalled for narration by Matt Damon; a sappy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production.
0.99 	 Not bad, but could have been much better.
1.0 	 Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him.
1.0 	 Sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character.<br /><br />Jack London who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around.
0.75 	 He wrote on what he knew, but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him.
0.76 	 But this was World War II and London was a big believer in the 'yellow peril' as it was called back in the day.<br /><br />Two thirds of the film covers his life as author, we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for The Sea Wolf.
0.89 	 We see him up in the Yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for The Call of the Wild.
1.0 	 London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since.<br /><br />The final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the Russo-Japanese War.
1.0 	 Like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people.
0.58 	 He advocated strict immigration policies for Orientals.<br /><br />The film puts the cart before the horse.
0.91 	 London is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the Russo-Japanese War what Japan's ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was.
0.86 	 Japan had her imperial ambitions, but so did everyone else including the USA at that time.
0.64 	 But our immigration policies caused by pressure from our West Coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with Japan over a couple of generations.
0.79 	 Instead they got Michael O'Shea who was making his second film after Lady of Burlesque.
0.89 	 O'Shea is fine in the part, but certainly was no box office.<br /><br />As London is covering the war, he meets up with a Captain Tanaka who is played by Leonard Strong, an actor who specialized in Orientals and played a ton of them in World War II.
1.0 	 From the vantage point in 1905 Strong outlines in the best Fu Manchu tradition Japan's imperial aims right up to taking on the USA eventually.
1.0 	 Must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd.
1.0 	 <br /><br />A lot of course is left out of London's life including a first wife.
0.76 	 Playing the second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward who only comes into the movie when it's half over.
0.91 	 I wish we'd have seen more of her.
1.0 	 Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955.<br /><br />O'Shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in Jack London.
0.99 	 Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they married for 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973.<br /><br />Maybe one day we'll get a view of Jack London that will be a lot better than this one.
1.0 	 The only previous Gordon film I had watched was the kiddie adventure THE MAGIC SWORD (1962), though I followed this soon after with EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (1977); he seems to be best remembered, however, for his sci-fi work of the 1950s.<br /><br />Anyway, I happened upon this one in a DVD rental shop: hadn't I noticed Orson Welles' unmistakable figure on the sleeve, I probably wouldn't even have bothered with it â since I know the film under its original title, NECROMANCY!
0.94 	 For what it's worth, Franklin â a genre regular, right down from her debut performance in THE INNOCENTS (1961) â isn't bad in her role (which requires some nudity and experiences several semi-eerie hallucinations during the course of the film); hubby Michael Ontkean, however, isn't up to the challenge of his John Cassavetes-like character.
1.0 	 Anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head.
0.86 	 There are tons of funny gags and jokes here, and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard (it happened to me!).
0.7 	 We had STARZ free weekend and I switched on the station to see what was on .
0.61 	 I was laughing a lot from the few scenes I saw.<br /><br />My friends wonder why I never want to go to Horror movies , If they saw this film they would know why.
1.0 	 I would get thrown out for laughing so hard.<br /><br />Just a couple of trivia notes : Reb Brown who played Ben White had played Captain American in a made for TV movie Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers inspiration for the song "Brown Sugar" Mick has great taste in women for sure.
0.98 	 The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing.
0.52 	 He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture.
0.92 	 These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman.
0.82 	 They had a great story with a good plot but it wasn't executed right.
0.75 	 But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel.
0.98 	 The theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though I had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet Earth.
0.62 	 By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals, anthropomorphising them to an extent, we are suddenly able to appreciate the "human side" of each species, and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy.<br /><br />'Earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice, or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta.
0.73 	 Though occasionally, perhaps to cater towards a younger audience, the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment, I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature, and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final, hopeless efforts at survival.
0.5 	 It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.<br /><br />Aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes.
0.68 	 Of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly.
1.0 	 I write this to refute a review from someone called 'Auscrit', that has appeared on this site.
0.8 	 For 'Auscrit' to make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is no good simply does not 'get' the film.
0.77 	 Or more particularly does not want to get it.
0.71 	 Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both.
1.0 	 Or someone from inside the industry either distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy.
0.98 	 Your average punter, I have found just does not write comments like that.
0.7 	 I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault.
0.98 	 Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS was released the push was, if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film.
0.89 	 This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under.
0.98 	 Unfortunately for me SS is a film about nothing, that could have been told in 15 minutes.
0.91 	 In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI's and IF awards, then it is a rigged game.
0.98 	 Looks like a teenager stole Daddy's Camcorder and filmed the explosion of his little sister Barbie model house.
0.61 	 But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to an extent.
0.96 	 Throw in a promise of jewels (????)
0.69 	 and an evil(??)
0.91 	 Or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship.
0.51 	 D-
0.79 	 It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to Foxx next.
0.5 	 Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie.
0.97 	 I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt.
0.85 	 I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted.
0.89 	 Namely, the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree.
0.83 	 Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments.
0.65 	 ***** out of 5
0.99 	 This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series.
0.7 	 Not much to see here.
1.0 	 But the death scenes were very crappy in this.
0.57 	 (8/10) <br /><br />2.
0.62 	 (7/10) <br /><br />3.
0.5 	 (7/10) <br /><br />5.
0.97 	 But they also added this funky bass-line on the soundtrack.
0.6 	 Why all of the sudden?
0.96 	 This movie also features the skinniest Afro-American model I've ever seen.<br /><br />At one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird, crazy old man lives.
0.64 	 All the same to me.
0.78 	 The most entertaining (and at the same time funny) scene is when Alice and Daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses.
0.95 	 But nicely shot.
0.97 	 In fact there are several other nice traveling camera-moves.
0.85 	 My advice is to stay away from it.
0.93 	 I admit, that one isn't Italian and isn't a JAWS rip-off, but it certainly is more fun.
1.0 	 And if you're interested in other movies made by director Sergio Martino, then I strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK.
0.89 	 That one's an over-the-top rip-off of every possible existing post-apocalyptic-future-of-doom-movie.
1.0 	 "Italians" and "rip-offs", two words that go together very well.
0.77 	 It's a small family story, pretty much predictable, but it's not the secret itself that matters.
0.94 	 The only thing I didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother, she was too tough and without necessity.
0.96 	 I've never seen THE SENTINEL look this good since I had to put up with crappy, grainy VHS tapes for years.
1.0 	 Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear.
0.78 	 It's also a portal to hell and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest (John Carradine) to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch-angels don't escape.
0.97 	 I had to do a double-take when I didn't quite place where I'd seen him before.<br /><br />Nice gore scenes of Alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil.
0.77 	 And there's a neat ending where disfigured, deformed people try to haunt Alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the portal.
0.52 	 I also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy.<br /><br />7 out of 10<br /><br />-
0.81 	 Not really a fan of either star, I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.
0.59 	 The three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them coming.
0.99 	 During the days she has been missing, he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other-side through E.V.P - Electronic Voice Phenomenon.
0.58 	 Oh well.
0.98 	 So I decided to give it a play, as I was in an undemanding mood.
0.98 	 The first hour I found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you, but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film.
0.99 	 All of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware, which makes it come across as very sterile and empty.<br /><br />You can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story.
0.67 	 After a while, it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood-curdling stuff from beyond the grave.
0.81 	 The E.V.P machine was the star on the show.
0.94 	 Michael Keaton is more than capable actor, but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed John Rivers.
0.94 	 He really deserves much better, though.
1.0 	 My brother is an avid DVD collector.
0.84 	 To no surprise at all, I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week later.
0.99 	 Granted, I can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great, and that the plot is trite.
0.99 	 He's deemed immature by the other girls.
1.0 	 Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time whenever she gets wasted.
0.7 	 For me, I was my own person, and I tend to stay that way!
0.91 	 This time, it's being brought to you by the never-inevitable Fred Olen Ray!
0.9 	 This would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high, but that still wouldn't make this one great.
0.93 	 It illustrates why top-notch 1st-person "femme fatale" action movies don't translate well in America.
0.99 	 This is another one of those movies that could have been great.
0.55 	 Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the Unibomber, and that was because a family member figured it out.<br /><br />By contrast, the kid (and to a lesser extent, the mom) behave as though they're untouchable.
0.99 	 I loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time I put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before, I think of that scene.
0.99 	 I honestly don't remember it very well - I think the character himself was so despicable I found it tedious.
0.78 	 This is never suspected at the beginning.
1.0 	 The less you know about Henry Fool the more mystery is spun around him, the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-smoking complaint machine, hurling insults at his Islamic terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him.
0.92 	 I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit.
1.0 	 Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night.
0.75 	 )'s ancestor.
1.0 	 I think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words "Clueless and appalling nonsense."
0.93 	 Is it so impossible?
0.98 	 There are far more implausible events described in other movies.
0.58 	 The acting is good, the script is funny.
0.97 	 No laugh tracks, no painful jokes, just a program.
0.72 	 Super clever title and interesting premise, but I don't think it delivered.
1.0 	 The main character's desire to reconnect with his Native roots?
0.92 	 Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death.
0.87 	 They were all just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character.
0.57 	 Finally, why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday?
0.96 	 Those are my criticisms, but I did love the shots of Seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.
0.98 	 A common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales
Peter Duffel's film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that.
0.86 	 High expectations are allowed for this film, since it was entirely written by Robert Bloch!
0.91 	 Not without reason, since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo.
0.67 	 The fourth and final story, in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears, is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility, but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that.
0.85 	 There's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star Christopher Lee in the Dracula series!
0.74 	 I truly believe that, with a bit of mood-settling preparations, this could actually be one of the few movies that'll terrify you and leave a big impression.
0.98 	 One extra little remark, though: this film may not
repeat MAY NOT under any circumstances be confused with `The Dorm that Dripped Blood'.
1.0 	 This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film, except for the title it stole.
1.0 	 I, like many horror fans, have been force fed the same banal big budget Hollywood remakes and MTV high school slasher tripe for the last 20 years.
0.93 	 I can hardly believe I watched this again last night after more than 25 years...<br /><br />Some time back, I watched 6 Fu films in a row... Boris Karloff, and all 5 Chris Lees.
0.58 	 A really WELL-MADE piece of S***.
0.51 	 AAAUGH!!!!!
1.0 	 And then they start singing "Happy birthday to Fu"... and it goes downhill.
1.0 	 Having Burt Kwouk (of whom his master says, "Your face-- is familiar.")
0.82 	 FUNNY... it AIN'T.
1.0 	 Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage.
0.95 	 It took great self-control not to fast-forward over whole sections of it, especially any scenes containing Sid Caesar (FBI chief who was also Al Capone's cousin-- you see what I mean?).
0.66 	 Like when they "audition" police officers to impersonate the King and Queen, and we wind up seeing people "audition" dance-hall routines like singing, dancing, and riding a unicycle.
0.99 	 The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that, original.
0.51 	 4/10
0.93 	 Well, if you stick with it, you'll find yourself paying attention to little else but Ms. Dey's butt, wiggling in a flowered bikini as the "Partridge Family" house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes.
0.97 	 Susan's derriÃ¨re is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo-disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene.
0.8 	 Sadly, Susie and her tush fight a losing battle: the jiggle-TV craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off, so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role.
0.89 	 As is, our Susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber, neurotic women.<br /><br />The view beyond Susan's heinie, it must be said, is not very compelling.
1.0 	 The scenery is nice, and photographed in a bizarre, hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera.
0.97 	 The only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage-son character of Steve, played by the long-forgotten (if ever-remembered) Kristoffer Tabori, who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is (supposedly) menacing his family.
0.51 	 For the sleep-deprived and Susan Deyniacs (there must be some of you out there) only.
0.63 	 I must warn you, there are some spoilers in it.
0.52 	 But to start it off, I got "Spanish Judges" on February I think.
0.98 	 It was mention it was the last copy, but as I see, it wasn't back-ordered.
0.8 	 But either way, I have it.
0.51 	 I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget, getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending.
0.88 	 If you don't know what Spanish Judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read, I won't even say what they are.
0.98 	 I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was.
0.84 	 He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars, as she said.
0.59 	 So they (mainly Jack) call her "Mars Girl".
0.64 	 There were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well.
0.68 	 The fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent, but what can you do?
0.67 	 movies.
0.83 	 And then it is also not.
0.95 	 It doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the Palestinian checkpoints.
0.99 	 Actually, it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it.
0.88 	 Yelli and Noam naturally don't object to participating in these.
0.88 	 Lulu and her political friends make t-shirts with the rave's logo, put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood.
0.78 	 The closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so Palestinian-friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets.
0.99 	 In other words, predictable products of the Âbubble".<br /><br />The opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to Nablus where we also find Noam doing his reserve duty.
0.69 	 Having grown up in Jerusalem with Hebrew, he doesn't have an Arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity.
0.87 	 But it cannot last.
1.0 	 It takes some time to really get into his "mojo", but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius.
0.99 	 Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film.
0.99 	 I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out.
1.0 	 Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lee's favorite film.
0.76 	 This film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty.
1.0 	 Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films.
0.69 	 It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own.
0.96 	 His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films.
0.99 	 It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance.
1.0 	 Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown.
0.64 	 I guess that is what I was hoping Mo' Better Blues would turn out to be.
0.98 	 This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel.
1.0 	 He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent.<br /><br />Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike's sister playing one of the love interests.
0.9 	 It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike.
0.93 	 He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse.
0.98 	 What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film?
0.81 	 That did not build for a strong remaining of the story.
1.0 	 Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions.<br /><br />There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end.
1.0 	 The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing.
0.82 	 The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film.
0.98 	 By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life.
0.92 	 Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in, said their lines, and picked up their paychecks without much conviction.<br /><br />Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa.
0.53 	 The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air.
0.79 	 Naturally, the detectives believe the new evidence will help them put together all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues.<br /><br />In flashbacks we are taken to the baptism of James Bruno's baby.
0.87 	 Eileen Bruno doesn't appear to be happy being there.
0.75 	 She caught Sean, who was drinking with Jimmy in the backyard, kiss her husband, and more shocking yet, Jimmy responding willingly.<br /><br />Somehow at the station the partners become the center of gossip.
0.94 	 Sean realizes this man is in with the drug strong man because he always makes an excuse to free the scum bags Sean and Jimmy haul into the station all the time.
0.75 	 The pressure is too much on Jimmy.
0.73 	 Cooper's own father doesn't want anything to do with a queer son.
0.83 	 Sometimes the people involved with the show, fearing reprisals from sponsors, or the networks, don't dare to present these real situations.
0.86 	 His take is right on target with a touch of sentimentality that doesn't get out of hand.
1.0 	 Now don't get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" films, and the sleazier/gorier/nastier the better - but it's still nice to see SOME sort of talent from SOMEONE involved in the film.<br /><br />SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Russo - a drug-addicted freak-show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy, Rubberneck.
0.99 	 hilarious screaming-fits from our main man, Harry.
0.54 	 In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of homo-erotic undertone to this film, with all the ass talk and constant shots of Harry running around with his dong hangin' out.
0.62 	 In all honesty, that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some T-and-A (and some full-frontal, for good measure).
0.99 	 To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this trash...A generous 3.5/10
0.8 	 Disney has now made straight-to-video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features.
1.0 	 Two of these were made for their 1991 classic, "Beauty and the Beast".
0.99 	 However, this second one, "Belle's Magical World", is definitely inferior.<br /><br />The film features three short stories, all of which take place while Belle is in the castle, and the place is under the spell of the enchantress.
0.75 	 The first is "The Perfect Word", where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast leads to trouble, and neither wants to be the first to apologize.
0.71 	 The next story is "Fifi's Folly", where Fifi and Lumiere's fifth anniversary is coming up, and Lumiere is unprepared, so Belle helps him.
1.0 	 However, Fifi sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle, and thinks they're actually in love.
0.77 	 The film ends with "The Broken Wing".
0.72 	 In this story, Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing, but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the Beast finds out, as he hates birds!
0.82 	 Apparently, in the DVD version, there is another story added called "Mrs. Potts's Party", but I've only seen the original version.
0.96 	 However, since I highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest, I see no point in watching the special edition.
1.0 	 Anyway, the first thing I will say about "Belle's Magical World" is that the animation is very 2-dimensional compared to what we're used to from Disney, which would obviously disappoint many people.
0.88 	 I didn't like "Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas" that much, but you certainly can't say the same about its animation.
1.0 	 I'm sure the stories in "Belle's Magical World" could entertain many kids (mostly younger ones, I think), and each story has a moral, so they could also teach them some valuable lessons.
0.52 	 I personally didn't find any good humour in it, found that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast got tiring, and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way (they're not very well written).
0.75 	 Even when this movie was first released, I think I was a bit past the age group it was aimed at.
1.0 	 For little kids, I'm sure "Belle's Magical World" can be highly entertaining, and probably somewhat educational with its morals, but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans.
0.86 	 Stereotypical was created for films like this.
0.84 	 If you want to watch this film, I suggest you aren't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were.
0.56 	 The gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous.
0.98 	 It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a "missing poster" from when she was eight.
0.95 	 Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie.
0.77 	 What are we ?
0.93 	 What do they think, they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them.
0.97 	 Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen all shooting at him..... and he shooting back at them.
0.74 	 CRAP.<br /><br />I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement.<br /><br />I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
0.63 	 Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective.
0.96 	 You should watch "Yugoslavia:Death of a Nation", Made by Discovery channel and BBC.
0.78 	 It's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment!
0.97 	 Great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag.
0.84 	 It appeared to be some kind of computer generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision.
0.99 	 I highly recommend taking your $3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and spending it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere.
0.9 	 After reading some quite negative views for this movie, I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it.
1.0 	 The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell.
0.99 	 The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable.
0.99 	 Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis.
0.52 	 The story doesn't take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India) but I can't find out where it is supposed to be happening.
0.57 	 First of all, I ain't American or Middle-Eastern.
0.95 	 The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies.
0.99 	 Examples:<br /><br />1) Ken Loach's segment.
0.97 	 He justified the murders due to - America being a democracy and because some Americans voted the politicians in power, then all Americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the Middle-East.
0.62 	 Is this guy for real??
0.96 	 Some Americans don't even know where the Middle-East is; some don't even know what religion is practiced there; and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes.
0.96 	 ### Mr Chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic.
0.99 	 The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world.
0.52 	 And yet, we are not allowed to go about our lives because "some" people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion.
0.91 	 We are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.<br /><br />3) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims.
0.78 	 Another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda.
0.94 	 Some people always think about the "me, me, me."
0.97 	 They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty.
0.5 	 Blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />This movie denigrates the memory of "Sept. 11th, 2001" victims.<br /><br />The best thing for it is the TRASH CAN.
1.0 	 At the time there was a lot of "Overpaid, over sexed and over here" type of comments.
0.54 	 It's got everything.
0.6 	 These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).
1.0 	 It's also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin.
1.0 	 Note its cornball usage of slow motion filming.
0.93 	 Its sex is less showy, yet more erotic.
0.99 	 Its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period.
1.0 	 Its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era.
1.0 	 Doesn't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its "gotcha" moments.
1.0 	 Even if you've seen everything, there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop.<br /><br />What Could Have Been Better About It: The acting was, at times, flat and unconvincing.
0.98 	 It had a "shot-on-video" quality in some places (though,it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for), and the camera work is full of needless close-ups of meaningless actions.
0.76 	 The ending seemed rushed, and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments.
0.98 	 Michael York's work was a fair match for the role, since he was the center of the film, and did a good job.
0.99 	 and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here.
0.99 	 and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies.
0.99 	 the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category.
0.96 	 Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again.
0.98 	 As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine.
0.93 	 This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins).
0.59 	 Skip it.
0.78 	 Leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or from above ala Busby Berkeley.
0.76 	 What I do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience.<br /><br />As others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie personas.
0.74 	 This is where this movie could have been a lot better.
0.94 	 The acting in this was so good I had to pinch myself and say "Remember, it`s only a movie, this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPEN".
0.74 	 As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk, I knew that it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting.
0.51 	 It isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like, but this time I think I've found it.
0.99 	 As they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere.
0.84 	 The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them.
0.96 	 Than it all goes wrong.
0.6 	 The two friends literally have to run for their lives.<br /><br />Apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time.
1.0 	 Especially because this isn't actually a bad movie.
0.96 	 I happened across "Bait" on cable one night just as it started and thought, "Eh, why not?"
1.0 	 It suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness.
0.7 	 But overall, this movie worked.
1.0 	 All the elements aligned just right, and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film.
0.98 	 I don't know who tagged Foxx for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor.
0.93 	 Again, they could've slipped by without any of this, but it just makes things that much better.<br /><br />I'm surprised at the low rating for this.
0.95 	 Maybe I just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7/10.
1.0 	 Women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film Piedras.
0.97 	 The women controls the plot line, and the men are bound to be left with each other, eventually...
0.57 	 It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score.
0.94 	 I can watch this film anytime.I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score.
1.0 	 I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!!
1.0 	 Another great movie by Costa-Gavras.
1.0 	 It's a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics.
0.7 	 Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased.
0.53 	 For example he presents the US actions as brutal and inhumane, while representing Tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive.<br /><br />As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved.
0.94 	 This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe.
0.95 	 There may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like I was.
0.7 	 Bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times.
0.98 	 However, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development.
0.5 	 All the actors acquit themselves well including Miranda Richardson in what could of been a throw-away role.<br /><br />Though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing.
0.5 	 i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were Ice Cube and co. get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking Neo-Nazis and win!!!
0.62 	 the neo-Nazi where twice the size :), and the chase!
1.0 	 the chase is priceless...
0.91 	 Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane's past, which John vehemently denies.
1.0 	 There's a clever premise here, and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy.
0.82 	 This is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures.
0.87 	 Those really lower this one a bit.
0.99 	 Had the twist been changed, it would've scored higher, the rest is acceptable.<br /><br />The Cloak-Veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson, (Jon Pertwee) upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film, goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store.
0.82 	 The cloak soon turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with co-star Carla, (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampiric acts at home.
0.71 	 This has a pretty decent premise, and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares, but what sinks it is several factors.
0.73 	 First, it's just too goofy for it's own good.
1.0 	 There's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through.
0.6 	 I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started.
0.58 	 Understandably, he is soon asked to leave.
0.83 	 Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass?<br /><br />At any rate, I was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction.
0.98 	 We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine.
0.94 	 I didn't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that?
0.93 	 Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut.
0.98 	 But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that
1.0 	 As a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated, so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the "Progressive Party."
0.92 	 An interesting idea for a film, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together.
0.95 	 When he was younger, Einon got stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart.
0.97 	 Now grown up Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king.
0.98 	 Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for "killing" dragons.
0.99 	 Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur.
0.99 	 It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.
0.74 	 Worth watching!
0.9 	 Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska.
0.56 	 He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it.
1.0 	 The other voices are bad.
1.0 	 Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola.
1.0 	 Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous.
1.0 	 It's so bad it nearly ruins the film!
0.81 	 I'll probably end up buying it myself.
0.79 	 Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama.
0.96 	 At first, three words: READ THE BOOK!
0.98 	 Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters.
0.61 	 The novel - in the first place!
0.92 	 - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure!
0.95 	 That's only the surroundings.
0.9 	 In the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat!
0.51 	 ...
0.64 	 I'll never watch it again!
0.99 	 Obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production.
0.59 	 But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot.
0.6 	 I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything...
0.51 	 or "so how did that aspect of the character come about?"
1.0 	 I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.<br /><br />If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot, but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra.
0.81 	 Eric Norris, son of Chuck is the director .
0.56 	 Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.<br /><br />It's a really good story.
0.9 	 It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense, in plot but especially in character motivations.
0.89 	 This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense.
0.9 	 We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen.
0.56 	 We know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car.
0.53 	 And that is what happens.
0.99 	 That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap.
0.72 	 And don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story.
0.89 	 A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river.
0.89 	 We also know when he is going to be wounded.
0.61 	 They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days.
0.82 	 It's true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq.
0.77 	 But what is the meaning of such a film?
0.96 	 This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem.
0.99 	 Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance?
0.9 	 In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, thinking now about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous.
0.86 	 I can't believe this film is SO difficult to find -- I'd buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet.
0.92 	 On his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother.<br /><br />In some ways Comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie-making, perhaps the 60's or 70's.
0.78 	 Certainly it reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968), and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which deal with loss, grief and relationships between parents and 'lost' children (curiously both films star Mia Farrow).<br /><br />All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways.
0.94 	 All three films have a chilly feel, both emotionally and literally.
0.98 	 All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and ultimately all three films pose the question - 'what is real, what is imagined?'
0.99 	 Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected.
0.86 	 If you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie.
0.68 	 An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat.
0.56 	 He wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind?
0.88 	 Is he just getting old?
0.98 	 There is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words, the whole movie speaks for itself.
0.99 	 Those were pretty but the only thing I didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear.
0.86 	 He could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that, it was a pretty deep movie.
0.99 	 Yep, lots of shouting, screaming, cheering, arguing, celebrating, fist clinching, high fiving & fighting.
0.7 	 A naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points, but then you'd probably spot the many flaws.
0.57 	 I remember seeing this when it was released, in a theater in Palo Alto, and not expecting much.
0.77 	 Richard Chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in Sidney, facing an Australian aborigine elder named Charlie.<br /><br />Chamberlain: "You were outside my house last night.
0.8 	 And Charlie at a deliberate pace replies, "Who are you?
0.87 	 Are you a fish?
0.89 	 Are you a snake?
0.52 	 It's a stunning scene, shot all in close ups, with Chamberlain's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to Charlie's black, broad-nosed, bearded visage.<br /><br />The two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable, almost unspeakable, mysteries of Charlie's world.<br /><br />I don't think I'll go on much about the plot.
0.98 	 Charly's world simply begins to intrude into Chamberlain's dreams, for reasons never made entirely clear.<br /><br />If there's a problem with the script, that's it.
0.98 	 Nothing is ever made entirely clear.
0.87 	 Do the aborigines?
0.52 	 The mysticism of Charlie is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments," but they're brothers under the skin.<br /><br />But I don't care about that.
0.82 	 I like Weir's stuff, which resembles Nicholas Roeg's in being pregnant with subliminal dread.
0.96 	 After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.<br /><br />You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house.
0.51 	 Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans.
0.57 	 I saw most of the episodes of RMFTM as a teenager on "Cliffhanger Theater" running after midnight on a local station some years ago, and then again when Mystery Science Theatre riffed on it in the early 90's.
0.98 	 <br /><br />I can certainly make allowances for the special effects, which were quite impressive for a low budget 50's serial (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes were better than George Reeves/Superman's in his TV show).
0.9 	 except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men.
0.99 	 Since everyone does this, the viewer finds it immersive after awhile, and even to my modern sensibilities, it doesn't bother much.
0.96 	 Cody also flies his ship to the Moon (the woman assistant comes along to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back.
0.59 	 This was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like it's another episode of "Gangbusters".
1.0 	 I appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints...and I appreciate that Cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre (even though he loses half of his fistfights).
0.95 	 LOCK THE DOOOOR!!"
0.79 	 <br /><br />Still, it's OK. Of the three Republic serials I've watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better plot, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!)
0.73 	 and a better hero than "Radar Men", but it's an OK time-waster.
0.63 	 Shouldn't the title have been "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon?"
1.0 	 It is a word not used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale.
0.72 	 I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts.
0.89 	 It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute.
0.62 	 He can't send her back and he can never touch her.
0.98 	 I'm a nice guy, and I like to think of myself as genre-tolerant.
0.92 	 And, I guess by that, I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in.
0.98 	 The acting rose into "good for a high school play" territory from time to time.
0.95 	 Imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there... that's what happens with this film.<br /><br />The opening showed promise, but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear: to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re-hash of 'mis-understood, brooding bad-boy' (Andrei) meets 'innocent, whimsical beauty' (Paula).
0.92 	 Andrei's admission of being (eponymously) a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a Byronic hero should have - but even when we're told in heavy, underlined writing who and what he is, it's still difficult to believe it - or care.<br /><br />For a Byronic hero/antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are utterly absent here.
1.0 	 This is not his best work.
0.91 	 The glimmers of interest were brought by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as 'Vashon', and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer/brother.
0.68 	 It's the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers(a shape-shifting feline-like, flesh eating, life needing, near extinct breed of humanoid) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive.
0.94 	 They come across as pretty normal upper-class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home, day and night.
0.75 	 Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it's typical Stephen King downbeat ending.
0.99 	 The movie is interesting because King's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection, but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn't cut it.
0.7 	 The ending is fitting though, tying it back into the first one in an indirect way.
0.5 	 I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of.
0.85 	 Severed was not.<br /><br />It was worse.<br /><br />(spoilers - who cares?
0.92 	 He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two or three years.
0.71 	 One head a week.
0.97 	 And the police are JUST NOW calling in a "specialist" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again).<br /><br />Schya right!
0.98 	 Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides?
1.0 	 And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a "Loki"-like trickster god.
0.97 	 )<br /><br />If you made it this far through my comments, I congratulate you.
0.78 	 Instead of the usual elf toy makers, this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from "It's a Small World"!
0.93 	 I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys.<br /><br />Then, the scene abruptly changes to Hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a Busby Berkeley musical.
0.99 	 The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cute--like Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees!
0.56 	 <br /><br />Somehow a poverty-stricken Mexican kid named Lupita, a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa!!
0.72 	 In fact, as they root her on, you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesus--as he has all these great powers AND fights the Devil over kids' souls!
1.0 	 Later, Santa meets with his friend, Merlin.
1.0 	 He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams.
1.0 	 He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors.
1.0 	 Considering he keeps kids as his personal 'assistants', this magic key thing worries me immensely!
0.94 	 He gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems--two problems solved.
1.0 	 This is a rare case where alcohol/drugs HELP kids and solves problems!
0.92 	 Will St. Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win?
0.9 	 If you care, tune in and see.
1.0 	 It's a film you should NEVER show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish!
0.66 	 Now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ?
0.96 	 Does he speak like that in real life ?
0.73 	 If he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies
0.72 	 Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it.
1.0 	 This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video.
1.0 	 My collection boasts over 1,600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed.
0.55 	 I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film.
1.0 	 Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar, It's In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally.
0.98 	 So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS.
0.73 	 Plenty!
0.99 	 The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue.
0.81 	 I paid the original price of $29.95, and I never felt more cheated in my life.
0.95 	 If ever a film deserved it, this is it.
0.97 	 Would someone please put this out on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS anymore.
0.55 	 The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced.
0.97 	 Little Dorothy is whisked back to Oz, which has gone to ruin, and meets old and new friends.
0.56 	 The inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less-inspired shows from Hanna-Barbera, however many of the songs are good, particularly Dorothy's sweet lament "It's a Far Away Land", superbly performed by Liza Minnelli.
0.53 	 You can count on Minnelli for energy, which is why the movie perks up whenever Dorothy is around.
0.93 	 Though it has its confusing parts of the plot, it doesn't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie.
0.98 	 That being said, If you're not open to more liberal political ideas, then this probably isn't the movie for you.
0.99 	 I thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area, but that's intentionally done.
0.79 	 If they had cut most of the attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
0.99 	 I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with.
1.0 	 Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers.
0.98 	 Anyway I wish best of luck for the future.
1.0 	 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds.
0.98 	 All my mates at school watched.
0.86 	 We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school.
0.77 	 We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott.
0.96 	 Counting down from 5 became an art form.
1.0 	 I took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what I loved as a child.
0.96 	 The only high point was the snappy theme tune.
0.71 	 Not that it could compare with the original score of the Thunderbirds.
0.98 	 Thankfully early Saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series Gerry Anderson and his wife created.
0.85 	 Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition.
0.93 	 These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there.
1.0 	 Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities.<br /><br />There are many fine supporting actors.
0.99 	 Ann Nelson plays the grandma here.
0.85 	 Three years after this, she would star in "Airplane!"
0.92 	 as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty.
0.81 	 I could not get that image out of my head.<br /><br />Matt Boston is a fifteen year old with problems.
0.94 	 His grandfather had a massive heart attack.
0.98 	 First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson.
0.79 	 Nelson tells a tale in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film.<br /><br />She and Grandpa bought an RV, cheap, and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert California.
0.94 	 The RV soon has a mind of its own, going off the road and such.
0.83 	 The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes, and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks.
0.95 	 Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own tale.
0.92 	 One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield, and Matt begins acting all crazy.<br /><br />The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert.
0.73 	 The scenes where Grandpa is trapped on the RV roof as it careens down a dirt road takes forever.
0.92 	 Mom's conversations with the mummy take forever.
0.98 	 Matt's out of body experiences take forever.
0.84 	 Did they inhabit the RV?
0.71 	 The film maker never brings up the fact that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways, they never kill anybody!<br /><br />As I kept thinking of Nelson in "Airplane!," I also thought of other movies.
0.93 	 This is not scary, and like the ghosts, you too can still walk...away from this tape at the video store.<br /><br />This is unrated, and contains some physical violence and mild profanity.
0.97 	 Unfortunately he can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her.
0.96 	 Then, one day, she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods.
0.66 	 !<br /><br />This horrified people in 1933 but it's pretty tame by today's standards.
0.98 	 Lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude, it's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such.
0.98 	 There's only a few minor shots of her breasts.
0.75 	 Also when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm.
0.94 	 Except for the music score this could be a silent picture.
0.93 	 The scenes with the sexual symbolism (there's quite a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today.
1.0 	 I found the movie slow-moving (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and had a negative ending.
1.0 	 I can live with the ending but it doesn't excuse the other problems I had with it.
0.94 	 Also the final sequence is REALLY strange--and out of place.
0.69 	 It was well-done and I'd recommend it but with caution.
0.64 	 Amen to Magsel.
0.8 	 First off, how do you know which movie you are purchasing?
0.94 	 Henry Cele stars in every one of them.
0.98 	 AND WHAT'S WITH THE LOVE STORY???
0.6 	 I watched it dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago.
0.81 	 I was unsure whether or not Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "Malibu Express."
0.99 	 The main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as KSXY.
0.57 	 Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters.
0.99 	 In "Fit to Kill" they confront their long-time nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most prized diamonds.
1.0 	 A well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic.
0.98 	 Panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come.
0.97 	 It is now suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized.
1.0 	 The costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking.
0.97 	 My personal rating is 10/10.
1.0 	 The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero.
0.96 	 Andy, keep up the good work.
0.96 	 For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls, think again.
0.94 	 it is not uncommon for people to look like they've just had an orgasm after eating bread.
0.83 	 That weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows I've watched in a while.
0.83 	 So she goes to a little town of Fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth: Morality comity.
0.83 	 See, Elvira actually is a real witch, she just doesn't know it.
0.97 	 Over all direction is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that.
0.61 	 If you like this kind of thing, that is.
0.55 	 Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of Zola.
0.99 	 Muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it.
0.67 	 He was a giant in the business for at least a decade.
0.96 	 He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before.
0.99 	 My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age."
1.0 	 Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated.
0.97 	 In that regard, this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big-time since the 1960s.<br /><br />However, it must be noted the facts support this story.
0.89 	 Good for him!
0.63 	 These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that they'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land.
0.73 	 So many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation.
0.94 	 Falling into a star... improbable.
0.96 	 It's also not the Parent of the Year awardees.
1.0 	 This foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat, which makes up most of the film's action.
1.0 	 You have to love those hard sci-fi statistics!
0.64 	 Nor do I know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans.
1.0 	 The violence is not over-the-top or needless.
0.55 	 It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair.<br /><br />There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting "reality" TV to senseless violence.
0.94 	 He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight.
0.99 	 Rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the "Night Watchman."
0.62 	 Lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job.
0.64 	 But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric "I got the evidence on you!".
0.53 	 Talk about seeing into the future...Too funny for words.
0.82 	 My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies.
0.99 	 Somebody could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-TV phenomenon.
0.94 	 What happens to their lives after they appear on this show?
1.0 	 Greed greed and more greed.<br /><br />Compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into.
1.0 	 How on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me.
0.96 	 (unless its the directors family)
0.95 	 i'm not even sure what to say about this film.
0.82 	 to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa "like dancing about architecture".
0.99 	 this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie Adaptation wanted to write.
0.99 	 I saw "Rachel's Attic," thinking that I would be in for an enjoyably visceral, ride.
1.0 	 Visceral, yes, but enjoyable?
0.86 	 Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change...I hear they're hiring at Mel's Diner!
0.97 	 There are very few, well made, Inde movies coming out of Michigan...and "Rachel's Attic" isn't one of them.
0.99 	 it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me!
0.91 	 this isn't 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise' but it is a fine road movie.
0.56 	 these are areas where the Muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other.
0.83 	 I'm sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly, nowadays, it's not the case, even for film buffs.
0.87 	 Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and Â on top of that Â it likes to exaggerate tremendously.
0.99 	 and it kills for fun!
1.0 	 The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location.
1.0 	 Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous.
0.96 	 Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark.
0.92 	 So bad it becomes fun again.
0.81 	 Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends.
0.53 	 A B-movie on cinemax is better.
0.54 	 Here we see a brutal blasting of Catholics and/or the Catholic clergy (and I am not Catholic).<br /><br />This won actually won an Academy Award for bes foreign film.
0.58 	 One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else.
0.85 	 The daughters take turns seducing the "seminary" student (who states he studied for six years but says he's an agnostic!).
0.82 	 One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.<br /><br />I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more.
0.77 	 Sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes.
0.85 	 Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
0.97 	 It's 1982...ET is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time...Atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system.
1.0 	 Some people say Steve Irwin's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act.
0.82 	 Watch this film: it's obvious he can't act.<br /><br />Steve Irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his *Crocodile Hunter Diaries*, *Croc Files* and eponymous *Crocodile Hunter* series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?
0.67 	 - Ed note.
0.68 	 If you find his persona trying, the film is a failure, but if you're a fan of either him (as a businessman, conservationist or just plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget.<br /><br />John Stainton, faithful liege, best mate and helmer of the Crocodile Hunter *oeuvre* (can it be called that with a straight face?
0.98 	 ), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made Steve a household wildlife jester.<br /><br />The most jarring aspect of this movie is that Steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks) and Terri (Steve's spouse of 10 years, fiercest ally and closest friend) treat it like it IS one of their documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and speaking directly to the camera, whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie (well
).
0.99 	 <br /><br />Of course, watching this madman's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings.
0.51 	 But to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *Crocodile Hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows.
0.99 	 The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him.
1.0 	 And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints
 <br /><br />So enjoy this diversion for what it is Â a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend.
1.0 	 He died doing what he loved Â interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that.<br /><br />(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
0.97 	 I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work, so I had high hopes for this movie.
0.56 	 There are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences.
0.86 	 The movie makes frequent use of the Denis Leary character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character.
1.0 	 It is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started.
0.73 	 Edit cuts galore, etc...
0.85 	 Add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot, which is a film no-no.<br /><br />This documentary hits a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories, that the movie is just so easily done.
0.93 	 He could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the Passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie.
0.98 	 More could have gone into the history of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had quite the colorful past.
1.0 	 One is a very methodical, very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories.
0.66 	 It builds on itself from a solid bottom up, a new layer on top of a more proved layer.
0.78 	 An enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way.
0.73 	 It is so, because well
 I said so.<br /><br />Done right
 I'd say turn it into an HBO original series
 hit a different religion every week.<br /><br />It was an eye opener about one thing.
0.99 	 And well... now that is the blind leading the blind.<br /><br />Bill Moyer.. Well.. what can I expect from a guy who hands out at Sutra in Newport beach?
0.96 	 The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas.
0.63 	 She's also getting over a divorce.
0.8 	 They go into a corner room and they do it.
1.0 	 Thankfully, Kira gets a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff.
0.57 	 Remember kids, safe sex).
0.96 	 When she does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that.
0.99 	 First off, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm.
1.0 	 I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great.
1.0 	 The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it!
0.74 	 To sum up, I don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
0.65 	 So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh?
0.69 	 Well, think again.
0.72 	 Don't miss it!
0.83 	 In the LDS Church, congregations are called "wards" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall".
0.97 	 It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe.
0.6 	 You can do better than this!
0.9 	 This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie.
0.93 	 The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: <br /><br />"It's a world of suffering,<br /><br />In a sea of pain,<br /><br />No matter how much sun you bring,<br /><br />You're pummeled by the rain...<br /><br />Don't let the heartless get you down,<br /><br />Don't greet the heartless at your door,<br /><br />Don't live among the heartless"
0.69 	 ).<br /><br />YOu will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones.
0.9 	 Only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have happened.<br /><br />But on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent.
0.72 	 A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).<br /><br />8.
0.68 	 <br /><br />9.
0.99 	 Strange and funny fact i suppose.. and no I am not a child actress.
0.55 	 It is a film I've only seen in truncated parts, but Art should be taken as a whole.
0.86 	 That audience and myself were effected by this film!
0.94 	 One woman who lived through WW II was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive, albeit corny, ending.<br /><br />The things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits.
0.68 	 It is not the film title, but the creator's title, and then before any other humans, such as actors or production, are listed, the director William Cameron Menzies is up there!
0.55 	 Who?
0.71 	 This film was made in 1936, and it's obvious it meant something to the other auteurs.
0.59 	 "These toys children have nowadays are nothing like I had when I was child," "It'll help develop their coordination," "What do we need books for, what do we need to read for?
0.98 	 ", "We don't need cars, there's nowhere to go, we have all we need right here," "There will be no war."
0.54 	 But war there is!
0.99 	 The naive citizens of "Everytown" refuse to see the literal writing on the wall.
0.91 	 This is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to Hitler's appeasement.
0.99 	 This war does not end.
0.86 	 The poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.<br /><br />It is another dark age.
0.78 	 Plague, warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists.
0.98 	 The world has rebuilt itself with the help of that "puny animal, man."
0.92 	 Helicopters fly in this film, before they were even invented.
0.64 	 "Beware the concussion, you have been warned!
0.92 	 So be warned, this film might hit you like it hit me.
0.89 	 Others criticize Mr. Wells vision.
0.83 	 It is very easy to work with 20/20 hindsight regarding things, costumes and foley miscues.
0.76 	 This is not cheap cardboard British Science Fiction, but worthwhile Epic Filmed Opera, sans singing, that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings.
1.0 	 There was nothing this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side.
0.78 	 No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion.
0.93 	 Actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else.
0.94 	 The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui.
0.71 	 He brings with him a mental patient (I'm not making this up) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him (not one lick of this BTW is explained), a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal.
0.92 	 By the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off-scren you're really feeling cheated.
0.97 	 I'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie, I would probably never talk to them again.
0.92 	 Anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry, hermit type personality.
0.9 	 I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's okay; I don't think this covers any range of humor though.
0.9 	 Go in and get ready to walk out; it's best to get your money back too.
0.74 	 Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging.
1.0 	 A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10.
0.99 	 I'm not going to cry...thank you.
0.62 	 Before Cujo,there was Lucky the devil dog.
0.74 	 Does the dog have something to do with it?
0.71 	 This is one of the many 70's made-for-TV horror movies that was actually scary for a made-for-TV horror movie.
0.71 	 The plot line was not very believable, but the script was well written.
0.74 	 It does not directly apply to a action-packed sports movie.
0.87 	 I give this a movie a 7/10.
0.91 	 Have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre?
0.55 	 Ever heard people laugh and thought "what the dickens are you on"?
0.74 	 Got to go, there's a clown at my door.............
0.77 	 OK here is how I do this.
0.57 	 sparingly.
0.64 	 All in all less is more, and this had it ALL!
0.93 	 Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again.<br /><br />Character development - I give this component 9 points.
0.79 	 This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.<br /><br />Dialogue - I give this component 10 points.
0.95 	 I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie.
0.99 	 I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.<br /><br />Ending - I give this component 9 points.
0.65 	 I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.<br /><br />Total: 93% Buy the DVD?
0.76 	 HEL YES!
0.55 	 See it in the Theatre?
0.98 	 Then, she lands the plane perfectly.
0.98 	 We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we're talking about a regular, frightened, yet very well composed flight attendant.
0.81 	 Ironically, unlike "Snow White", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story.
0.84 	 "Cinderella" did not follow the same path.
0.62 	 Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen.
0.66 	 And indeed he had.
0.98 	 It simply has never looked better.
0.92 	 This documentary was not about the culture of Puertoricans.
0.87 	 It was about the culture of Nuyoricans.
0.99 	 Puertoricans and Nuyoricans are two different cultures.
0.75 	 Rosie, before you make a documentary, you need to do the research.
0.9 	 You also need to check and make sure your sources are credible.
0.86 	 Puerto Ricans are not all loud and they do have class, which is one thing the documentary lacked to show.
1.0 	 When I saw Rosie and Jimmie on the View and Rosie on Martha Stewart I was very excited about watching.
0.96 	 I even made sure to let my parents know since they love Puerto Rico so much.
0.89 	 You need to go and visit Puerto Rico and you will see that Puerto Rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50% of the population is in poverty.
0.94 	 ), casinos, churches, agriculture, Auto Expresso, and restaurants just to name a few.
0.81 	 Poverty?
0.93 	 Puerto Rican culture is about family, music, food, celebrating, and trying to move forward not backward.
0.95 	 Parents of Puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about Puerto Rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what Puerto Rico is all about.
1.0 	 They will see its beauty, people and culture.
0.51 	 Please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity.
0.99 	 Oh, and please don't tell your American friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the Puertorican people look ignorant.<br /><br />Yes, I am born and raised PUERTO RICAN from the island.
0.67 	 Why do I bring this up?
0.93 	 This makes the movie all the better because it's much more painfully realistic.<br /><br />But what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the "other side of the story."
0.91 	 It's not like they want to kill people for attention.
0.94 	 I guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a great "How Not To Make a Movie" guide.
0.88 	 The reason for that photo?
0.97 	 His only shirt was in the laundry.
0.73 	 He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.<br /><br />Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened.
0.71 	 What killed him?
0.99 	 The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis.
0.94 	 As a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd.
0.72 	 They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers, in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead.
0.73 	 When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.<br /><br />Just as Russell's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers.
0.96 	 What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers.
0.69 	 The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one.
0.82 	 The writer also didn't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women "sir".
0.89 	 Another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the never-ending crop of crud emanating from Hollywood!
0.94 	 POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; GETTING POPEYE'S GOAT **1/2<br /><br />I used to lap these up as a kid but, catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back-to-back now i.e.
0.84 	 several years later (they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they don't hold up all that well!
0.89 	 One interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with Popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience.
0.87 	 Dialogues are sparing, with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts, doubts, or feelings.
0.64 	 Here, the skies are covered and gray, the air is cold and misty, and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled, dirty snow of the village streets.
0.74 	 In the "waiting room" facing the Albanian border, the refugees, political or other, outcast by the rest of humanity, wait.
0.54 	 Of course, the "politician" is not Alexander's father, but the "politician" stands before Alexander like a father figure/Odysseus.
0.87 	 He states as much, in a voice-over at the beginning of the film, paraphrasing few lines from Dante's "Inferno": "And don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again.
0.97 	 Angelopoulos does not give us any clues, and the wife's statement, "It's not him," is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough.
0.97 	 The important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician, but that he could be the politician.
0.58 	 Whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river, and thus communications across the border are still not possible, and it remains impenetrable, we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river: the camera has crossed the border, and the reverse tracking shot is inviting Alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary.
0.64 	 I was about seven/eight years old when it was on.
0.58 	 It scared the h*ll out of me!
0.98 	 I can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly.
0.94 	 And the ending, oh my God!
0.88 	 My question to any readers: Has anyone purchased this set?
0.61 	 Its a bootleg.
0.78 	 I have a sketchy and poor DVD of "The New House" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids.
0.63 	 This is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island, then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them!
0.97 	 Lots of bad GCI, goofy plot elements, and babes sweating in tight T-shirts follow.<br /><br />These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (I guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexy babes.
0.97 	 But let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight T-shirts, sweating profusely.
0.93 	 One's in her undies at the beginning, another at the end.
0.98 	 The plot is full of goofy stuff, a guy drives up in a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter.
0.99 	 The sharkman is hilarious - either awful CGI or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit.
0.89 	 Without Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster.
0.91 	 The end is fairly corny, though.
0.91 	 I wont give it away, but it could be improved.
0.97 	 I'm a huge fan of the Cusacks, this being the sole reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the reprise, in complete and depth less quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc.
0.94 	 Imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the (watch if your a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves.
0.96 	 Sound familiar?
0.63 	 Then it changes.
0.51 	 Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister?
0.94 	 Although, it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble-head for a change.
0.66 	 During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game.
0.56 	 Yes, you heard me right.
0.85 	 Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a definitely one-sided marriage, spent on a huge estate in Chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!).
0.51 	 I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was ultimately disappointed.
0.99 	 Still worth watching for the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films.
0.94 	 And what kind of name is Lonnie Earl?
0.98 	 If you want a good Billy Bob Thornton movie, go see Slingblade.<br /><br />My mom found this movie for $5.95 at Wal Mart...figures...I think I'll wrap it up and give it to my Grandma for Christmas.
0.94 	 people's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh.
0.95 	 Antitrust falls right into that category of films that aspire to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat.
0.94 	 I don't hate the film, but it is missing key elements, such as suspense.
0.89 	 ), thereby destroying any real shock value.
0.79 	 And of course, the news coverage of the arrest of Gary Winston is more fevered than when Hinckley or Oswald was brought into custody.
1.0 	 But that fits perfectly here in Antitrust, which should be called 'Anticlimactic' or 'Anti-Original'.<br /><br />In the years to come, this film will likely be banished, to be shown only on your local third rate UHF channel.
0.64 	 "Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes"...the list goes on and on.
1.0 	 Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title - "Seinfeld".
0.78 	 What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of "humor", and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled.
0.97 	 Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, "the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized", on the "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory."
1.0 	 In other words, it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers.
1.0 	 The true meaning of friendship?
0.92 	 I want to be a friend?
0.92 	 I want to live in Manhattan?
0.72 	 Wake Up.
0.65 	 apartments?
0.94 	 Get real.
1.0 	 All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of that.
0.69 	 Now, shut-up and pass the Soma.
0.93 	 I have never found out why.
0.97 	 Too often it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.
0.53 	 Yes, the problem of the most German films are in this film "Gespenster" too.
0.88 	 Thats not clear for the other girl Nina in this film.
0.54 	 But Nina lost everything.
0.83 	 Why?
0.8 	 This films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside.
0.97 	 Thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination.
0.98 	 Throw it all away - and go nowhere!
0.68 	 But the film stand always in some distance to seem.
0.61 	 There is no much explaining of them.<br /><br />In the center of this film, there is one scene you will never forget.
0.85 	 The two girls got to a casting.
0.52 	 And there they should say how they find together.
0.72 	 In this scene Toni will lying on.
0.84 	 There is no exhibition in it.
0.92 	 She looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here.
0.87 	 <br /><br />Einstein is wracked by guilt over Hiroshima yet fancies the simplicity of a sexual liaison with Munro; Munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and craves intellectual credence; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting powers but is an impotent sleazebag; DiMaggio is insecure about his celebrity, self-obsessed, and prone to violence.
0.77 	 affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us.
0.93 	 Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron-bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience.
0.89 	 Indeed, ALL the references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable viewer: one au fait with '50s occurrences/personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century.<br /><br />This film and its screenplay are either very, very clever, or extremely opaque and pretentious.
0.89 	 No, this movie is not deep -- who cares?
0.98 	 I've always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to Katharine Hepburn.
0.76 	 This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, fÃ©minin and I urge you to see that film instead.<br /><br />The film has two strong elements and those are, (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo.
0.93 	 Without going too far on this subject, I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place.
0.51 	 2/10.
0.98 	 Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails.
0.74 	 It's a tale of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal.
0.83 	 It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together, despite not being strong enough.
0.99 	 If you pick up a little of what it's about from the off-set, you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this.<br /><br />It's true what everyone said about the performances, and the lead stars, Winstone and Burke, do deliver some great acting.
0.9 	 Likewise, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase, the full impact of the night before kicking in.<br /><br />This is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow, as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next.
0.99 	 It's been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!)
0.93 	 I know they're going for realism, but to be frank I just don't want realism.
0.95 	 If I want to see daily life, I'll uhm, live.
0.99 	 Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk.
0.62 	 We get to see Rosetta walking to someplace, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying around bags of far, Rosetta walking back home, Rosetta walking someplace...it's just not that entertaining.
0.58 	 I guess I'm supposed to love this, but come on, there's nothing in there.
0.91 	 Whenever he would do this character on the show I would crack up laughing.
0.9 	 A film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title, "Farewell My Lovely", thinking the gullible would assume it a remake.
0.99 	 The Danes character finally let's Buddy have the awful truth.
0.68 	 Great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except, maybe, seeing this film.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Wait a minute.
0.97 	 This irony is intended!
0.94 	 But somehow I doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind, sadly.
0.71 	 Maybe there are a few mistakes, after all.
1.0 	 Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life.
0.98 	 SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact.
0.51 	 :(
0.98 	 I occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes.
0.99 	 I try to enjoy it for it's basic idea which is helping a needy family, but several factors get in the way for me.
0.54 	 Every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted (which they are) and tears flow seemingly on cue.
0.95 	 The attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me.
0.6 	 Probably the biggest problem I have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family.
0.97 	 Instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights?
0.98 	 Why do I need help finding things to feel sad about, why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative?
0.99 	 I know what is being done for these families is good, but they are also being used for ratings.
0.69 	 I guess when I see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the U.S. could not afford for their children it really bothers me.
0.98 	 I know so we can be entertained and have a good cry.
0.54 	 Don't get me started on game shows.
1.0 	 So I realize that Extreme Makeover Home Edition is "doing good", but forgive me if I see it as more self serving than giving of itself.
0.99 	 A documentarist, like any filmmaker, must convey a compelling story.
0.73 	 "<br /><br />Lame.<br /><br />Compare this with documentaries like "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War" which create a narrative drawing material from interviews, stock footage, and filmed footage.
1.0 	 In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.<br /><br />The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma, and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes.<br /><br />One of the more interesting passages was Chomsky's recounting of his experience with National Public Radio.
0.5 	 Yet another media outlet to be skeptical of.<br /><br />This documentary is for Noam Chomsky completists only.
0.93 	 It was just a grim, sad waste of time.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is excellent actor.
1.0 	 Peter Stormare is an excellent actor.
1.0 	 I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep.
0.9 	 At one level a slow walk through the heartland, it's kind inhabitants, and amber grain, at another level about growing old and remembering what is important(and actively forgetting what isn't).
0.77 	 On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc.
0.97 	 Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom/com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston, who mug and call it acting.
1.0 	 It's too bad.
1.0 	 As other IMDb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting.
1.0 	 It reminds me very much of the old "Topper" movies, which were also so enjoyable.<br /><br />This movie exposes popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like "Ghost" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are.
1.0 	 We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre.
0.51 	 But even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence.
0.95 	 The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend.
0.99 	 Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to.
1.0 	 They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king.
0.91 	 At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king.
0.85 	 So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s.
0.99 	 I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers!
0.59 	 Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better.
0.99 	 For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp.
0.99 	 I knew that "who's on first" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.<br /><br />Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo.
0.8 	 While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey.
0.98 	 Where was all the humor?
0.51 	 !
0.8 	 I can watch Monty Python all day, but, as much as I like this show, I can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time.
0.92 	 ), so the end result is somewhat tiring.
0.76 	 If only the director Sogo Ishii would have been wise enough not to overuse his bag of tricks.<br /><br />Other problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence.
1.0 	 For a film with such an anti-violent message Gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time to depict the endless battle scenes.
0.95 	 The audience can't be sure of this, either, until the very end of the film.
0.87 	 The powerful (albeit cynical) ending is what saves Gojoe; it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore-fest.
0.75 	 And it has influenced filmmakers in their work Â "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for instance, would look a lot different if "Without You I'm Nothing" didn't exist.
0.56 	 Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind.
0.98 	 There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters.
0.94 	 You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes.
0.97 	 If you're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory, read "The Elegant Universe" by Brian Greene of Columbia University, and "The Universe in a Nutshell" by Stephen Hawking of Cambridge.<br /><br />Recipe for #$*!
1.0 	 New York, I Love You, or rather should-be-titled Manhattan, I Love Looking At Your People In Sometimes Love, is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation.
0.88 	 bits involving Bradley Cooper, Drea DeMatteo, Hayden Christensen, Andy Garcia, James Caan, Natalie Portman, etc).
0.99 	 It's not even so much that the film- set practically always in *Manhattan* and not the New York of Queens or Staten Island or the Bronx (not even, say, Harlem or Washington Heights)- lacks a good deal of diversity, since there is some.
0.9 	 Everything else can be missed, even Natalie Portman's directorial debut, and the return of a Hughes brother (only one, Allan) to the screen.
0.97 	 I saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were...what?
1.0 	 However, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help.
1.0 	 What I'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible.
0.76 	 In fact it's a new vernacular.
0.98 	 The prospect of Michael Caine pulling off a Patty Duke-like Keller-to-Sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing.
1.0 	 Hunt it down, watch it, and just enjoy a story-and-a-half.
0.84 	 is more frightening than this one.
0.79 	 After "A Dirty Shame", I never thought that I was going to see another John Waters movie.
1.0 	 That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all his movies would be like that.
0.7 	 The first reason is that this movie has an actual story.
0.64 	 This movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible.
0.86 	 Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it.
0.87 	 I give this movie a 6.5/10.
0.99 	 I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don't particularly hold my interest, but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children.
0.52 	 Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children's activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children's movies.
0.78 	 The "acting" reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices.
0.98 	 Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is.
0.99 	 Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given: <br /><br />If you are lost, don't worry, you will inevitably find your way home.<br /><br />Approach wild animals without any fear.<br /><br />You can win any competition just because you "know" you can.<br /><br />and my favorite, the final message left in the film: <br /><br />It's okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right.
0.99 	 Movie: There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie.
0.85 	 Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it, it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick.
0.96 	 Here is a little mind game for the readers.
0.96 	 Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies.
0.54 	 Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon.
1.0 	 His best performance was I think in "Beyond Borders".
0.98 	 His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in "Sin City".
0.61 	 Surely this guy knows acting, what he doesn't know is better way of choosing roles.
1.0 	 Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie, if you are watching her for the first time in your life.
0.79 	 It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie.
1.0 	 The movie is about bank robbers, why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there, nice try playing with people's emotions, worked on anyone?
0.84 	 Riiiiiiight, please, we're talking about US police force and security here.
0.75 	 Many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.<br /><br />Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets.
0.6 	 Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him.
0.99 	 Why I won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen.
0.87 	 The dialog is written in clichÃ©s; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this.
0.98 	 And she's the best part of this film.
0.97 	 What a way to launch a career.
0.97 	 Think of this pilot as "Hawaii Five-O Lite".
0.96 	 Oh, there are some minor differences - Roy Thinnes is supposed to be some front-line undercover agent, and the supporting cast is much smaller (and less interesting), but basically the atmosphere is still the same.
0.93 	 Problem is, "Hawaii Five-O" (another QM product) already existed at the time and had run for years.
0.75 	 It filled the market demand for Hawaii-based crime dramas quite adequately.
0.59 	 Thinnes is an old pro, and he gives the role his best shot, and he isn't bad.
0.58 	 But Thinnes is only as good as his material and his director.
0.81 	 Ian McShane is in here as an evil spy master named "Tree", and McShane tends to be the most interesting actor in any scene he appears in.
0.91 	 But he's phoning his part in here.
1.0 	 At least for for a series aimed at white audiences brought up with Marsha Brady and Peggy Lee as our love goddesses.
1.0 	 Zulu is, well, his usual self - enjoyable in bit parts, but he isn't a person who can carry a feature by himself.
1.0 	 <br /><br />MST3000 revived this for their treatment in their sixth season, and they had a lot of good natured fun with it.
0.96 	 I was lured to see this movie by its starpower, but ultimately that's all it delivers.
1.0 	 It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption.
0.98 	 "Q&A", which also takes place in New York, is a far better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".
0.99 	 My Super Ex Girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, I was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what?
0.73 	 It was!
0.99 	 And not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing MST3K make fun of it.
0.99 	 The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring.
0.98 	 Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure.
0.73 	 It was even more scary.
0.98 	 She agrees on condition that they don't swap any information about each other - not even names.
0.82 	 This is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a stand-out part of the film as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the scene.
0.95 	 Alan Curtis started well as the confused, innocent man, but once he is arrested his performance took a left turn as he became thoroughly unpleasant to Kansas for no reason.
1.0 	 God knows why she stuck by him.<br /><br />The film doesn't keep you guessing as to who the murderer is as we know from about halfway through the film, but this doesn't matter.
0.98 	 Molly Ringwald, well what else needs to be said.
0.51 	 Wheeeew!
0.9 	 "<br /><br />1-- Rainbows are not black, and can never be.
0.52 	 "A black rainbow of death" is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation.<br /><br />This is what you're in for.
0.72 	 this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad... hence, can i advice anyone to watch it?
1.0 	 <br /><br />My vote is one.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Para Sempre Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
0.89 	 Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story.
0.99 	 What a brilliant idea for a satire--the genre is rife.
0.98 	 a few extremely hilarious, inspired bits.
0.99 	 Paul Rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (the nerdier ones).
1.0 	 The clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the very few songs used are also perfect.
0.98 	 First I liked that movie.
0.95 	 It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments.
0.99 	 The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best!!!
1.0 	 The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste!!!
0.97 	 The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead of it, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together.
0.64 	 The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it alright.
0.98 	 Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : )))...
0.95 	 For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!
1.0 	 ), she was true to him, she loved nobody but him, and when she met him and was just about making love to him, after a scene with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years!!!
0.56 	 I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend, but after i did go see it, it was simply amazing; the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money.
0.97 	 The two photos were graphic and very disturbing.
1.0 	 They have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low....and it shows.
0.96 	 This used to be THE premiere show to watch...and it's just garbage now.<br /><br />I will watch Access Hollywood from now on.
0.63 	 It has been said that Deanna Durbin invented teenagery.
0.99 	 One unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for Durbin vehicles became locked into the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became stale.
0.84 	 Deanna herself never did.
0.66 	 Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had.
0.88 	 It seems to me that, like many another film personality, she substituted "naturalness" for the histrionic ability that she lacked.
0.85 	 This cowardice and self-censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series, and is ultimately responsible for its failure.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century, but he is hamstrung by two things.
0.97 	 Well, here's a clue for the writers - any person familiar with Viking mythology will tell you that Valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle, two things that the Nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing.
0.59 	 It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilter's character do not feature him at all.<br /><br />Until we learn to stop sugar-coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of Germany was mostly unopposed to Hitler's views, and not necessarily through ignorance, we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy (yes, Germany was a democracy pre-Hitler) can occur anywhere, we are doomed.
0.5 	 That's the one thing this mini-series got right in portraying.
0.95 	 In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess..).
0.98 	 This is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it.
1.0 	 Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one.).
0.69 	 Let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults.
0.81 	 OK, fine.
0.96 	 Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally.
0.79 	 I like the revelation of the ghosts.
0.96 	 Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder?
0.72 	 Oh, yeah--extra points off: the only Black character seems to be the grandson of an "Our Gang" pullman porter.
0.55 	 The bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy, as was the chick in the shower.
1.0 	 Those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie.
1.0 	 Each is great on it's own, but mixed up?
0.72 	 Such potential.
0.87 	 I am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on IMDb.
0.9 	 The fanboy mentality strikes again.
0.97 	 When this movie came out just about everyone slammed it.
0.97 	 Even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable.
0.8 	 Even laughing quite a bit.
0.87 	 Alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident.
0.97 	 Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on screen.<br /><br />The only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat.
0.91 	 The scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but I couldn't look away.
0.9 	 The director went all out there so he gets points for that.
1.0 	 Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.<br /><br />All in all Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot.
0.91 	 Its never boring, its always funny and I wasn't checking my watch every minute.
0.84 	 That should count for something.
0.59 	 This movie really deserves the MST3K treatment.
0.52 	 A pseudo-ancient fantasy hack-n-slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective IQ of hot water, character names that seem to have been derived from a Mad Libs book, and such classic lines as "Hold her down and uncover her belly!
1.0 	 OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I'm well out of the room before it comes on.
0.8 	 What happened to detective programmes with real mystery???
0.8 	 I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago???
0.98 	 I had a German Shepard and it is a really good dog.
0.92 	 That is another story all together though.
0.5 	 Also, we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower.
0.61 	 That is about it.
0.65 	 The father suspects something though, as his family seems to be getting rather strange, somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed.
0.93 	 All in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards...television movies that do work are out there as "This House Possessed" is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good.
0.94 	 My points;<br /><br />Film is based on 2 things;<br /><br />1) Ethnical point of View: As it happens on most of the American Films, the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture.
0.95 	 Lebanese people are Christian (Ok they got that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries.
0.98 	 Please watch Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor.
1.0 	 A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it.
0.63 	 Where is the truth?
0.87 	 When I watched The Eye, I was kind of disappointed about this two guys, who I had heard good words about them before.
1.0 	 That film (The Eye) has a really bad script, especially the ending (childish,cliche and too coincident in my opinion) , but its still good in photography and experimental images.
0.98 	 So I decided to see One take only and I didn't disappointed again.
0.99 	 The only problem about this film is I get a bad DVD.
0.53 	 Undetected by anyone, except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about...and gets away completely free.<br /><br />Some specific points are particularly hilarious: While standing in front of the president, Cuba a deflects the assassin's bullet...which then enters the back of the president's head.<br /><br />Cuba and Angie watch film from a news camera, and they see...a clue.
0.94 	 They go to great lengths to protect the film, believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film.<br /><br />Cuba speaks with a presidential staff member.
0.75 	 Cuba can't make out a painting, and she says, "You're too close...stand back...look from a different perspective, look from my perspective."
0.96 	 Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, centers around three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence.
0.55 	 Interesting.
0.99 	 My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life.
0.84 	 This escalates into violence.
0.94 	 And the violence changes them.
0.98 	 And their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses.
0.82 	 Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence, this is a major problem.
0.75 	 Confusing.<br /><br />The more interesting pair of the characters is the "stalker couple."
0.99 	 Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two.<br /><br />I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film.
0.97 	 It is admirable.
0.68 	 I don't think Calson achieved want he was aiming for.
1.0 	 Unlike "Ray" or countless other films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is reliving the great songs themselves.
0.69 	 Yuck.<br /><br />The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with Cohen himself.
0.59 	 Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work (never singing)-- like letters, poems, etc.
0.88 	 "Addictive" is an adjective I've heard many times when talking of certain TV shows.
0.59 	 With all due respect, there can be no such thing, and for a good reason: no other silver-screen thriller is based on a real-time structure.
0.69 	 At midnight?
0.88 	 No time for napping, then: Jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case.
0.91 	 Despite being made in 1928, with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films.
0.99 	 Maximally manipulative Anabel Sims (Betsy Drake) sets out to trap her ideal man, aided by her co-worker, Julie.
0.52 	 Can a movie receive less than one star?
0.9 	 Yes, there are vampire stereotypes.
0.96 	 Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here.
0.85 	 Even martial arts stereotypes.
0.96 	 The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying so.
0.87 	 And indeed, it may not be the last.
0.74 	 More film companies are coming in to shoot.
0.96 	 It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the perspective of the monster.
0.82 	 As the movie goes on, it gets a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant.
1.0 	 The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it.
0.64 	 Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates.
0.96 	 There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it.
0.56 	 Still.
0.53 	 Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals.
0.54 	 That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie.
0.92 	 Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work, one look at that commentator from "Plan 9 from outer space" and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece.
0.91 	 Just like that, when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece "House of Dead", with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.<br /><br />So, the movie starts like this - first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die.
0.52 	 You know, to keep you wandering.
0.54 	 Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently..
0.7 	 Get it?
0.73 	 Some guys in rubber suits start running around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang, they go out of the house, meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman (who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons) and then decide to go back to the house.
0.92 	 My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story?
0.79 	 OK, I am not a professional movie critic but come on...a true story!!!
0.71 	 This film is one of the more risquÃ© black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the Hoyts Code was enforced.
0.92 	 Lily Powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money.<br /><br />I thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films I have seen because there is hardly any background music heard.
0.94 	 The director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism.<br /><br />This film was all together an alright movie.The ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been, but it didn't entirely ruin it.
0.89 	 Baby Face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next.
0.83 	 (See, for example, my glowing review of Altered States [1980].
0.74 	 I wanted to see it because of two reasons.
0.7 	 One, it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance, whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility, as in The Big Knife.<br /><br />But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake.
0.66 	 Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film.
0.97 	 I don't even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role.
0.83 	 They surely could have come up with some different ideas.
0.82 	 Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir.
0.87 	 It's definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it.
0.57 	 In some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in Louvre Musseum.
0.84 	 Every shot is like a piece of art.<br /><br />*My rate: 7.5/10<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />-------------- -<br /><br />------------<br /><br />-------------------
1.0 	 It's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old Indian traditions.
0.95 	 She has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of "otherness"; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era.<br /><br />Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than was Davis', almost through the the whole movie.
0.69 	 Davis' Mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance.
0.88 	 I WIPED MY MOUTH!!"
0.8 	 Davis' realism was monumental.<br /><br />IMDb votes concur!
0.97 	 <br /><br />The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progression.
0.71 	 Here's the film, dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks, flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows.
1.0 	 Shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he's a 500 year old Asian.
0.84 	 Continue on dear reader if you have the Balls.<br /><br />so Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks.
0.99 	 I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing.
1.0 	 Its a Korean legend and she's reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese.
0.88 	 See, in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy.
1.0 	 There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a cafÃ©' with sassy black friend.
0.58 	 See, people were afraid to come out after 9-11 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for.
0.99 	 If i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win.
0.83 	 <br /><br />After being given a satisfying dragon on Helicopter battle my cruel lover Dwar treats me to a pi$$ and vinegar filled scene to end it all with.
0.87 	 Bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under LA i guess.
0.94 	 Few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god, sets Baurki on fire, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with Dragon-god, dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits... thank god<br /><br />Now our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times.
0.99 	 I'll call him Tuskan Shredder.
0.99 	 I like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises.
0.56 	 <br /><br />The actors for the most part were great... if great somehow meant terrible.
0.87 	 That Giant snake acted his heart out.
0.98 	 There was emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast.
0.91 	 Yes damn it, my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake.
0.97 	 I've got the balls to admit that, do you?<br /><br />Here's to hoping Bauraki get's more work and isn't type cast, that Jason Behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare, and that i never have to watch Blue Monkey again.
0.72 	 <br /><br />So, D-War its over.
0.96 	 I want my CDs back and let's just be friends
0.85 	 Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book most everything is correct.
0.95 	 The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts.
0.98 	 I found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie (because I hadn't found out about the movie yet) but later I found the movie in a bargain bin at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I had expected.
0.63 	 Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior "The Last Command" from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture.
0.95 	 If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes.
0.59 	 Skip it.
0.76 	 Okay.
0.62 	 Stephen King adaptation (scripted by King himself) in which a young family, newcomers to rural Maine, find out about the pet cemetery close to their home.
0.94 	 It gets a little better toward the end, with genuinely disturbing finale.
0.82 	 In point of fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why I can't completely dismiss it - at least it has SOMETHING to make it memorable.
0.66 	 ).<br /><br />4/10
0.79 	 This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD.
0.92 	 Then, three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle.
0.99 	 Part way through this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which made my siblings and I laugh so hard.
0.99 	 Then, she and the Beast fight more over the letter... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness.
0.51 	 How old are they???
0.98 	 Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness.<br /><br />Then, the next one's all about Lumiere being the world's biggest dope when it comes to romance.
0.87 	 What a message to send the kids!<br /><br />Then, the next one's all about Mrs. Potts being angsty.
0.81 	 Plus, she's petty and very different from the usual Belle.<br /><br />And the side characters are annoying... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time.
0.98 	 Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop?
0.91 	 They really made some waves in Dutch cinema.
0.92 	 (just an example of the quality).
0.7 	 German expatriate director Wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound swamp set.
0.77 	 It might have worked if "Daggers" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle.
0.76 	 This may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor.
0.93 	 The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole.
0.84 	 Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds.
0.99 	 Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank.
0.63 	 I, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling.
0.87 	 Not a good sign.<br /><br />Visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.
0.67 	 The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian.
0.61 	 Very controversial upon its release in 1978, the "R" rated film is now "PG" in this much more liberal time.<br /><br />Recently released on DVD, the disc contains a "Making Of" segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not "real" are mistaken.
0.83 	 Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across "Quite Ugly...", I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned.<br /><br />I obviously had too much faith.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't quite fit.
0.94 	 You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card.
0.66 	 You get the same with a Hallmark movie.
0.98 	 Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought.
0.96 	 In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid.
0.72 	 We have seen it before.
0.66 	 You might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned.
0.57 	 Malcolm McDowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different.
0.5 	 Especially designed for people who like Yellow filters on their movies.
1.0 	 Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life.
0.98 	 SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it, in fact.
0.51 	 :(
0.99 	 These people need to learn how to balance a camera.
0.86 	 looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and guns.
0.95 	 Sutherland was in his '24' mode - I can see this for free.
0.75 	 I just don't see the President of the United States running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze.
0.61 	 Have since I was a kid.
0.52 	 Many more 'movies' like this and I'll quit going.
0.79 	 Seeing The Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow, and Aquaman (even though all he did was swim) made my eyes widen.
0.8 	 I wish they had made this episode a little longer, like a two hour special, because i felt that one hour of the Justice League wasn't enough.
0.98 	 But i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole.
0.99 	 But that's a minor quibble.<br /><br />Sadly, this film appears to have been bypassed by Western licensing companies.
0.73 	 Watch ELVIS's skin change color throughout the film.
0.95 	 (spoilers)<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie.
0.76 	 I've been renting on movielink for a bit, and decided to check this movie out.
0.7 	 Alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood.
0.91 	 Though I do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades.
0.78 	 The movie points out the problems some families face with gender.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned with the ending.
0.98 	 But the ending wasn't a disappointment either.<br /><br />I think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win.
0.97 	 (Maltin's movie book does not contain it.)
0.7 	 In nearly every department, Amazing Mr. Williams is a jewel.<br /><br />It's the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended.
0.85 	 I saw it twice in the mid-70's, and then it disappeared.
0.59 	 If you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
0.9 	 That's a far as it goes.
0.81 	 She's had a pretty good deal where she was, especially considering her visual disability and the unending, loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.<br /><br />The Guinness' prize for corny melodrama, however, goes to the characterization of Alan.
0.95 	 Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but "rats" on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss!
0.97 	 As a supervisor, Alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work.
0.83 	 No clichÃ©-free zones here, mate!
0.97 	 Not only this, but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter.
0.88 	 What's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg?
0.97 	 Why doesn't the hotel, where the couple makes love, eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and, among other pandemoniums, the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion.
0.99 	 Anyway, in this movie Waldemar Daninsky is bitten by a yeti-like creature in Tibet (great dialogue here -- "It was a yeti.
0.99 	 He is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals.<br /><br />First of all -- Jacinto Molina, Paul Naschy, whatever you want to call him, he's a fine actor and cared passionately about his work.
0.91 	 Some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage.
1.0 	 Some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar, and there's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where Daninsky runs from house to house through a village, slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes -- one scene is particularly intense, but it's actually lifted straight from Molina's first movie, "La Marca del Hombre-lobo" along with a few other shots.
0.7 	 Gods knows what omissions there are -- I'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future.<br /><br />This is a overall a decent piece of vintage Naschy which experienced fans might enjoy, but it could have been much better and so probably wouldn't make a great introduction.
0.6 	 Then the little girl has "visions" of mommy (who she killed), and often subsequent night terrors which always, always end by the father holding and coddling her.
0.66 	 This is why Israel "occupys" their land, because those countries lost it in a war they started.<br /><br />The film also claims that Israel has defied the U N by not complying with Resolution 242.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language, nudity, rape and violence, it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force.
0.99 	 Patrick Wright (Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler "Track of the Moonbeast") has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom.
1.0 	 Provo who's hatred of Burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death.
0.99 	 it was that hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and, after taking some half dozen bullets, thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty, as well as mindless, lunatic away for good!
0.96 	 I heard they are writing a new script so who knows...
0.89 	 I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them...
0.99 	 - i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe, but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds.
0.83 	 i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club.
0.85 	 i think 700 club folks really do love Jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did.
0.69 	 It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up.<br /><br />The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it.
0.83 	 The large movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner.<br /><br />Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the Art of film making for sales.
0.95 	 This is very scary.
0.97 	 We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about.
1.0 	 Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture.
0.96 	 Not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks.
0.75 	 I didn't find Justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list.
0.88 	 Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find any of that.
0.98 	 I don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen.
0.94 	 Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series.
0.95 	 SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret.
0.93 	 It remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day.
0.98 	 Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works.
0.85 	 Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150).
0.77 	 The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks.
0.98 	 An enjoyable piece if you have the time, but do not expect anything more.
0.75 	 That's what kept me from turning it off.
0.85 	 of every episode -- that's all in place.
0.98 	 Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be Homecoming Queen.
0.99 	 She is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to her aid to help her with her Martial Arts.
0.74 	 Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, tiger, etc.
1.0 	 and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world.<br /><br />This movie is great for kids who want to learn about Martial Arts and the Chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible.<br /><br />Brenda Song is a comedic actress and I can't see her playing a serious role.
1.0 	 It was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over Shin.
0.55 	 Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies.
0.94 	 High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on Disney Channel, along with other movies like Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, & Stuck in the Suburbs.<br /><br />If you like action-adventure and corny jokes, you'll like this movie.
0.82 	 Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although he is in practically all German movies that count.
0.95 	 But also because he is NOT the main actor.
0.93 	 That kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone!
0.94 	 This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the movie.
0.65 	 <br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera.
0.95 	 I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those token English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points.
0.94 	 There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one.
0.88 	 Although not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem "put on".
0.85 	 He may sound a little too old for his age, but Duo's English voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal Japanese one.<br /><br />Trowa, the pilot of Heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to befriend.
1.0 	 The Maganac Corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents.
0.67 	 The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would have also sounded better with some classy European accent that reflects their status of nobility.<br /><br />Despite underwhelming acting from the side characters, the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of Gundam Wing's script.
0.6 	 <br /><br />Given that this film, and Durbin herself, were much publicized at the time as "Universal's last chance," the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age, but you'd never know it from the ease and assurance Durbin displays on screen.
0.88 	 True, it's hardly "realistic," but why would anyone expect it to be?
0.85 	 Rent the original it's 100 times better.
0.66 	 <br /><br />
0.5 	 I recently watched the first Guinea Pig film, The Devil's Experiment, and I must admit to being disappointed.<br /><br />This film is invariably included in any list of the "nastiest" films and maybe I was expecting more because of the hype.
0.85 	 Even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though, I think I'd have worked out that it indeed wasn't.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what is being done to her just aren't what they should be.
0.75 	 We got to discussing why I watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film.
0.56 	 A pseudo "good movie".
0.84 	 Camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters.
1.0 	 (one exception : Ned Beattie"s nice and simple way of playing the hit man).
0.99 	 Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is awful too see.
0.61 	 If you haven't already seen it, do it today!
0.8 	 She had to turn back time and repeat a day.
0.9 	 I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy Libby she was ugly.
0.83 	 Many people hate movies like this because they don't understand what's going on - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other good films use this device.
1.0 	 Other than that, rent it if it's available but don't lose any sleep if it isn't.
0.88 	 Both of books are Great <br /><br />Read the book then watch the movie, you may like more then I did Give this 2 out 10
0.75 	 called " Necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens .<br /><br />These slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other .
0.99 	 They infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other Necroborgs .
0.97 	 Their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it .<br /><br />All in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and I didn't expect much , but at the end I actually enjoyed this film .<br /><br />As I said before , this is a low budget flick , but it's still relatively decent .
0.9 	 Don't expect much from actors , they're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated .
0.75 	 Well done!
0.5 	 The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show.
0.99 	 There wasn't a lot of slow scenes.
0.98 	 And bless 'em, the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power; to be fair, that might be the fault of the film-makers, but equally fairly, it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars.<br /><br />As for the performers........... Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed, and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause.
1.0 	 James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest "anthem" ever, "Stand and Fight", in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine.
1.0 	 (Remember, if you dare, "Dance With Me" and "Still the One".)
0.98 	 It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music.
0.8 	 Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - his protest number "We Almost Lost Detroit" is on topic at least, but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being.<br /><br />Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss, but he absolutely smokes, no question.
0.82 	 Part of me thinks he was taped separately, at another event, and edited into this movie to give wake the audience.
1.0 	 And with more exciting musicians.
0.95 	 <br /><br />So really, there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance, and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline.
0.98 	 He is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed Mama's boy, and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie.
0.92 	 Maybe it inspired Treasure Planet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's really boring in the DVD format.
0.99 	 The shows are all basically identical.
0.99 	 By today's standards, the animation is spotty.
0.94 	 They actually saved men.
0.99 	 There are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them.
0.93 	 This is what films should be about- they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong.
0.99 	 I would only recommend this movie to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like, I'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy Christmas.
0.99 	 But there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres.
0.81 	 You can also see that in the very unsteady character development.You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles rather than one.
0.97 	 Sexo Cannibal, or Devil Hunter as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts with actress & model Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner as Ursula Fellner) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant Jane (Gisela Hahn).
0.84 	 After a long days work Laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named Chris (Werner Pochath) & Thomas (Antonio Mayans) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous Jane.
0.88 	 It's as simple & straight forward as that.
0.86 	 I also must mention the hilarious scene when Al Cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff, this is achieved by Franco turning his camera on it's side & having Cliver crawl along the floor!
0.72 	 Just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along!
0.84 	 Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible, one to avoid.
0.97 	 Except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, makes it pretty long.
0.88 	 I loved "The Curse of Frankenstein" so much that I rushed out to get "Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed" to see Cushing at it again...even if it was without Chistopher Lee this time.
0.74 	 The monster is half the fun of the whole thing!!
0.82 	 This film is dedicated solely to the study of Baron Frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum.
0.89 	 I'm willing to suspend a fair amount, but this movie got fairly ridiculous, which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.<br /><br />Peter Cushing, though, is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film.
1.0 	 For being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men, he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well.
0.97 	 Instead, my suggestion is to watch "The Curse of Frankenstein" and see a truly great Hammer horror film.
0.8 	 BAD IDEA!
0.95 	 This is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends.
0.93 	 Speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer, the egocentric actress, the has-been baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the spooky quiet chick, the 'nicer-than-nice' nice girl, a freakin' black cat... and I didn't care about any of them.
0.99 	 This one makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big screen Hollywood epic.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women.
0.92 	 As an ordinary movie-watcher I can't say I enjoyed watching this one.
0.98 	 It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action.
1.0 	 And IMHO it's the most thrilling part of the movie :)
0.74 	 When the police arrives at the place, young officer Wai sees how Pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him.
0.99 	 The latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump.
0.98 	 He knows no restrictions, has no mercy and barely speaks a word.
0.93 	 Lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses; he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis.
0.97 	 People with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film, because the cruelty and shocks featuring in "Dog Bite Dog" can easily cause nausea.
0.88 	 It's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air, but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically.
0.94 	 If you fear you can't, just wait a few years for the inevitable American remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little.
0.95 	 First of all, what is good in the movie ?
0.98 	 the exotic background ?
0.97 	 Dennis Hopper is not very good here.
0.91 	 There is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough.
0.61 	 There will be lots of women crying at the end of the film.
0.84 	 These are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera, forget scripted lines, etc.
0.6 	 By researching other kids attacks on their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what not to do and they inform (usually in a silly 'This Old House' kind of way) any potential 'Andres and Calvins' who might be watching this video how to make bombs, get weapons, and not get caught before Zero Day (the day of the attack).
0.77 	 The Fallen Ones starts with archaeologist Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant, now there's something you don't see everyday.
0.87 	 Matt is working for property developer Morton (Robert Wagner) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist Angela (Kristen Miller) for reasons I'm unsure of.
0.99 	 Anyway they both try to figure out what they've got on they're hands when some of the team go missing, Morton calls in security guy Ammon (Navid Negahban) to handle the situation.
0.99 	 Meanwhile ancient text translator the Rabbi Eli Schmidtt (Tom Bosley) translates some ancient text (as he would) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the Fallen One, or something like that.
0.77 	 This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company.
1.0 	 But, the performances are heartfelt.
0.99 	 The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes.
0.91 	 Who will survive?
0.99 	 But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out "The Bagman".
0.89 	 Having previously seen the abridged print presented by David Shepard, I finally got a hold of a complete--or nearer complete version, which was about 56 minutes compared to the 30-minute version more widely distributed.
0.78 	 Several aspects of this one stand out, though.
0.58 	 And, the other replies, "Romance, nuthin!
0.77 	 Fellow female screenwriter Anita Loos made a similar self-referential conclusion to another film from 1917 'Wild and Woolly'.
0.96 	 Im glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot.
0.84 	 I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a cafÃ© to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station.
0.61 	 It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds.
0.86 	 OK where do i begin?...
0.97 	 Initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen.
0.97 	 I saw this movie two weeks ago at the "festival des nouvelles images du Japon" in Paris.
0.99 	 The stories are quite different, but the worlds pictured are very much alike.
0.93 	 And from this point of view, "a tree of palme" definitely can't stand the comparison with Miyazaki's masterworks.
0.87 	 While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle.
1.0 	 I stayed, since I was enjoying a wonderful ice-cream with nuts during the whole movie.
1.0 	 First of all I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best batman series by far.
0.65 	 We watched it when it used to be on TV.
0.79 	 He doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is).<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who does the best batman.
0.91 	 They just included this series as season 4 for marketability.
0.79 	 He's held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional.
0.97 	 There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go.
0.78 	 As far as artistic merit, there is none.
0.8 	 The scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film.
0.94 	 Sure, it had some of the makings of a good film.
0.73 	 I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk around in Prada?)
0.57 	 It soon becomes apparent that some of the other members of the Council are in league with Don-del-Oro.
0.52 	 Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one?<br /><br />What follows are several hair raising escapes by Zorro and his confederates from the followers of Don-del-Oro.
0.88 	 We have the ever present collapsing rope bridge, the deep chasm between two cliffs over which only Zorro can jump to safety, and the usual assortment of explosions, fires and coaches and wagons crashing or going over the cliff.
0.75 	 Sistas in da hood.
0.63 	 Looking for revenge and bling bling.
0.87 	 Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s.
0.71 	 If he saw Lil' Kim, he might say, "Alright!
0.65 	 And, I don't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the OK Corral.<br /><br />I watch this on BET, so I missed the action that got it an R rating, but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil' Kim in that action.
0.51 	 I was 10 years old when this show was on TV.
0.68 	 The actors were very credible.
0.96 	 They didn't have super-powers.
0.82 	 There was no fancy stuff, like in other shows.
0.99 	 They didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show.
0.83 	 If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of pain.
0.72 	 For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes.
0.75 	 The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation.
0.9 	 When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important.
0.94 	 It opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival, who pressures her into a car race.
0.68 	 The folks at American International were obviously fond of decent, square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone.
0.96 	 However, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun.
0.95 	 OMG this was the most painful experience of my life watching this.
0.88 	 I could even finish it what is happening to Nick.
0.99 	 Their best thing on teen Nick is Drake and Josh and thats about to go off air.
0.57 	 In short if your 3yrs old with no brain activity you'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now.
0.75 	 It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.<br /><br />Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see.
0.76 	 How can you improve on this?
1.0 	 They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie.
0.94 	 This film was done after that rescue.
1.0 	 All during, you couldn't help but think, "how bad was it before?"
0.69 	 Great script.
0.75 	 Can't believe this was the man's first film!
0.93 	 <br /><br />Is the plot over the top?
0.71 	 Yes.
0.71 	 Yes.
0.99 	 The bar is sleazy, the cops questionable.
0.8 	 Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.<br /><br />But despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of "The Little Mermaid" et al.<br /><br />So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie.
0.87 	 Ultimately, this is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency.
1.0 	 Yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one Milo Thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (Kida, the clichÃ©d Atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other.
0.99 	 But what I found was not as clichÃ©d as I was expecting.
0.97 	 There's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, "The Little Mermaid" (A good thing).<br /><br />You may have grasped that this is a rather clichÃ©d film.
0.89 	 Correct.
0.99 	 Numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear.
0.97 	 So what does it rely on?
0.98 	 You have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale Â need I go on?<br /><br />I don't know why this got to anyone Â I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing.
0.74 	 down.
0.58 	 From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat.
0.94 	 Miming has become something of a dying art, if it isn't already dead.
0.96 	 Miming points its silent finger at the ridiculousness of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd?
0.95 	 He is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self.
0.72 	 I also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels.
0.94 	 That is what humour does I suppose.
0.55 	 It is subjective.
0.83 	 This was made for them.<br /><br />I can't really say anymore other than to implore you to find this and watch it.
0.73 	 You won't be disappointed and in a world devoid of genteel humour, this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comedic brilliance.
0.97 	 As a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions.
0.69 	 Jon Bon Jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer.
0.5 	 Guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination.
0.96 	 I believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people, living in Mexico City concerning their sexual lives.
1.0 	 And so, I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican movie (in ages) that was both popular and interesting to watch.
0.97 	 The story presents us with two couples, both with very obvious marital problems.
0.97 	 When a third party comes into the life of each couple, their problems reach a pivotal point.
0.55 	 The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes.
1.0 	 SPyL has had an (impressive) good reception at the box-office.
0.61 	 10 out of 10!
0.72 	 Spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands.
0.98 	 And then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.<br /><br />Okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign.
0.88 	 This was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it.
0.77 	 A spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it.
0.94 	 I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film.
0.74 	 She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.<br /><br />I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren's early work.
0.58 	 I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess.
1.0 	 I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.<br /><br />As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at age 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage.
0.96 	 After all, we don't see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" back stage singing from behind the curtain!
0.69 	 Do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers.
1.0 	 One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product.
1.0 	 This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.<br /><br />The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality.
0.98 	 I was expecting to love this movie--film noir, serial killer, dark irony.
0.68 	 When this happens, The director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel.
0.89 	 The director Chang Cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death.
0.79 	 We actually care when people are killed in this film.
0.98 	 This is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed.
1.0 	 There is bad dubbing, The characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat.
0.82 	 I recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not.
1.0 	 The story was rather flat and clichÃ©..<br /><br />7/10
0.5 	 I kind of wish they'd kept this look, but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look, who am I to say they shouldn't have gone that route?!
0.88 	 Nice lady, huh?!
0.65 	 In the meantime, a huge rainstorm hits.
0.96 	 The land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge.
0.96 	 Cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks!
0.73 	 She tells him to get lost!
0.91 	 He obviously has little enthusiasm for this--and you feel sorry for the lady, as she did nothing wrong.
1.0 	 Because of the meddling of this nasty old lady, Garbo leaves--unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son.
0.83 	 So much for "won't rest until he has her for his wife", huh?!
0.99 	 Despite Cortez being a wimp through and through, for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him.
0.97 	 And so, he marries the Pork Queen and lives a very dull life.
0.95 	 And, not surprisingly, she tells him, once again, to get lost.<br /><br />At the time this film was made, Garbo was not a star in the US and Cortez was.
0.91 	 So, in light of this, it's surprising they gave Cortez such an unlikable character to play.
1.0 	 Instead of the usual confident Valentino-like role they'd been giving him, here he is an indecisive wimp--a HUGE wimp.
0.97 	 And, from here on, his career was on a slow downward spiral.
1.0 	 When Redmon questions Americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded.
0.99 	 When he told them that they are made in China for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, Americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth.
0.53 	 When Redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that Americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads.
0.96 	 The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it.
0.93 	 <br /><br />One has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in Germany at the time, and particularly at Riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:Triumph of the Will.
0.72 	 <br /><br />If only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout: "I can see!"
0.89 	 Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would want to be, a simpler time.
0.96 	 I have been learning about the Zodiac for four years now.
0.98 	 I enjoy watching it again and again.<br /><br />The only minus, and why I didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up.
0.57 	 You won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges.
0.97 	 This movie is stuffed full of stock Horror movie goodies: chained lunatics, pre-meditated murder, a mad (vaguely lesbian) female scientist with an even madder father who wears a mask because of his horrible disfigurement, poisoning, spooky castles, werewolves (male and female), adultery, slain lovers, Tibetan mystics, the half-man/half-plant victim of some unnamed experiment, grave robbing, mind control, walled up bodies, a car crash on a lonely road, electrocution, knights in armour - the lot, all topped off with an incredibly awful score and some of the worst Foley work ever done.<br /><br />The script is incomprehensible (even by badly dubbed Spanish Horror movie standards) and some of the editing is just bizarre.
0.62 	 In one scene where the lead female evil scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the badly dubbed: "That is fantastical.
0.83 	 I do not understand.
1.0 	 Explain to me again how this is..." exposition scenes that litter this movie, there is a sudden hand held cutaway of the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed for no apparent reason at all other than to cover a cut in the bad scientist's "Mwahaha!
0.54 	 All your werewolfs belong mine!"
0.62 	 speech.
1.0 	 Though why they went to the bother I don't know because there are plenty of other jarring jump cuts all over the place - even allowing for the atrocious pan and scan of the print I saw.<br /><br />The Director was, according to one interview with the star, drunk for most of the shoot and the film looks like it.
1.0 	 It is an incoherent mess.
1.0 	 It's made even more incoherent by the inclusion of werewolf rampage footage from a different film The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, featuring the same actor but playing the part with more aggression and with a different shirt and make up - IS there a word in Spanish for "Continuity"?)
0.69 	 The piano part was so simple it could have been picked out with one hand while the player whacked away at the gong with the other.)
0.88 	 <br /><br />This is one of the most bewilderedly trance-state inducing bad movies of the year so far for me.
0.72 	 This madness and perversity will turn against you!"
0.97 	 It seems as if destiny conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece.<br /><br />Pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elocution.
0.99 	 In this one Cash and his police Lt. buddy unravel a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch, and a family of screw-ups and their wierdo helpers.
0.95 	 Lee hosted the 100 Years of Horror for Ted Newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves.
0.58 	 Indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances.
1.0 	 The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter.
0.73 	 It was a film to be taken seriously.
0.87 	 It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes.
0.99 	 I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning's contributions.
0.93 	 Check out their site.
0.59 	 )<br /><br />To me, this movie is a good example of what NOT to do in filmmaking.
0.65 	 I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it.
0.57 	 I was surprised by how I was affected watching it.
0.56 	 Regardless of what you have heard about it.
0.98 	 This movie was really good, just TOO predictable.
1.0 	 And what horror movie doesn't have stupid people?
0.99 	 This one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken.
0.83 	 Pet Semetary I found to be creepy a little.
0.8 	 ), it just so happened that I was thumbing through the encyclopedias in the classroom one day, and under the entry for movies (or cinema, I don't remember), were several stills for different movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of them shown on the page was a still for OffOn.
0.55 	 After viewing it, it slightly wasn't was I was expecting it to be (it tended to be a more organic-looking film, not that that's a bad thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering the techniques Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including hand-tinting the film itself, and using video equipment for some of the film's scenes (filmed off of a video monitor), giving it a more distressed, lo-res look.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the techniques used in this film were quite ground-breaking for 1972.
1.0 	 Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it.
0.86 	 Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar.
0.93 	 But this has Sabertooth tigers instead.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt.
0.94 	 Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy.
0.7 	 While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching "Lost", I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1Âthe one with the polar-bearÂand it has had my undivided attention ever since.
0.79 	 Not the polar bear.
0.68 	 Where did they come from?
0.99 	 Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive) Â these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action.
0.98 	 <br /><br />About this plot...
0.58 	 Imagine a tree as the template plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for every character) Â well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines.
0.97 	 I would recommend anyone to look at this movie.
1.0 	 You will not be sorry.
0.94 	 It is well acted out, so real and never a dull moment.
0.61 	 This is why this movie is so appealing.
0.97 	 I find this movie one that I can watch over and over again and one that I never get tired of.
0.96 	 I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result.
0.99 	 It fits perfectly.
0.79 	 Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time.<br /><br />I enjoyed parts of this movie, I truly did, and once you get to the end of it, you'll actually figure out what's truly going on.
0.54 	 There's more!
0.96 	 *SPOILERS*<br /><br />I'm sure back when this was released in 1958 it was much appropriate for its time.
0.81 	 Here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife.
0.98 	 The gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed he film) really is an underappreciated character.
0.92 	 Jenni, we also find out, saw her parents die, thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to institutionalization.
0.55 	 It seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy.
0.61 	 On the one hand Trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour, but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that.
0.99 	 But this terrible cry - does that mean, that all will repeat again and again and again... that his soul is in a cage or something?
0.92 	 And these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff ?
0.99 	 The fact, that he/she looks like a mummy in the Hospital - thatÂ´s not an incident, but a clue in my point of view.
0.97 	 Chris Rock is not showing a good act here, you can't get the feeling that his caracter is real, I think the movie would have been a bit better if it's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more/better humor was involved.
0.98 	 In the "making of" they don't show a single smile.
0.75 	 I gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me, but I did never laugh!
1.0 	 Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah.
0.54 	 Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen.
1.0 	 Films like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful "The shop around the corner" and, of course the 1951 version of "Scrooge".
1.0 	 There's Frank Capra's classics "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe".
1.0 	 Hey, forget the classics.
1.0 	 What about "Home Alone" or " Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.?
0.92 	 <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice.
0.53 	 Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "Finding John Christmas".
0.92 	 Merry Christmas!
0.6 	 You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds.
0.63 	 The main character doing this with everything, everywhere, everytime is also not funny.
0.93 	 However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the HUMAN-romantic leads (does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too?
0.97 	 <br /><br />Well, I suppose the country did.
0.65 	 And they had one here.
0.64 	 The need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Albert Maltz may have overwritten the script, or it may have been altered by someone else.
0.98 	 It could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity.
0.99 	 Still, there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer -- "Why don't God strike me dead?"
0.98 	 <br /><br />Notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldn't: the dated vernacular which it's difficult to believe many of today's kids could think was actually ever spoken -- "private gab," "dope", "drip," "Gee," "you dumb coot," "dame," "a swell guy," and "feeling sorry for yourself."
0.99 	 At the time, some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge.
0.96 	 <br /><br />Real weak points?
0.99 	 The wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of, "Just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn't mean people will think you're a bad person."
1.0 	 There are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative.
0.64 	 "Please, God, let him return to me," and that sort of thing.
0.91 	 <br /><br />Well, the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times.
0.83 	 It's not on television that often.
0.72 	 The original title means "The Birth of the Octopuses".
0.88 	 I think that both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures.<br /><br />Much of the movie is water ballet.
0.96 	 Sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards, and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs, with which they will wave and kick in the air.
0.5 	 But we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that.
0.77 	 There is a scene in which Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag.
0.91 	 In it she finds an apple, mostly eaten.
0.89 	 This is about adult young females, and a clearly Lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman.
0.97 	 She also steals a garbage bag of the beloved, and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest.
0.91 	 <br /><br />Later Floriane tells Marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her.
0.69 	 Marie says she cannot do this.
0.91 	 And she masturbates on Floriane.
1.0 	 There is no nudity in this scene.
0.88 	 (The haircuts are left out of the discussion.)
0.93 	 That's basically a nitpick.<br /><br />And, it would have been impossible for Ben to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years.
0.98 	 Pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem as late as 1847, and the Gold Rush did not even begin until two years later.<br /><br />Indians are not played by Native American actors.
0.82 	 John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s.
0.91 	 The Bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later.
1.0 	 That is a major nitpick for me.<br /><br />There are other time-line problems.
0.85 	 There are continuity problems, over and over.<br /><br />It is somewhat off-putting, too, that there is so much killing in the first season.
0.96 	 It's a mere 70 minutes and doesn't feature many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck.
0.75 	 <br /><br />Stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the Mexican desert.
1.0 	 The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide.
1.0 	 'Trade' wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts.
1.0 	 I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause.
0.84 	 If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking.
1.0 	 What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis.<br /><br />You gather a bunch of your friends at home, all hyped about the follow up work of Sean Ellis.
1.0 	 You have an vague idea of the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations.<br /><br />It is late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type.<br /><br />15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up, at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches.
0.97 	 Over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day.<br /><br />A few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this, in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time.
0.98 	 Any other stuff I would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy.
0.82 	 Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween, which is done every year, but this year things are different.
0.92 	 I rented this DVD for two reasons.
0.99 	 A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss.
0.77 	 In this case, it was a big miss.
0.95 	 Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners.
1.0 	 Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini".
1.0 	 Yes, the ending is very nicely done, but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner.<br /><br />Of course, some people like it.
0.96 	 The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did!!
0.97 	 That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it.
0.55 	 This is not a blood and gore scary type movie, but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written.
0.7 	 Of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie.
0.85 	 And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many witches (besides me) have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion.
0.83 	 Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as his character is out of p;ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft.
0.98 	 We see Blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make Bladrick an M.P.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince.
0.99 	 Typically, "kids" films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13.
0.91 	 But then again, that's before Holes hit the scene.
0.88 	 The only down side?
0.99 	 The hokey looking lizards.
0.62 	 Overall, however, an 8/10.
0.6 	 One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s.
0.87 	 The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas.
0.76 	 Then, we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with Olivia de Havilland.
0.98 	 Among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it.
1.0 	 Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued.
0.99 	 It needed to be more like "The Good Earth", released just the year before.
0.99 	 Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as Errol Flynn.
0.71 	 Surely, Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title.
0.93 	 "Gold or Grain" is short and to the point.
0.88 	 Incidentally, I understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills', waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.
0.63 	 By estimating the sun spot activity.
0.62 	 Has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate?
0.96 	 So how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past?
1.0 	 How come the temperature in the entire universe has risen (relatively) equal much as on earth?
0.98 	 Does our SUVs cause temperature on Jupiter to rise?<br /><br />Use some common sense!
0.9 	 Please research it yourself.
0.98 	 What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (banking family that arranged live earth event) to gain from this?
0.9 	 <br /><br />I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use your own common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion!
0.94 	 He talks of having a "dialog" with the rocks and other materials that he works with, attempting to work *with* rather than against them.
0.95 	 It might be stones, or flowers, or leaves, or sticks.
0.99 	 The sculpture might last for minutes or years, or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed.
0.87 	 I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school.
0.99 	 !<br /><br />P.P.- I appologise of my bad / worst/ English !!
0.78 	 It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion.
0.87 	 This movie was tough as an after school special.
0.63 	 tidal waves!
0.65 	 earthquakes!
0.85 	 exploding cars!
0.59 	 This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds.
0.96 	 It is, and I collect such things, the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired.
0.86 	 It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.<br /><br />Lee, who always struck me as a smart, useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek.
0.69 	 I won't reinforce the insults by listing them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons, and dice.<br /><br />One good song by Ethel Waters (and a couple of bad ones), and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the IMDb scale.
0.92 	 like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons, but this is the absolute reverse.
0.85 	 i think for some reason, the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina.
0.84 	 i just wished they could have made more better ones.
0.9 	 it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left, it was longer good.
0.58 	 what i meant about the opening sequence is: the opening titles of seasons 1-3 shows Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen.
1.0 	 At the end, Sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing, then disappear.
0.72 	 I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'Death Trap" in a top 5 list of the best stage-to-movie adaptations ever.
0.54 	 But "Sleuth" is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits, and the house in "Sleuth" is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors - the house doesn't really have an equivalent in "Deathtrap".
0.86 	 You don't have to choose!
0.79 	 <br /><br />I won't give away the twists and turns of the plot, but I don't think it matters anyway.
0.5 	 I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family, only to be sickened to see the house a year later.
0.76 	 They don't even live there any more... they live "in town" and come out only for the weekend.
0.72 	 It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result.
0.69 	 "Black Angel" is minor whodunit, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance.
0.65 	 This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never achieving anything special.
1.0 	 It is pleasant enough but then, at some point, it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big "give me a break" reactions.
0.97 	 It's a shame that more people have not seen it.
0.97 	 Yet I wonder if I should call this a horror film.
0.92 	 The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period.
0.97 	 They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well.
0.98 	 Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable.
0.85 	 I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967.
0.7 	 I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered "controversial" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life.
0.87 	 In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States.
0.63 	 In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic.
0.93 	 While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema.
0.94 	 Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.
0.63 	 THHE remake was a superior movie remake in every way.
0.96 	 Most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of Alexandre Aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub-genre of horror is concerned.
0.52 	 We then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects.
0.94 	 Think the Marines in Aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained.
0.94 	 Also the one that took the cake was the Sloth-like Mutant (you know Sloth from the Goonies) who helps them out in the 3rd act.
0.96 	 I was waiting for him to ask for a Baby Ruth or start going on about Rocky Road Ice Cream.
0.51 	 Another major strike against this movie.
0.85 	 It should have been given another title and been added to the Saturday Night Line up on The Sci-Fi Channel.
0.51 	 !
0.96 	 I found about the movie "Holes" by hearing from people that it wasn't typical Disney, that both kids and adults both got into the story.
0.99 	 Folks, let me tell you I wasn't disappointed.
0.6 	 I didn't know quite what to expect when I watched it.
0.68 	 Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book.
1.0 	 This vulgur, obscence movie has utterly disgusting, eggotistical, and satirical content.
0.91 	 It portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals.
0.92 	 Corruption and greed and blackmail turn the sport sour, and its up ta Coop ta fix it.
0.52 	 Alot.
1.0 	 Absolute lowest common denominator humor.
0.77 	 Painful viewing.
0.88 	 He has it in him.
0.96 	 I remember stumbling upon this special while channel-surfing in 1965.
0.86 	 I had never heard of Barbra before.
0.85 	 You will not be disappointed in viewing this.
0.83 	 At least the ending is worth the wait, for those who will still care by that time.
0.69 	 Recap: According to legend, the Valkyrie Brunhilda defied Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire.
1.0 	 Only a warrior pure in heart can pass through the flames, free Brunhilda and release her from Odin's claim, and have her for himself.
1.0 	 Now, war is brewing in the Norse lands, and the King needs an alliance with the Berserkers.
0.99 	 The Berserkers are warriors claimed by Odin's valkyries, lusting for war, blood and flesh, and therefore outcasts, but superior in battle.
0.99 	 The leader of the Berserkers is a scorned son of the King, Boar, and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek.
0.85 	 But after the King is victorious in battle, he refuses to give up his only remaining son, breaking his oath to Boar and betray him and kill him.
0.72 	 But this is only the start of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to start now, a millennia later...<br /><br />Comments: I had hopes that this would be a movie based upon some Viking ground, far too little quality movie about Viking has been done.
0.99 	 It started out very good too, with detailed longships and armors, nice and fitting sceneries and an OK battle.<br /><br />The foundation in the Aesir myths is thin and seems very corrupted to me.
0.8 	 If the two brothers had fought it out in the correct time, with some decent battles, this movie would have been much better.
0.93 	 Now the setting, suddenly is changed to present day Stockholm.
0.94 	 Still, Odin is present and is sending Boar and his berserkers for Brunhilda and Barek which gives silly scenes when armor-clad and painted berserkers swordfights with Barek among the industries.
0.68 	 Beautiful mountains and woods have been exchanged for cement.
0.98 	 It draws very little from Aesir myth or Viking tradition.
0.56 	 Supposedly filmed entirely in South Africa, it still contains some familiar Swedish signs, plates and what seems to be an authentic police car.
0.88 	 No names are Swedish (perhaps with Anya as the exception), no familiar sceneries are Swedish, they (supposedly) speak a little (ancient?)
0.61 	 Norwegian, not Swedish.
0.66 	 <br /><br />4/10
0.69 	 I have lost count of how many reviews I've written on Slaughter High.
0.96 	 At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide.
1.0 	 Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses.
0.95 	 I always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie.
1.0 	 Must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least.
0.64 	 I first saw this movie when I was 12 in the sixth grade.
0.84 	 He looked like a teenager.
1.0 	 Probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business.
0.8 	 First of all, these ladies are NOT geisha, they are oiran (prostitutes)in the Yoshiwara-type "green houses", circa 1860, give or take..
0.98 	 This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware.
0.97 	 You won't be disappointed.
1.0 	 Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great.
0.99 	 The acting superb and the script should be awarded.
0.84 	 Original movie was kind of childish, and I was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the BSG new season.<br /><br />But after few episodes I became a fan.
0.94 	 It's about "we don't leave anybody behind".
0.6 	 It is much interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just either the priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising plots!
0.51 	 ).
0.99 	 When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball.
1.0 	 Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent.
1.0 	 She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough.
0.71 	 Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky.
0.85 	 He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable.
0.73 	 If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy.
0.99 	 The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this.
1.0 	 I love the film Annie, and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film, but i was so disappointed!
0.76 	 Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson.
0.64 	 The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.
0.92 	 On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted.
0.97 	 They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.
0.87 	 The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.
0.99 	 The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.
0.56 	 The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.
0.81 	 The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.
0.91 	 The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.
0.92 	 Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.
0.94 	 As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.
0.96 	 In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.
0.53 	 Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.
0.8 	 Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.
0.56 	 The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.
0.55 	 Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.
0.98 	 Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.
0.98 	 This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.
0.61 	 However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.
0.55 	 To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.
0.99 	 Marvin(Rob Schneider)does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream.
0.94 	 After this moment, he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be.
0.94 	 By the time, he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side.
1.0 	 In the mean time, he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised.
0.92 	 I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider.
0.86 	 In fact, this is the his first film I have seen.
1.0 	 However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser.
0.73 	 (See his part in Ally Mcbeal, quite funny actually).There are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat.
0.98 	 But very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office.
0.95 	 I wouldn't say this is a bad movie; in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the "poverty row" studios were releasing at the time.
0.97 	 Coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case.
1.0 	 I've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing.
0.66 	 I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we must make movies like "Left Behind."
0.99 	 As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as the perfect example for what I am not going to do with my career in film.
0.98 	 Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie "Sholay", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew.
0.51 	 After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company he pulled a Coppola (Godfather) on us; What were you thinking RGV?
0.88 	 Anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the Old sholay.
0.92 	 Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay,sholay).
0.97 	 Later in the movie, now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan.
0.91 	 In case you haven't been watching Bollywood movies, the Good guys win in the end.
1.0 	 And, oh that cute little girl too.<br /><br />The humour is at best, weak, and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign which employs the usual shock-tactic (esp in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e.
0.61 	 we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997', and THAT is how he got caught.
0.96 	 I suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all, a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean production film company.
0.91 	 Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc.
0.88 	 shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship.
0.9 	 The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well.
0.54 	 I had high hopes based on the trailer.
0.98 	 I thought that Stalone was going to be forced in his "has-been" days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting, and (believable) action would prevail.
1.0 	 I crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event.
0.59 	 The character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves.
0.87 	 Cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into Rambo before you can say "yo, Adrian!"
0.98 	 It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.<br /><br />And don't even start me on the 'lack' of chemistry between Helen and Paris.
0.98 	 She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other.
0.67 	 The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", set in the small rural town of ÃÃ¤nekoski.
0.8 	 The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life.
0.99 	 This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos, easier to take.
0.96 	 It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them.
0.76 	 I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction.
0.99 	 There's plenty of wire'fu stunts, too, and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films, I cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic, freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give.
0.93 	 Another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason.
0.99 	 That is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies.
0.99 	 People just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element.
0.9 	 And as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending,which they do not!<br /><br />There is one bright spot to this film- LOST star Maggie Grace as the female lead.
0.62 	 Now that I've seen it I wish it upon no living soul on the planet.
0.85 	 The movie was much better than the other reviewer stated.
0.75 	 Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances.
0.94 	 It seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and it's pretty much PG or G rated.
0.97 	 It reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war.
0.95 	 The characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave.
0.96 	 Searing bit of dialog between two Generals: "Does God exist?"
0.99 	 "If He did, we wouldn't."
0.94 	 ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Juggernaut is a British made "thriller" released in the US by First National.
0.94 	 She knows Karloff needs the money.<br /><br />Karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband.
0.63 	 However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed.
0.7 	 Karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man Who Lived Again.
0.95 	 This movie i have been dying to see.
0.83 	 It was completely worth it.
0.51 	 This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end.
0.89 	 If ur lookin for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up then this is one u can't pass over.
0.77 	 As I have the experience of seeing f18's and f14's being mysteriously transformed into f16's, this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me.
0.97 	 There is no special agency involved in the plot.
0.94 	 This is the clue!
0.7 	 This is a PRIVATE plot, built as a PRIVATE enterprise.
0.91 	 Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money.
0.78 	 All can be done just by delegation.
0.84 	 The "director" must be just trigger.
0.99 	 If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered.
0.91 	 Even less it was available at my local video store.<br /><br />Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000$ budget.
0.83 	 Things haven't changed much.
0.98 	 The plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance.<br /><br />It must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the Nazis - well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to Britain from third columnists.<br /><br />But Arthur Askey was so annoying & unfunny you just wanted him to shut up - well at least I did !
1.0 	 I suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome.
0.95 	 If he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded.<br /><br />A good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes - a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like; uncomfortable slow, dirty trains, being thrown off for no reason, surly staff ....
0.86 	 Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy?
0.79 	 I am extremely picky about the films I see.
0.94 	 I'd heard about Moon Child completely by accident.
0.77 	 She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money.
0.98 	 One day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla.
0.98 	 Knowing nothing about the large apes, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life.
0.52 	 She's a tall, intimidating Amazon of a woman.
0.8 	 And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. Togar, with sneering relish.
0.97 	 Basically the Duke cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time driving very fast in "The General Lee".
0.88 	 They get help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being chased by equally mean Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C.
0.7 	 Gainey) and the police.
0.83 	 Also starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline.
0.98 	 I think the only reason I give the film an extra star is because of a couple of impressive car stunts, and of course the gorgeous body of Simpson (I'll admit her legs aren't quite Catherine Bach, but still!
1.0 	 This should tell you all you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor," Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the inner city.
0.58 	 Now, she's a C.I.A.
0.93 	 Interviewer: What past job experience do you have?
0.54 	 Come on Tina Fey you can do better then this.
0.83 	 Sure it was funny at times.
0.7 	 Even laugh out loud funny.
0.58 	 At the most i recommend renting it but thats all.
0.76 	 Baby Mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for.<br /><br />Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team.
1.0 	 Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies.
0.99 	 Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did great in that and they do good in this.
0.97 	 But this isn't there best.
1.0 	 Baby Mama had a great supporting cast.
0.81 	 Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the casts greatness.<br /><br />Another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world.
0.96 	 After the great Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average when compared.
1.0 	 Knocked Up and Juno are Hilarious, Heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face.
0.89 	 I recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious.
0.65 	 I give Baby Mama.....<br /><br />4/10
0.93 	 Along his training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures.
0.76 	 In the very last twist, I recalled Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall".
0.78 	 This movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once, and I really did not like the last scene, when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea.
0.86 	 Four astronauts take on this journey: a military type played by Gerald Mohr, a poor man's Humphrey Bogart who enjoys saying the word "Irish" and has the acting savvy of a codfish, then there is Naura Hayden, a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves, next, Les Tremaine, a wonderful character actor from cheap sci-fi films like this as the egghead, and last, Jack Kruschen as Sammy - the guy from Brooklyn with jokes and doesn't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics.
0.64 	 None of these performers are really any good, and all of them say their dialog with little conviction.
1.0 	 Really, the best out of the four is Kruschen - and that really says a lot about this film.
0.56 	 The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye.
0.52 	 Whew!
0.93 	 There is a nice drawing of a Martian city, but there just was not enough of this in the film.
0.7 	 Despite all these big problems, The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film.
1.0 	 It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization.
0.76 	 Director Ib Melchior gives an interesting look to much of the film even with the budgetary constraints, but the story by him and Sid Pink doesn't fly.
0.98 	 And how bout that ending with the music and the psychedelic colors?
0.68 	 Groovy man!
0.53 	 This film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming.
0.82 	 Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka (1939).'
0.91 	 I never tire of watching it.
0.99 	 Grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter, discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place, restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide.
0.73 	 Though Allen doesn't see anything out of the ordinary, Julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn't quite right.
0.84 	 A local handyman, Jim Payne(Scott Hodges), a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the Pykes.
0.99 	 Meanwhile the neighbors who sold the Pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well, alcoholic Mr Booth's abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him.
0.61 	 I guess it's supposed to be this way, under their circumstances, but the trouble I had was never being able to properly embrace the Pykes due to their constant state of aloofness.
1.0 	 I think the right performers, even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil, can grab the hearts of their viewers, if a humanity reaches out to us..in this movie's case, the leads are unable to do so, for whatever reason.
0.94 	 I wanted to care for them, but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings.
0.95 	 Anyway, as the film continues, Allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won't lose her little girl again.
0.92 	 Jim, the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the Pykes, becomes a vital threat.
1.0 	 The ghosts remain a central part of the movie, their presence, particularly Jim's mother, established throughout, off in the distance.
0.99 	 The finale reveals all of them as Allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart Jim's mission.
0.98 	 I had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters.
0.98 	 Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way.
1.0 	 Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad.
0.94 	 The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters.
0.98 	 It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is.
0.78 	 I'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure.
0.72 	 Luckily I saw this on free TV.
0.84 	 My family is from the southeast region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles).
0.99 	 All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenery and music.
0.6 	 I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles, and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things Cajun, please have the actors study the language, live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them.
0.97 	 In my opinion, when the actors make you believe they are that person, it's a much more enjoyable movie!
0.84 	 And it's not just mindless fun.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Like I said, this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies, eighties, and nineties.
1.0 	 And to speak of, it's not really dirty or disgusting either.
0.63 	 Only PG rated.
0.87 	 I grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there.
1.0 	 It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's, and the same goes for the music.
0.93 	 And the acting was top-notch throughout: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were present.
0.99 	 He was hampered in directing this film by the producer.
0.99 	 Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either.
0.5 	 It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday.
0.88 	 The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work.
0.99 	 Attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls, assuming that they are trying to get their "big break" in show business, rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working "gypsies" living show to show, along with a couple of newcomers.
0.95 	 Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film.
0.96 	 And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with "How about a light?"
0.96 	 I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil the movie.
0.53 	 9 out of 10!
0.97 	 First one was much better, I had enjoyed it a lot.
0.96 	 This one has not even produced a smile.
0.99 	 In short:<br /><br />Spike Lee clearly has a lot on his mind.
1.0 	 He's thinking about racism color-ism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'hetero-sexism', politics of the drug war etc etc...<br /><br />That level of consciousness on is own is great.
1.0 	 I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies.
0.69 	 And so he exhausts stereotypes and we are left with rushed testimonies and very loaded dialogs.
0.63 	 The end result is very staged and unrealistic.<br /><br />Secondly, by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of societal functions, he appears to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social/political issues presented.
0.73 	 You feel that he bought an elementary level sociology text book and spewed out all 500 pages.<br /><br />These are highly problematic features because the artistry of film is sacrificed and the work is transformed into a loudspeaker for the voice of the voice of the filmmaker.
0.9 	 He is unable to distance himself from the work, and allow it to speak for itself.<br /><br />It functions neither as a piece of art nor a sound political argument.<br /><br />Although I still do appreciate Lee bringing up these important issues, I must say:<br /><br />Two thumbs down.
0.87 	 He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think that they could have found someone better!
0.99 	 I don't think that they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie!
0.55 	 That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there.
0.84 	 However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory.
0.9 	 I've played the game.
0.95 	 3/10<br /><br />Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity
0.97 	 A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.
0.87 	 When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live.
0.89 	 The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.<br /><br />This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made "Wrong Turn" (a film I have not seen).
0.9 	 My apologies to him for my underestimation.
0.88 	 Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about.
0.61 	 However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film.
0.72 	 I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than "Hellraiser 2".<br /><br />Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look.
1.0 	 I didn't watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had (not that it's confusing).
0.81 	 He's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will.
0.95 	 I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he's completely unlovable.<br /><br />While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and I'm excited about the "Washingtonians" episode, I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine.
0.82 	 (i have a review on that too that you could check it out.)
0.6 	 actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath, its your everyday doctor.
0.98 	 got some good actors and actresses in this movie, though some where unappreciated like Virginya Keehne as Sarah.
0.8 	 Ken Foree who you might recognize from rob zombie's devils rejects and Halloween(2007) co-stars as our detective on schizoid Dr. Alan Feinstone's(Corbin Benson)trail.
0.59 	 Two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief.
0.99 	 This is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey.'
0.94 	 After seeing such classics as 'Every Which Way But Loose' and 'Project X,' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome.<br /><br />These guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie.
0.71 	 Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys thought.<br /><br />Maybe a strong sidekick would help like a Jackie Chan or heck maybe even Hulk Hogan.
1.0 	 Luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet Li look-a-like Matthew Modine.
0.9 	 Is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie?
0.86 	 But this isn't a thriller, per se.
0.54 	 It felt more like I was watching a guy (Williams), as he was actually performing the actions, from a third person perspective.
0.6 	 In other words, it felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a watch, though it's definitely not Friday/Saturday night fare.<br /><br />It rates a 7.7/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
0.86 	 It doesn't deserve the name American Pie.
0.68 	 When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series.
0.93 	 It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies.<br /><br />I don't recommend it ever.
0.99 	 Actually i don't recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies.
0.9 	 Just stick with the nice original trilogy.<br /><br />2/10
0.81 	 This film has slipped through the cracks of film history.
0.77 	 Yet it is the flip side of that earlier effort and approached with just as much in your face machismo.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film has not been made available on either DVD or VHS in the United States.
0.79 	 From their collective output, only a few movies (or may I say just one?)
0.66 	 made an impact at the box office.
0.95 	 Richard Gere and Claire Danes pair up ala David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, only that they don't belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms, but are employees of Protective Services, who's chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their jurisdiction, are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time.
1.0 	 Hence they are the shepherds tending to their flock, only that their flock suffer from sick sexual perversion with the propensity for violence.<br /><br />The parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious, that it's just a cosmetic touch up on the outside.
0.94 	 Pained by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child, just like how Mulder pines for his missing sister, Babbage is shunned by colleagues and given the marching orders disguised as a retirement plan.
0.93 	 He has deep disgust for the people he's monitoring, sick of their crimes and what they stand for, that he has no qualms in using unorthodox methods, short of flying off the handle while dishing out illegal, preemptive punishment.
0.8 	 It's a decent investigative drama with the usual red herrings, and my, are they really good ones as it made you wonder quite often if your guesses are correct, and you soon find yourself firing from the hip as you get proved incorrect at alarming frequency, though I don't credit this to a tight narrative, but more from the sprawling number of characters (watch out for Avril Lavigne's cameo) and sub plots.
0.72 	 It does take a little while to get used to this, and I put this effect as one which actually distracts from what is happening in the story.
0.51 	 Not a really good move though, with somewhat frequent repetition of scenes involving flashbacks.<br /><br />But The Flock still makes decent entertainment, though X-philes out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles, given so much similarities in character.
0.99 	 Contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous.
0.78 	 Kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director.
0.67 	 (um.
0.75 	 No thanks) <br /><br />His future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot.
0.78 	 The plague is coming!
0.88 	 But here's an atypical Richard Widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable Barabra bel Geddes, with her bathos turned way down (well, for her); they're a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones.
0.77 	 I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found 'The Mind's Eye' again.
0.94 	 First of all, the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being "altered".
0.94 	 Well guess what?
1.0 	 Well enough ranting.
0.7 	 Like a latter day Ayn Rand, Bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough American hombres stuck in Iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless, relentless, child-killing Arab terrorists.
0.5 	 The war lover can only fully function in war, peacetime suffocates him.
1.0 	 While Hershey chastised the war lover, (played in the film by Steve McQueen in one of his greatest roles) Bigelow glorifies him.
0.98 	 The army needs war lovers, they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies.
1.0 	 We can't handle the truth, that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers, the toughest men.
0.95 	 According to the unironic Bigelow, regular men are pussies, the war lover is a special breed, the last of the cowboys.
0.98 	 He is a throwback to the sex-and-death cult of war.
0.6 	 Bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham-fisted attempt at realism.
0.9 	 Only a war-lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong, between American innocence and Arab perfidy.
0.81 	 She's just another gung-ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit.<br /><br />On the political front, Bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichÃ©s again and again, ad nauseam: the wonderful world of the open frontier, which happens to be some one else's country.
0.99 	 You name it, Bigelow resurrects it.<br /><br />The man-boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute Arab boy who befriends the war lover, but Bigelow plays it straight; she doesn't consummate the sex, just sanitizes it.
0.93 	 She glorifies war, she canonizes the sadist nut-case hero.
0.82 	 In Bigelow's world, though, no mercy or understanding ever makes it through.
0.98 	 The Iraqis are dehumanized par excellence.
0.93 	 The slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle.
0.94 	 Every U.S, bullet finds its mark.
0.99 	 You have to love the guy, the war lover.
1.0 	 It's just his way, he is the true hero.
0.88 	 He's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way, and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side.
0.82 	 Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas' character, "Pete Garrison," they think HE's the mole but he isn't.
0.98 	 Since he's doing that, he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the President.<br /><br />"Garrison" is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the President.
0.68 	 When he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot.
0.89 	 Are there holes in it?
0.86 	 However, it is unfairly bashed here.
0.95 	 It just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website.
0.56 	 The "parody" aspect is strained at best.
0.96 	 But that scared face she makes - scary in itself.
1.0 	 It has its moments, but not enough of them.<br /><br />HOWEVER, thanks to a certain Mike Nelson and his two robot pals, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy THEY got hold of ("The film jumped, and it was really scary!
0.91 	 <br /><br />Go on give it a go............ you won't be disappointed.
0.79 	 <br /><br />I have not seen another movie like this.
0.98 	 Smita Patil does not play a main role, but her part is also not distracting from the main plot.
0.78 	 Anyway, the film is fun for a while, but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.88 	 Steven Spielberg wanted to win an Oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics (he was nominated for three of them: "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and "E.T.
0.65 	 So he decided to get very serious by directing "The Color Purple", a period film with no special effects.
0.7 	 But the Academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give Spielberg any respect.
1.0 	 It got worse on Oscar night when this film didn't win a single Oscar.
0.98 	 It got completely shut out.
0.92 	 That wasn't right.
0.56 	 It also made me laugh at times too.
0.95 	 But he should have gotten nominated for this movie.
0.84 	 The job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like "E.T."
0.52 	 The plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying conclusion for it all.
0.54 	 The cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.<br /><br />Still I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations.
0.95 	 The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is pretty good too, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here.
0.92 	 A missed opportunity for sure.
0.51 	 <br /><br />Definitely one of the lesser man-creature flicks out there.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
0.7 	 I missed it on the first run choosing to see the other film.
0.89 	 Later, on repeat, I saw I made the right choice.
1.0 	 The movie is not really bad, but, really lacks any chills or surprises.
0.74 	 Although, I did like the scene where Richard Crenna shoots the family dog to no avail.
0.99 	 It's sort of hard for me to say it, because I so greatly enjoyed both "Targets" and "Paper Moon", but I thought "The Last Picture show" was a somewhat fascinating but overly self-indulgent film.
1.0 	 Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography.
0.78 	 But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that).
0.95 	 The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about.
1.0 	 It was like "American Graffiti" without the joy of life.<br /><br />Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess.
0.97 	 Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses.
1.0 	 But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.<br /><br />It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth.
0.56 	 We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show.
1.0 	 First we see Vincente Minnelli's "Father of the Bride" -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's "real life" surroundings in a similar way.
1.0 	 Later, clips from Howard Hawks' "Red River" emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protÃ©gÃ©.
0.97 	 It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in "Targets".
0.99 	 Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation.
1.0 	 Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the '50s.
0.61 	 He has a burning desire to see two people have sex.
1.0 	 Who are the best people he has in mind?
0.89 	 Well, his own mom and stepfather of course!
0.99 	 How pleasant.
0.79 	 Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife.<br /><br />Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex.
1.0 	 Then Lenny makes a new friend.
0.98 	 Him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls.
0.98 	 The problem is...it's not done in an innocent, charming 1950's sort of way.
0.51 	 1/10
0.99 	 I was not disappointed.
0.69 	 That would be like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa.
0.99 	 I've now seen this film twice, and I must say I enjoyed it both times.
0.77 	 This is not idle Fulci sycophancy, the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout, and you can tell who directed what, particularly in Mattei's case.<br /><br />The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist, it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind) somewhere in south east Asia.
0.91 	 They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all.
0.64 	 Martial arts skills aren't their only talents either, they are well versed in guerilla tactics, hiding on rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves.
0.99 	 This is all definitely the work of Mattei.<br /><br />There is a third, more chatty, variety of zombie.
0.98 	 This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'I'm really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD'.
0.54 	 Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace.
0.93 	 <br /><br />There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however.
0.99 	 In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage.
0.97 	 Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor, all shot in an atmospheric diffused light.
1.0 	 His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film.
1.0 	 The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak, and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance.
0.99 	 There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead, and this is quite tense.
0.99 	 Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs.
0.6 	 If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties.
0.92 	 Now look, I won't lie to you, but I only got this movie for $3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth" in it.
1.0 	 I expected of course violence and gore at its finest, as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as, amongst a plot line.<br /><br />But dear god, I was oh so wrong.
0.9 	 Being a low budget film (haha, wait, make that ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects.
0.74 	 Usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it.
0.93 	 The film looks like it was shot by a D+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes....sometimes, less is more buddy.
0.51 	 P.S.
0.82 	 NONE FOR YOU!
0.51 	 !
0.69 	 A wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry...definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system.
0.96 	 The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy...ninja... puberty-stricken... pre-thirty year old student...non-cowboy drawing...wise-cracking...son-of-a-bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year.
0.99 	 ", meaning "Don't gossip!".
0.95 	 Snafu short "Rumors", you see that it's not quite a laughing matter.
1.0 	 In this case, the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States.
0.99 	 One thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great, inspiring film.
0.7 	 Jamie Lee Curtis, in an early non-horror film role, demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but it isn't getting much better).<br /><br />I'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball!
0.99 	 The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate.
0.97 	 It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries.
0.99 	 There is some merit in this view, but it's also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition.
0.9 	 Guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's just the first ten minutes.
0.97 	 <br /><br />This action-packed film involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent.
0.92 	 <br /><br />There's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story: Busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" American military elites and return a high-tech "supertank" (a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top) back to the States.
0.83 	 <br /><br />But does America deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys?
1.0 	 This question is asked, of course, like in any film centering on the CIA... but without getting preachy.
1.0 	 The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Hough's less than perfect, but interesting, fictionalised account of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark.
0.66 	 Whoever edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on DVD has done a hell of a good job.
0.87 	 moments.
0.88 	 I guess that's where some of the cuts were made.<br /><br />Historicaly interesting.
0.63 	 no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did.
0.77 	 during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head.
0.76 	 evil, evil men.
0.79 	 Larry Buchanan.
0.87 	 Such a pretty little girl.
1.0 	 Though I don't like the part where she had to smoke; I hope it was only a fake prop.
0.97 	 Luckily I glanced in the downward direction that this movie was in!
0.57 	 I thought to myself, 'Awe, look at her!'
0.83 	 I read the plot on the back and then thought that, well, maybe I'd look it up on IMDb first and then come back and rent it at a later time.
0.94 	 I'm glad I didn't, because I certainly would have been missing out.
0.83 	 Also the actor who played Carol's father, who's name is unfortunately not listed on the site.
1.0 	 Music agent or producer comes in, thinks that she is awesome asks her to race.
1.0 	 Flash to war hero, back from war, has several fights, and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone.
0.96 	 Drive off in fast exotic car.
0.88 	 Brother races, then dies.
0.97 	 Hero to avenge death, cut away to getting weapons from friend.
0.75 	 (You have never seen this friend before or after, but seems to really care about him) Are you sure you want to do this; Yes; I mean are you really sure; Yes, give me weapons; are you REALLY sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can't talk you out of it, be careful man, I love you.<br /><br />Now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove.
0.85 	 Race is not even that exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and one that should win throws in a surprise ending.<br /><br />OK, I just saved you $7.00.
0.98 	 You can send all of your money to me, because I should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does.
0.6 	 The book "Morvern Callar" has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words.
0.55 	 I'm not sure I can, myself, but perhaps it comes to this, or something like it: Things come, things go, such is life, but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like Morvern--do.
0.56 	 The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and doesn't substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.<br /><br />This is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated.
0.96 	 In any case, despite my irritation at the author, I couldn't deny that his book stuck with me; and what I couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait.
0.52 	 Morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough.
0.94 	 The complex of incidents and of Morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, I can see this.<br /><br />The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen.
0.9 	 An actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is Angharad Rees, from the old TV series "Poldark".
0.96 	 It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so Morvern's responses (whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood) are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story.
0.97 	 In short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art TV film, and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross.
0.86 	 Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly.<br /><br />Alice is back and she's carrying a child, she couldn't be happier with her life.
0.75 	 But Freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie.
0.88 	 But anyways, he wants her child and to be born into the world again.
0.55 	 Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this commonplace movie???!!!
0.69 	 I can NOT believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen!
0.76 	 For all the haters out there, here is a message, Carlos is here to stay, you have no point in trying to bring him down.
0.84 	 And there is only one time when I have really cried and that was when I saw this movie.
0.92 	 This movie has some kliches but I really don't care.
0.88 	 I cry even as I write this and it was quite some time since I saw it.
0.83 	 I know how sentimental I sound and I promise I'm not usually like that.
1.0 	 I'm quite a cynic.
0.62 	 I've never witnessed this before.
0.71 	 Positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements.
1.0 	 But the intestines scene is classic.
0.98 	 By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European?
0.73 	 Western?)
0.69 	 suburbs.
0.94 	 This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value.
0.93 	 If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes.
0.98 	 i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c. scott and alistair sim.
0.91 	 i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful.
0.99 	 albert finney sings fairly well in annie.
0.59 	 Tarzan!
0.93 	 ", there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status.<br /><br />4/10
0.81 	 They decided on making it into a film for general distribution.<br /><br />I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film.
0.99 	 Watching him run naked though the woods was a howl.
1.0 	 Though every scene he's in is awesome.
0.95 	 Especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo.<br /><br />What's incredible about this movie is the plot.
0.74 	 Hey, it's an independent movie, with a shoe-string budget, so, ya, it's going to look a bit cheesy (if your standard is A-list Hollywood fare).
0.99 	 The answer to all these questions is an unqualified "yes."
0.87 	 The viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship.<br /><br />CONTENT VALUE.
0.86 	 This is achieved in a subplot where the zoo-keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies.
0.91 	 The only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake-poison.
0.94 	 The poison is like sin; the cure is like Christ's blood, shed on the cross.
1.0 	 To criticize this film for being explicitly Christian is absurd; it's akin to criticizing a Nike commercial for promoting sport-wear.
1.0 	 What else would evangelical Christian movie makers make, if not a film that states their case?
0.87 	 How do I know?
0.55 	 I plan on showing it to my teen group at church.
0.77 	 I could only find it on Region 2, a Spanish import, and it was expensive.<br /><br />Was it worth it?
0.83 	 Well, yes.
0.96 	 She accepts, a little gloomily.
0.98 	 The drummer in the band, Cook, leers at the silent lady but gets no response.
0.78 	 Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it, and she doesn't want to know his.
0.81 	 If she'd been a Longfellow devotee she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.<br /><br />Okay, Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence.
0.63 	 The head police officer, Gomez, turns him over to the DA.
0.99 	 His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver ("Al Alp"), not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared, it's impossible to dig her up.<br /><br />Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die.
1.0 	 But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story.
0.97 	 The ominous bartender is run over by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture.
1.0 	 The hot-tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway.
0.93 	 His sweaty face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous, orgasmic insanity.
0.94 	 His eyeballs roll to the ceiling, his mouth gapes, his hammering becomes frenzied.
0.96 	 He's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi.
0.94 	 Even when he faints he's decorous.
0.89 	 I don't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part.
0.84 	 Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture.
0.96 	 A man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it.
0.81 	 He pays them to take him to the border Â but things get out of hand.<br /><br />It starts well enough, but quickly struggles and dies.<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />The eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe.
0.96 	 I like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching this--and before we saw the rating-we said, "There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences.
0.73 	 It's possible to make a good film like that (and Away from Her is an example), but this was amateur hour.
0.95 	 There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one.
0.99 	 Watch The Family Stone.
0.98 	 Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs.
0.88 	 He's known throughout the world as a globetrotting TV reporter.
0.6 	 Less well-known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full-time philanderer.<br /><br />I saw `Vivre pour Vivre' dubbed in English with the title 'Live for Life.'
0.89 	 Some life!
0.74 	 Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: one mistress on her way out, one on her way in, and the cheated wife at home.
1.0 	 Among his most useful lies are `I'll call you tomorrow' and `My work took longer than planned.'
0.99 	 His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women.
1.0 	 When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal.<br /><br />Annie Girardot is the standout performer in this film.
1.0 	 Hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection.
1.0 	 It was also nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of her career.
0.91 	 I can't find fault with Yves Montand's performance of what was basically an amoral bum.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of Claude Lelouch's novel techniques.
0.63 	 In a hotel room scene, the camera pans around the room as Robert and his mistress argue.
0.79 	 Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news, but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train.
1.0 	 I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa.
0.98 	 The cinematography of those scenes and of those in Amsterdam was superb.<br /><br />I reviewed this movie as part of a project at the Library of Congress.
0.74 	 I've named the project FIFTY: 50 Notable Films Forgotten Within 50 Years.
0.98 	 As best I can determine, this film, like the other forty-nine I've identified, has not been on video, telecast, or distributed in the U.S. since its original release.
0.87 	 In my opinion, it is worthy of being made available again.<br /><br />
0.94 	 A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room at FYE.<br /><br />The skits are all very short, and yet most of them are still too long.
0.92 	 Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something.
0.61 	 Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie.
0.99 	 (As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.)
0.99 	 Classic?
0.51 	 3/10
0.52 	 There's quite the violence quotient in store, even though gore per se feels toned down in places, and adult language only makes a token appearance.
0.99 	 Once more, no nudity, leading one to conclude Cat III's are being handed these days a bit hastily.
0.91 	 Her unnamed character (lots of anonymity in this one) meets Edison's at a strangely deserted landfill, abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape.
0.73 	 Like so many films, this isn't Shawshank.
0.92 	 But it's a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film.
0.51 	 If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer, than I think you'll like it.<br /><br />Judging from the IMDb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was "vote bombed" with many 1s, as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob, don't have special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters.<br /><br />It's an American film, but it's not a US film.
0.99 	 The characters were easy on the eyes.<br /><br />I do agree the title sucks.
0.92 	 I don't remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an "s".
1.0 	 Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on.
0.65 	 Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing.
1.0 	 This movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film.
0.98 	 But it absolutely did not work for me.<br /><br />Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son, born and raised in New York in the 1920's, suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent.
0.75 	 He even takes the piss out of his American audiance at times and most of them didnt even realise it!
0.53 	 9 out of 10.
0.6 	 If any style of film could be called my "guilty pleasure", it'd be this generic fantasy type.
0.85 	 On that note, DeNiro's performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching DeNiro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting).
0.9 	 I can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to.
0.99 	 After the failure of "The Crusades" at the box office, Cecil B. DeMille stopped doing films about non-American history.
0.65 	 It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of Maximillian and his French controlled forces in Mexico against Juarez).
0.92 	 But he had been involved in actual problems with the West.
1.0 	 Cooper turning it into a minor mantra, like Lincoln's version of the Monroe Doctrine, is ridiculous...typical of the way DeMille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them.<br /><br />However, this is not a ruinous mistake.
0.99 	 The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually scared me.
1.0 	 Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods.
0.77 	 And that is the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective.<br /><br />There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing.
0.73 	 I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo.<br /><br />
0.69 	 Terrible direction.
0.91 	 It's a rather good movie, but too Americanised in it's predictability.
0.96 	 I wanted so much to enjoy this movie.
0.5 	 What happened to the story?
0.91 	 The music soars, but for a different film, not this one....for soap opera saga possibly.
0.94 	 This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an audience.<br /><br />The idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story.
0.95 	 Despite the excellent cast, this is an unremarkable film, especially from the aviation perspective.
1.0 	 "Blue Max" remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously.
0.87 	 Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed.
0.82 	 But there are lots of shallow movies in Hollywood nowadays, you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it.
0.99 	 I'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood rubbish we had been watching.
0.9 	 But, ever hopeful, I stayed.
0.91 	 I would call the use of color stunning, and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary.
0.54 	 That is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but that will be coming up later.<br /><br />Actually, the documentary-esquire portions were the best parts of it.
0.82 	 Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and lets not forget the giant turd.<br /><br />Matthew Barney has written that this is about "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity."
0.98 	 But, its supposed to be Modern art.
1.0 	 Obviously, the ramp is symbolic of the need for self-elevation to whatever standards you hold dear, and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom.
0.91 	 When it is the spinal column, its the "important" parts of the movie, or the backbone so to speak.
0.57 	 SO, they put patches on his head.
0.61 	 They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese wise man, who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it; a crash or intersection, if you will.
0.79 	 This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to start cutting each other's legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person.
0.77 	 They intersect.
0.88 	 Oh, did I forget to mention that this has been done in a Robbie Williams video?
0.88 	 Barney made it through 8th grade geometry, obviously.
0.61 	 At times it is hypnotic, but at others you just want to assassinate her.<br /><br />Art film is one thing, but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people, it becomes a self-destructive joke.
0.98 	 Un Chien Andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour.<br /><br />So, can I recommend this?
0.92 	 After seeing the low-budget shittier versions of the "Universal Soldier" franchise, I hoped and prayed that Van Damme reprised his role as Luc Devoreaux in a second Unisol movie.
1.0 	 Universial Soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library.
0.97 	 No, even that would be more intriguing .
0.94 	 That and having former WCW tough-guy legend "Goldberg" playing the villain.
0.93 	 How is that possible?
0.71 	 Tell me that!
0.98 	 Where's the gritty thrills in which a Unisol goes berserk an re-enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its Desert Storm or something ?
0.89 	 <br /><br />From what I seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and hell, even the cheap-ass/no class Terminator knock-off "Class of 1999" is more entertaining than this!
0.75 	 Major Payne was really not very good at all.
0.52 	 But after watching this I felt astonished.
0.95 	 The movie is like a punch in the stomach and I would really wish that things are not like this.
0.85 	 The problem of this guy is not that he is an ex-convicted.
0.74 	 The problem is that he is not one of these people.
0.87 	 And also speaks about the apathy of the people, because there are some people who are against the hunting of the King, but they do not dare to say their opinion.
0.99 	 In the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like God says, but at the same time acting so unfairly to the King.
0.86 	 In the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them.
0.96 	 Six different couples.
0.99 	 Six different love stories.
1.0 	 Six different love angles.
0.9 	 Don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
0.86 	 I do think kids can enjoy it, but to me it's the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through.
0.91 	 Zero stars.
0.99 	 "Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories.
0.99 	 Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills.
0.97 	 Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization.
0.99 	 The opening and closing are startling.
0.89 	 Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together again.
0.9 	 Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s.
0.75 	 But here's the spooky thing.
0.51 	 Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles, Durbin looks much older, as in adult.
0.92 	 And so do all of her so-called siblings.
0.72 	 So you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women.
0.84 	 And and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10.
1.0 	 In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy Â the best thing he's ever done.
0.85 	 The four crooks Â that's right, four!
0.59 	 And one of them is a girl!
1.0 	 Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!
0.75 	 You'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilising the same old routines, but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for 'Home Alone 4'.
0.78 	 (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this...my sister lives in Austin, where you live.....and she was supposed to buy you a drink once...well...she kinda stood you up...but she didn't mean to!
0.79 	 :C)
1.0 	 I can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear-jerking.
0.91 	 For one, it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes.<br /><br />How can these families afford to maintain these new mega-houses?
0.62 	 The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing.<br /><br />"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat.
0.99 	 If you like reality television, "Survivor" is far superior and moving.
1.0 	 The Robin Cook novel "Coma" had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978.
1.0 	 The only reason it escapes a 1-out-of-10 rating is that the Egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself.
1.0 	 Hamdi befriends Erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge.
1.0 	 Consequently, he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of Pharoah Seti I that he is keeping secretly in his shop.
1.0 	 The very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in Erica, for it could provide vital clues in locating Seti I's long-lost tomb, a prize as great as the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922.
0.9 	 Before Hamdi can tell Erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop, with Erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end.
0.99 	 Afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen, Erica attempts to track down the treasure.
1.0 	 She finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties, none of whom are truly trustworthy.
0.96 	 For one there is Yvon (Maurice Ronet), seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives?
0.96 	 Never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words.
0.95 	 Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?<br /><br />
0.7 	 I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average.
1.0 	 I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler.
0.84 	 Or did they ?
0.7 	 I went through my basic training, at first difficult and then as I progressed much easier.
0.81 	 My time was spent during the height of the troubles in NI and the cold war.
0.86 	 She spent some time out there researching.
0.96 	 She made a bee line for me and condemned me for being a British soldier.
0.88 	 My only answer was see the film 'A long day's dying'.
0.58 	 The answer is right at the end.
0.7 	 From start to finish, I laughed real hard throughout the whole movie.
0.95 	 Do yourself a favor and trash all those soft, lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket!
0.67 	 Bad to the point where it is funny.
0.63 	 How matter how much I try to convince myself, I just can't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons.
0.85 	 You don't expect a good story(or, I don't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie) but at least the story has to try to make sense.
0.8 	 The soldiers think of how to beat them(in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but can't seem to convince even just one second).
1.0 	 I'll say this to begin with:...Why, oh why, can't WB do what these short film directors do?
1.0 	 But I guess they're kinda put on edge when a man with a $12,000 budget can make a super-hero fan drool.
0.91 	 Let's face it people, Superman is no super-model.
0.89 	 And I don't know what that guy a few comments above me was on, but Superman is actually pretty beefy(Have you ever actually read a Superman comic?).
0.97 	 I Guess that fact alone just floors me...It seems like such an obvious choice to get someone with some actual muscle-mass to play a Super-hero, rather than a pretty-face.
0.99 	 I don't know what every one is talking about, O'Hearn isn't that bad.
0.68 	 I mean, come on people, this movie had a $12,000 dollar budget, what were you expecting?.
0.92 	 The Flying sequences left something to be desired, but once again, with a bigger budget...Oh, And he even used a Batmobile!
1.0 	 (It was probably a Model, but it looked damned convincing).<br /><br />All in all, this trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget.
0.96 	 And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible Director, and NEEDS to be apart of some kind a Project...But no, they'll(Like most of the Marvel projects) just keep getting these hack directors who show almost no regard for the fans and what they care about, and keep churning out these gamble movies.
1.0 	 Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage.
1.0 	 He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed.
0.9 	 By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.<br /><br />Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it.
0.55 	 But Morse was a man in a man dominated company.
0.99 	 Each ends up falling for her, and either being pushed aside when no longer useful, or destroyed by her.
0.92 	 Will she stick up for him?
0.53 	 The original ending had Stanwyck boarding a ship for Europe abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing she can't do it to him, returning to their apartment house, and finding he's shot himself.
0.61 	 She has none - at least none for powerful men (whom she hates).
0.94 	 Wood (when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him) admits that he did not want her to work.
0.71 	 <br /><br />But in 2006, Stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place.
0.9 	 Of course, if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful.
0.93 	 Cragg is remade in the "bowdlerized" version into trying to make her seek a moral center.
0.94 	 While Nieztsche did stress power sometimes, it wasn't the be-all and end-all of his theories.
0.91 	 Otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses.
0.94 	 In short if somebody who thoroughly studied Nieztsche confronted Cragg he'd make him look like a half-educated fool.
0.89 	 A good film, and for it's day worth a 10...but seriously flawed.
0.99 	 <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?)
0.55 	 If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV!
0.88 	 If I remember correctly, the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation (but not "rip-off") of 2001, because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man, who had somehow been turned into a computer.
0.82 	 And like HAL, they tried to disconnect his "mind", but not the mechanical parts of him, and as with HAL, it led to disaster.
0.52 	 There is at least one funny moment.
0.99 	 When the Christopher Cary character, who can't find any food, finds the abandoned pet bird, there's a kind of ominous moment, but then the obvious thing doesn't happen after all.
0.98 	 That, for a millennium, Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Fred's Scrooge is never even hinted at!
0.77 	 Open on Nick learning how to make toys, then on Fred learning how to run numbers; Nick giving a sick child a dolly, Fred repossessing the dolly, along with the family farm!
0.98 	 After a few more such episodes, morph to present-day Fred venting his spleen at Siblings Anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy.
0.79 	 which just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg.
1.0 	 Children who are the true embodiments of evil?
0.56 	 Bah!
0.51 	 Republic pictures comes late in the game to the "werewolf" er Werecat genre.
0.52 	 The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts.
1.0 	 He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller.
0.51 	 Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancÃ© ends up dead.
0.74 	 Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not.<br /><br />Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed.
0.97 	 The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer, he's the most interesting thing in this film.
1.0 	 And I wanted to love it.
0.99 	 Let's not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes).
0.97 	 Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort.
0.78 	 It's commerce, not art!
1.0 	 The book was powerful.
0.91 	 The views and the learning of Little Tree were powerfully portrayed in the book.
0.99 	 Still a nice tale for kids.
0.84 	 It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money.
0.85 	 was finally unearthed for a screening.
0.65 	 Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of them.
1.0 	 Then, too, the 'modern' segment is weakly written.
0.92 	 VAMPYRES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood...<br /><br />Taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, Jose Ramon Larraz' daring shocker VAMPYRES pushed the concept of Adult Horror much further than British censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original British release.
1.0 	 Daubeney') uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition.<br /><br />Shot on location at a picturesque country house during the Autumn of 1973, Harry Waxman's haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding, in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel).
0.96 	 A must-see item for cult movie fans, an amusing curio for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste.
0.53 	 Watch out for silent era superstar Bessie Love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie.
0.73 	 For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic.
0.69 	 Better formulated, better executed.
0.83 	 Why?
0.88 	 While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be?
0.58 	 Sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them.
0.69 	 !<br /><br />WAIT FOR THE DVD OR DON'T BOTHER
0.78 	 I've seen this film literally over 100 times...it's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!!
0.65 	 As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981)I never thought an actor could capture the "intensity" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones!
1.0 	 It is one of the better Indian movies I have seen lately, instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies.
0.98 	 I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see.
0.94 	 Well, I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story.
0.85 	 This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.
1.0 	 Someone(or, something thing..)is leaving puncture marks on the jugular and draining victims of their blood till dead.
0.57 	 She's impressionable and often von Niemann just humors her and constant fictional illnesses she feels plagued with.
0.98 	 The film is obviously as low-budget as they come, but this doesn't hurt the film too much since it's put together rather well by director Frank R Strayer and his crew.
0.71 	 This is the kind of B-horror item you'd find packaged in with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers.
1.0 	 Watchable little semi-soaper, but hardly captivating.
0.79 	 Still, two or three funny moments.
0.73 	 What amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable McNicol is.
0.72 	 Makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg-conscious if every guy wants to hump her.
0.67 	 Well, almost every guy; the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone.
0.99 	 And yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem; hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness.
0.63 	 Nervousness??
0.92 	 I was also surprised how quickly and eagerly McNicol makes friends with a French woman who is screwing a married guy.
0.91 	 It's not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck!
0.99 	 Kind of cutish but nothing special, quite average.<br /><br />But what the hell is Carradine doing playing some kind of a (relatively) smooth guy flirting with McNicol and her pal?!
0.93 	 This guy was in "Revenge of the Nerds"!
0.58 	 In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool's Junior Liaison Officers the opening title points out that 92% of potential delinquents, who have been dealt with under this scheme, have not committed a second crime.
0.96 	 However, this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem.<br /><br />Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of Juvenile Liaison Officer.
0.72 	 Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer.
0.55 	 Obviously in the light of the real-life Dumblaine Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying.
0.88 	 I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I wouldn't understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller's last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape.
0.65 	 The web site had many tales of "actual" stigmata throughout history.
0.73 	 However, scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed by its quest for "genuineness" that it becomes comical at first, then outright hard to watch toward the end.
0.51 	 Is Frankie possessed by Satan, or a vessel for Jesus Christ?<br /><br />The only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.
0.56 	 Spring Byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by Hamilton.
0.98 	 Sadly, it has disappeared and faded into obscurity.
1.0 	 I loved the animated series, and even Batman Beyond.
0.86 	 It's like one long TOY commercial.
0.62 	 And what the heck was with the Joker?
1.0 	 Who,in my most humble opinion, is the best Batman villain of ALL time and they KILLED him.
0.71 	 Actually, I wish I could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting.
1.0 	 "You look great!"
1.0 	 Well, i =f you enjoy B-rates this is good for you.
0.92 	 I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a Public Service Announcement.<br /><br />Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem.
0.87 	 I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn't tear your eyes away from.
0.54 	 To prove it was a multi-national cast, all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose.<br /><br />- As is typical with this type of movie (at least since Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement.
0.9 	 Before you could recover from that astounding innovation, you got to see the ship from his point of view.
0.98 	 Judging from the angle, the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.<br /><br />- Fun fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (as from a fireplace) creates light without heat.
0.96 	 Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said, "You're going to be okay, my prince."
0.98 	 The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase.<br /><br />Cain's Double Indemnity was filmed perfectly by Billy Wilder - let's ignore Stanwyck's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore!
0.98 	 The dialog is not hard-boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization.
0.86 	 We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac.
0.99 	 The drifter is a complete tramp, the wife is no Lana Turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage.
1.0 	 Her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese, rude and arrogant.
1.0 	 My only beef is with the overlong running time.
0.99 	 It can be a bit 'talky' at times but never so much as to completely sink the film.
0.75 	 No message.
0.94 	 No symbolism.
0.88 	 This movie is hilarious, not in good way.
1.0 	 Five years later memories come back, takes revenge blablabla.
0.99 	 Or "Some Came Running Out Of The Cinema".
0.94 	 Even his pretty niece wants a piece of him!
0.99 	 In real life, someone like Sinatra (without the fame) wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as MacLaine.
0.99 	 MacLaine is charming as ever, but she plays a caricature - and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film.
0.67 	 MacLaine.
0.87 	 And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married!
0.88 	 There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie & Martin vs. some clichÃ© caricatures out of the writer's "vivid" imagination.
0.5 	 I saw this movie today and I have to say, it was much much better than I expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it.
0.96 	 Personally I had some prejudice due to the language of it, but it did totally change my idea.
0.81 	 Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie.
0.91 	 He really got beaten badly, but the only thing that it caused to him, was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning, when Frits got some stitches..well I guess every movie has it own faults..have to say, that if I someday somewhere find this DVD from the store, it's sure thing, that I take it with me.
0.73 	 The entire cast, with the exception of Garbo, is different from the previous version of the film, and Garbo benefits from not having to compete with Marie Dressler, who stole every scene she was in during the English-language version.
0.53 	 Also, the screenplay adaptation for the European audience made Anna's profession quite clear from the start, and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the Brown filming.
0.99 	 Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness.
0.96 	 I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist
 really nervous laughter.
0.72 	 In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however, it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character, Scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.<br /><br />3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film.
0.98 	 I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor.
1.0 	 Gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue.
0.65 	 Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground "playing Wickerman".<br /><br />The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison.
0.97 	 In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter.
0.56 	 The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found.
0.95 	 Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter.
0.97 	 Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.<br /><br />I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry.
0.99 	 I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks.
0.8 	 I didn't agree with any of the theology in the Left Behind series, but nonetheless I found the books gripping and I read 8 of 12 of them.
0.74 	 Undeniably good writing and interesting story.
0.72 	 So it was done independently... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show.
1.0 	 Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he was supposed to be this charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero trace of an accent.
0.97 	 So I imagined somebody like Pierce Brosnan in the role.
0.66 	 So that lost a few stars for me right there.
0.99 	 so i watched this movie last night on LMN (Lifetime Movie Network) which is NOT known for showing quality movies.
0.54 	 i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it, i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it.
0.95 	 and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive, i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town: the beautiful capitol building, the UT tower lit up for a winning football game, etc.
0.63 	 also, it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin.
0.87 	 in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90+ degrees.
1.0 	 Cecil B. deMille's 1922 parlor-to-prison tearjerker Manslaughter finds the lovely Leatrice Joy as a good-at-heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with.
1.0 	 Her recklessness leads to imprisonment, which in turn leads to her regeneration.
1.0 	 The quality of deMille's direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him.
1.0 	 The only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is Lois Wilson, who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally.
0.81 	 She is convincing and endearing in tearful close-ups, as long as you don't read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak.
0.93 	 Like I said, everybody else is droningly routine, Joy, Meighan, even Julia Faye.
0.99 	 Meighan's character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of America is declining in it's moral stance, and going right back to the decadence of Rome.
0.95 	 This "film" is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film.
0.81 	 well, it's just been invented by I, Robot.
0.81 	 )<br /><br />What happened to practicality?
0.51 	 (i.e.
1.0 	 the car garage, the skin spray) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop.<br /><br />What happened to showing respect for women?
0.51 	 (i.e.
0.94 	 WHERE IS THE TENSION?
0.83 	 I'll tell you where, good looks and not admiration or common ground)<br /><br />What happened to a detective that detects?
0.98 	 Twice In One Scene?
0.93 	 so thanks Alex.
0.94 	 <br /><br />I pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler everything else in films...... but mainly simpler techniques.<br /><br />Big Budget Action films: "you so have to die"
0.84 	 Well...now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his "House of 1,000 Corpses" crapfest, I can now rest in peace.
0.92 	 When he finally finds one, he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant, Simone Choule, attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window.
0.99 	 While at first his performance seems odd and wooden, slowly one finds out that Polanski acts that way because Trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way; as a simpleton with almost no life, who traps himself in this maddening sub-world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people.
0.8 	 Also, the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has.
0.65 	 OK.
0.99 	 I'm biased.
0.7 	 His physical appearance isn't the typical miser.
0.76 	 And I don't believe there are many cynics who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption.
0.74 	 If you haven't seen this version I would strongly urge that you do.
0.69 	 It's usually available for a very small amount of money... or are you too mean?
1.0 	 The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though.
0.63 	 The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face.
0.98 	 This movie has several views of London too although none of them are good.
0.81 	 There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal.
0.99 	 The MST3K version is pretty good although not one of there bests.
0.91 	 There's a major difference between releasing an original, intense, edge-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with "Cabin Fever" and simply acted like it.
0.81 	 The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, flesh-eating disease.
0.9 	 When she got the call to audition, she said, "Who's Gene Kelly?"
0.67 	 So Freed went to studio head Louis B. Mayer himself and got him to agree, New York said no.
0.87 	 Arranging a screening for the then ailing Raoul Dufy, the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits.
0.97 	 Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clichÃ©s to it.
0.91 	 Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man.
0.57 	 Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties.
0.62 	 It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie.
0.64 	 Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi.
0.83 	 Chuck the story, the characters and the plot.
0.83 	 When a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash, his spinster twin sister, Martha Craig (Madge Kennedy), doesn't believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive (even though self-snuff runs in the family) but his three beautiful daughters couldn't care less.
0.94 	 Valerie wants Norton to seduce Lorna when he's not fending off the advances of another sister, the nymphet Vicki (Marla English), but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when Norton falls for his prey.
0.76 	 All bets are off as a world of woe -including corporate chicanery, seductions, suicides, blackmail, a murder plot, the Mann Act, double-crosses, disfigurement, and poetic justice- befall "Craig Manor", an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea...<br /><br />This preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for WRITTEN ON THE WIND, also from 1956.
1.0 	 When a student reporter (Johansson) finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter (McShane) when she enters the materializer of a lame magician (Allen).
0.92 	 As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves, we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Broken in disc form.
0.97 	 Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected.
0.92 	 Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the "original", the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior.
0.86 	 Indeed, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary, there really is little to discuss.
0.92 	 As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken's pre-production, production and post-production.
0.63 	 And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of', in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.<br /><br />Of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion.
0.78 	 Then again, there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks.
1.0 	 The one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously.
0.75 	 Of course, we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome.
0.95 	 Robert Carradine has a role as a ruthless businessman who is being wooed by his truly repellent ex-brother-in-law, Nicholas Bell, the one opening "Primal Park", a resort / zoo featuring genetically created sabretooth tigers as it's major attraction.
0.72 	 Stacy Haiduk, still quite yummy, is a security officer who attempts to convince Bell to get the investors he hopes to goad into putting money in his multi-million dollar project to leave the island.
0.94 	 Brian Wimmer is Haiduck's lover and his role is a mechanic keeping operations running smoothly.<br /><br />Bell's fate at the end, resulting from a dislodged tooth from a sabretooth tiger statue is the pits.
1.0 	 Carradine spends a great deal of the film taunting Bell, his arch nemesis.
0.99 	 The tiger's point-of-view shows humans in a bright color as it moves towards them.
0.54 	 They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story.
1.0 	 The movie doesn't feel disjointed at all.
0.98 	 Like Proust says : "Art doesn't care for all this proclamations, and only exists in silence."
0.61 	 And that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist.
0.96 	 You can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer, and that after a while, nothing happens outside.
0.82 	 At the end of the movie, when you see Alexandre writing, and Veronika asking if he's writing his life,you can guess that he's not, that even literature failed.
0.76 	 And in this tiny nurse's room, Alexandre looks more like Albertine than Marcel.<br /><br />To explain this failure, we can say that Alexandre is a Balzac's reader.
0.83 	 The highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going over some rough ground and a truck beeping it's horn.<br /><br />I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and hoped for a similar eerie role from Williams, but alas was sorely let down.
0.94 	 (The Zelda candle just didn't cut it for me)
0.9 	 I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back.
0.95 	 In the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie?
0.93 	 And his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original.
0.98 	 I would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self, with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it's big brother.
0.99 	 One of those classics, held up next to "Deep Throat" and "Behind the Green Door.
0.86 	 Worth a look if you're a Fan.
0.59 	 The film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life.
0.9 	 I believed it, or I should say, him.
0.65 	 No real sense of period.
0.99 	 Here, she's anything but kindly or batty.
0.65 	 Instead, her son, George Macready is the loony one.
0.94 	 Just don't give him a knife, otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe.
0.94 	 The script never strays from Foch's dilemma.
0.94 	 They're going to kill her, but why.
0.61 	 Her predicament makes no sense.
0.87 	 The tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another, but even strangers seem against her.
0.98 	 My one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events.
0.93 	 Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters).
0.98 	 i cant believe that they cut it off TV, and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but I'm not sure.
0.92 	 I LUVED IT SO MUCH <3 <br /><br />its about a women by the name of cybersix, she is not human.
0.92 	 She goes by adrian sieldman, a man teacher at a highschool.
0.65 	 Now cybersix is actually a women, she is just disguised as a man in the day.
0.96 	 Why did they cut it off????
0.83 	 Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast.<br /><br />I found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule!
0.96 	 Simple dialogue.
0.79 	 But Robert Downey, Jr. is so cute, I gave this "poor man's afternoon special" a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved.
0.54 	 I really sympathised with the main character of the film, because, this is true, I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).
1.0 	 Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid (because of wasting vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old.
0.95 	 Most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition, and pealing off his bandages.
0.6 	 Jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour, he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin.
0.82 	 Note, for example, that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in Vermont, where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees.
0.63 	 Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which wouldn't last five minutes in the New England climate.
0.78 	 As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay.
0.86 	 Were it not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all.
0.75 	 Firstly, the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time: of MY time.
0.91 	 Charley Partanna (Nicholson) is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest more than an international hit-man.
0.99 	 ; Do I love her?
1.0 	 What is love?
0.99 	 The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding (alÃ¡ The Godfather) and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film.
0.98 	 But what we get is something very, very different.<br /><br />The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with Â maybe the film will kick-start.
0.84 	 It's a film where cameras reflect in windows; lights reflect in sides of cars and 'dead' chauffeurs blink when nudged.
0.93 	 I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film.
0.64 	 This happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television.
0.99 	 The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written.
0.97 	 The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are nothing alike content wise.
0.86 	 I still have that aging tape, which I try to watch annually.
0.98 	 Too Bad It A New Pokemon Didn't Talk This Time.
0.83 	 <br /><br />Truly, I have watched this movie many times.
0.99 	 It always makes me feel good!!
0.62 	 It's not that it 'tries too hard' to be cool or that 'It's so close' to hitting the mark for an action film....It's frantic.
0.99 	 It's the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene.
0.94 	 I never felt safer in my life.
0.94 	 Warm and happy too.
0.85 	 I was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase, due to less production in the summer months...anywho <br /><br />The direction was 'uninspired' the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed, or re-choreographed and tightened up, the sound was off the delivery didn't hit you, it just kept on going, the other way.
0.79 	 Like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile, a smiling deer.
1.0 	 <br /><br />I feel bad because 'Columbu' I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own countrymen.
0.99 	 My now x-wife hates it, but I love it!
0.74 	 <br /><br />The funny thing is, I am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even 'love'.
0.66 	 So there it is.
1.0 	 <br /><br />As a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch, straight to video-B movies or 'bad' movies for your little library collection then, if you can find it, check out 'The Big Sweat' (1991) with Robert Z' Dar..you know the big guy from 'TANGO & CASH'.
0.98 	 -Good fun.
0.68 	 <br /><br />But all in all, not as good as Baretta's Island', I gave it a '1' and an overall rating of 'awful' for awful-good B' movie.
0.7 	 Right?
0.61 	 (*)
0.98 	 I can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in SF said this was a good movie, and wonder WHO posted the glowing review here on IMDb.
0.9 	 Very disappointed in this movie, and mad I actually went to a theatre to see it, based on the faulty connection to Garden State, which is a far funnier, more inventive, and touching movie than this one.
0.81 	 I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by-the-numbers that I nearly left, and some in the audience actually DID.
1.0 	 I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she declines, and then he is seen WALKING HOME.
0.86 	 Where's his car??
0.85 	 Cats jumping on people.
0.57 	 Wait, I take that back!
0.97 	 See it for writer Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard.
0.76 	 He's actually pretty good.
1.0 	 Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film.
0.88 	 Audience, please stay away.
0.78 	 I must admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I am a big fan of Gackt and a *huge* fan of Hyde.
0.95 	 I mean, the synopsis sounded really out there.
0.91 	 The element of vampirism - which I love, but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story.
0.87 	 I ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first...and then I went back and tried to think of why I wasn't giving it that last point.
0.94 	 Came up with nothing.
0.55 	 So a ten out of ten it is.
0.98 	 After all - I'm not much of a critic - the fact that I'm bothering to write a review at all means I either really hate the movie or really love it.
0.61 	 The realism of the movie and it's performance by Bret Carr is not to be missed.
1.0 	 What a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.
1.0 	 But, let's face it, their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents.
0.79 	 The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and Â even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event.
1.0 	 The absolute last thing Lordi's first (and hopefully last) horror film brings is change and ingenuity.
1.0 	 The immense budget ("Dark Floors" supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art, but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling?
1.0 	 With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations, I personally always presumed Finland Â The Land of a Thousand Lakes Â would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales, but I guess that's another disillusion on my account.
0.84 	 I disagree with previous comment about this movie.
0.97 	 You don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool.
0.98 	 He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance.
0.63 	 She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious results...<br /><br />One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a Vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in Mexico City, she's fine, although her body temperature is below room temperature...<br /><br />Guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires, hero leaves the next day.
0.69 	 This remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.<br /><br />DeNiro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however he needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.<br /><br />Gregory Peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this.<br /><br />Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo's Oil but is not on the same form as "Weeds".
1.0 	 Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.<br /><br />Some good points?
0.72 	 The start credits(!
0.87 	 O my gosh... Just give me a minute to breath.
0.95 	 so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump (or fidget nervously.
0.78 	 )<br /><br />i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it... maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid.
0.98 	 Several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why.
0.99 	 This movie wasn't full of squeaky clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.
0.99 	 Man I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited.
1.0 	 Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.
0.96 	 I have seen it, it is like one of those after school specials.
0.87 	 The acting is OK, not great.
0.98 	 Many times I think thats what makes their characters unbelievable.
0.55 	 My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would.
0.76 	 I like Luke Wilson too, and Rainn Wilson was a straight hoot.
0.88 	 When you strip away the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad.
0.75 	 It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing.
0.63 	 Hence, it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said.<br /><br />Cleopatra being an historic icon, the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer, Leonor Varela just plays fine.
1.0 	 She is strong-willed but also a very supportive, tender soul mate.
1.0 	 Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode.
1.0 	 So, it is not really a documentary, nor a peplum but a great love story.<br /><br />After the parricide, a new lover comes (Marc-Antoine) but the flavor is gone: we remember always our first love.
0.98 	 So, i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told powerfully.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the production is luxurious: the sets are big, tastefully decorated; the Moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid.
0.93 	 It was a good story, but not very well told.
0.9 	 I liked the themes and the main story line, which wasn't as clear as it could have been.
0.51 	 I only just finished watching it and I'm glad I did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end.
0.61 	 The movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what ought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses.
1.0 	 As I watched it, I was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age.
0.82 	 Nice try.
0.87 	 Yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence, but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media?
0.77 	 or video games?
0.69 	 haha I somehow dont think so.<br /><br />The movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families, its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates.
0.66 	 Charlton Heston,(Sam Burgade),"Midway",'76, had past experiences with James Coburn,(Zach Provo),"Deadfall",'93, and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back.
0.92 	 The other would have to be "Chalte Chalte."
0.92 	 In each of the the songs that are picturised, she looks young but after that she does not.
0.96 	 Those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears.
0.99 	 I gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors.
0.97 	 The acting was better than average, but the plot held no surprises.
0.92 	 Now as to the historical errors, if you call them that, the first Capitan to pilot the Enterprise was Commander April, then Capt.
0.73 	 I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets old.
0.94 	 The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches.
0.76 	 It is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base..
0.67 	 I totally suggest bying the DVDs, i've already preordered them... i suggest you do to...
0.97 	 The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending, something which was basically mandatory by the 80s.
0.95 	 Second movie in the boxset.
0.92 	 <br /><br />The movie takes place in the year 2210.
0.61 	 Vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world.
0.94 	 The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.)
0.95 	 He has no plans of living peacefully with humans, as he is bent on world domination.
0.75 	 They both decide to kill Giuseppe, forging a car accident.
0.63 	 When I was flicking through the TV Guide, and came across "Twisted Desire" on the movie section, I read it's description.
0.98 	 Three words caught my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ...I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" absolutely vile, I hate those kind of programs, so I was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old, love story starring her...Little did I know.<br /><br />It finally started on the television, I had my bucket ready in case I were to puke over it's cheesiness or soppiness, you know what I mean.
0.96 	 You just don't expect this sort of role for that sort of actress.
0.92 	 And what was to happen happens and a few people, including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal.
0.74 	 The mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation; But the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case.
0.99 	 The political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions.
0.99 	 We are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city.
0.99 	 The mayor is perfect due to the embodiment Al Pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless.
0.99 	 I find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor campaigning in his own name.
0.93 	 It was free to watch on the Horror channel prior to its going over to subscription.
0.88 	 Two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago.
1.0 	 No camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold, and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it.
0.97 	 3 animal families, polar bear, elephant and whale, appear in more than one of these parts.
0.79 	 Each "chapter" starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is.
0.9 	 When the film opened I already knew it would end far too soon for me.
0.55 	 It is a family film, so no brutal killings of any animals.
0.83 	 No blood is shed.
0.72 	 As I knew the TV-series I was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie.
0.75 	 I will confess, however, that certain passages of dialogue, taken on their own terms, do have a lulling, haunting quality.
0.98 	 Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible.
0.92 	 DON'T SEE THIS FILM.
1.0 	 It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
0.82 	 She is engaged to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love.
0.57 	 Ronny (Nicholas Cage) hasn't forgiven Johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand (and subsequently, his then-bride-to-be), but he does fall for Loretta, and hard.
0.97 	 It has a well-written script.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Flawed but honest with a terrible honesty.
0.95 	 Mr. Scott and pretty blonde wife Sue Lyon (as Sylvia Boran) investigate the mysterious signals from outer space.
0.97 	 <br /><br />*** End of the World (1977) John Hayes ~ Kirk Scott, Sue Lyon, Christopher Lee
0.57 	 Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German-TV adaptaion of his classic play.
0.74 	 I wish this movie never was in the first place.
0.6 	 Story is about nit-picky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheating on him with a scuba instructor (Hank Azaria) after only one day on their honeymoon.
0.9 	 Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and run into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) whom they went to school with years earlier.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT***** Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start to date and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods.
0.96 	 It's very easy to say something is not funny but I think with this film it's even easier to figure out why.
0.99 	 If you do, your easy!
0.6 	 It's very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid!
0.88 	 Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions.
0.57 	 Whatever you do, don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this.
1.0 	 <br /><br />When I visited Russia as a student for a semester, my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building, just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman, because the elevators weren't working.
0.9 	 It's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film, and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources.
0.83 	 <br /><br />Though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic, overly confined to interactions between Kiki and Alexandra, it was still engaging and moving to watch, so I'll give it a 7.
0.87 	 I think a large part of it is because they way over played the "gadgets."
0.98 	 I remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time, I found that the special effects are quite good.
0.97 	 The plot is just "the Neverending Story" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye-candy.
1.0 	 The animation is amazing, and I especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm.
0.99 	 Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days, a sad insight into his movie career's decline.
0.75 	 Seagal has to get the plane back.
1.0 	 This is the final film of his Castel Studio's, multi-picture deal.
0.98 	 It's nice and violent, and on occasion we're treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings, but overall nothing special.
0.7 	 This will please many fans, but they should bear in mind, Seagal himself would probably want to forget this one's existence.
0.99 	 I thought that maybe, if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie.
0.62 	 Give it a shot.
0.56 	 I'd say not at all... just that maybe her Creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness (one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake) look not only creepy, but flat-out sick to the bone.
0.68 	 And me, for taking a chance on this.
1.0 	 Hells yeah!<br /><br />I'm not going to bore you with a plot summary, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, 'cause you all know what's up.
0.97 	 That's why you're here anyway.
0.87 	 No.
0.97 	 What I saw in that movie stuck with me big time.
0.98 	 I haven't seen it since, but I remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie.
0.79 	 For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?)
0.99 	 gets electrocuted.
0.99 	 Or, the guy being drowned in a cess pool.
0.56 	 How can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it?
0.64 	 What!?
0.51 	 Classic crap all the way.
0.98 	 But when I was 7, I was scared sh!tless.
0.96 	 That jester hat (or was it a mask?)
1.0 	 that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f*ck out!<br /><br />All in all, yes, a crappy movie.
0.63 	 Either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same Late Late Late Movie show, or hunt down a VHS copy and dust off your VCR.
0.92 	 That's my impression of this film, anyway.
0.92 	 Its supposed "jokes" and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments.
0.76 	 There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too.
1.0 	 I don't mean to bash them here, so will not.<br /><br />But do be warned that if you are like me, and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film.
0.79 	 Hmmm.
0.72 	 Maybe.
0.97 	 The film's story stopped being annoying, and became kind of a triumph of the "little guy" in the final third.
0.93 	 I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late, and missed the beginning.
0.98 	 The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders.
0.58 	 The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan.
1.0 	 But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can't be that generous.
0.72 	 I'm compelled to ask, "what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place!?"
0.98 	 And they wonder why no-one watches indie films!
0.6 	 Do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie?
0.87 	 In this movie, you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor.
0.99 	 A black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right, thus.
1.0 	 making the white professor look stupid.
0.99 	 Pay no attention to the racist.
0.54 	 I recommended everyone to go see this movie.
0.85 	 In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this.
0.98 	 However, the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa.
0.69 	 Anyhow, in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column (page 3 of the newspaper) reporter Konkana Sen Sharma.
0.97 	 The movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level.
0.99 	 The rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part, the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios, exploitation of power, hunger for media exposure.
0.86 	 Into all this is layered in homosexuality, a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot, rampant drug use, pedophilia, police "encounter" deaths.
0.87 	 This is what saves the film for me.
0.99 	 Mr. Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash.
0.55 	 He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful.
0.99 	 I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients.
0.59 	 The film is a brave (albeit flawed) effort, certainly worth a watch.
0.99 	 My comment is for the Russian version of Space Race named Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) shown on Russia's First Channel on April 10-13, 2006.
0.66 	 Apollo 1 is to be launched to the Moon, etc.
0.92 	 Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (I think this was added specially for Russian version).
0.52 	 While it was certainly one of the better movies I've seen in some time, it suffers like many sequels with its ending, as it appears that Hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging.
0.84 	 I'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim'?)
0.51 	 in 2017.
0.89 	 I saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970's.
0.77 	 I was of the tender age of 6, my brother 4, then again when I was 8 my brother 6.
0.98 	 This movie terrified my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust.
0.91 	 It wasn't just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many "christians" about the "mark of the beast"and the rapture.
0.58 	 This movie, the church, and a volatile neglectful upbringing, lead to severe paranoia towards the future.
0.52 	 I am now 40 years old.
0.86 	 Went through years of counseling.
0.63 	 I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family.
0.61 	 I actually began to believe this, it was my brother who reminded me, that this cultic philosophy actually happened.
0.94 	 I have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose, I am nearing my licensure as a Psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
0.97 	 By the time the filmmakers find them, the mansion is falling apart, and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share a squalid room.
0.7 	 The women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there.<br /><br />At times this movie can seem exploitative, as neither woman seems in the best of mental health, but at other times, the movie is hard to look away from.
0.53 	 "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current state, and her mother fires back that Edie was never going to be the success she thought she was.
0.76 	 From what we see of the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls are cracking and falling apart, and "Little" Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on.
1.0 	 While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life, the squalor they live in is utterly awful.
0.91 	 She gets taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again.
0.99 	 First, I should mention that I really enjoyed ISHII Katsuhito's previous film "Samehada Otoko to Momojiri Onna" ("Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl").
0.99 	 The scenes between ASANO Tadanobu and GASHUIN Tatsuya were particularly engaging.
0.83 	 There was action, intrigue, bizarre characterizations, enough sex to keep things interesting, and an utterly unpredictable story line.<br /><br />So it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that I began to watch "Party 7".
1.0 	 And my enthusiasm was certainly piqued with the opening credits, which left my wife and I actually stunned by how dynamic and exciting they were; the mix of anime and live-action work was brilliant!
0.97 	 One is a futuristic voyeur's paradise (borrowed a bit from "Shark Skin Man..."), another is a travel agent's office, and the third (and far the most used) is a seedy hotel room.
1.0 	 One of my all-time favorites is "My Dinner with Andre", the talkiest of all talking films.
1.0 	 "My Dinner with Andre" is far more exciting, and it just has two middle-aged men discussing their lives over dinner.
0.99 	 The key is that Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn tell interesting stories.
0.9 	 But Tarentino's conversations always have their own internal logic and wit ("They call it a 'Royale, with cheese'").
1.0 	 If it weren't for the brief, hilarious cameo from Gashuin (who is always marvelous) and a low-key performance from the awesome ASANO Tadanobu, I would've given "Party 7" a single star.
0.51 	 Notle plays Howard W. Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II.
0.56 	 (7 out of 10)
0.85 	 It completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways.
0.89 	 I went to see this movie with my 17 y.o.
0.76 	 daughter.
1.0 	 In the NASCAR spirit, this is a sponser's dream.
0.94 	 Earlier Herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest.
0.69 	 Ms. Lohan, Disney's reigning drama queen, has little acting ability.
0.68 	 I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project.
0.57 	 She makes a pass at Vivian, who seems startled and says to her, "Oh...I'm...not that way."
0.98 	 Everything seems okay...until the plan gets set in motion<br /><br />First, Abby shows up at Gabe's office, naked, asking Gabe if she should get a boob job.
0.59 	 "What do you want to know?"
0.92 	 "There's trouble.....let me guess.
0.71 	 "Yes."
1.0 	 "She's not a bad girl?"
0.87 	 "No."
0.7 	 "Does that door have a lock on it?
0.59 	 "<br /><br />You know what happens next....Abby gets it on with Gabe, right there in the exam room.
1.0 	 After that, she puts on a little show in her window for James, who comes over and wastes no time in having sex with her.
0.95 	 What James doesn't know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera taping all the festivities (it's so obvious anyway).
0.78 	 Now that Abby has something on both men, she requests $100,000 from each in order to buy her silence.
0.81 	 That was a long time ago, but you wouldn't know that seeing her in action with Abby--she looked like an old pro.<br /><br />While Gigi goes along with the plan, she's seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having.
0.73 	 Gabe and James use this info to fight back against Abby's blackmail.<br /><br />Now, on to the sex.
0.54 	 The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering all the women involved in this film except for Julia Kruis have a lengthy porn background, I wouldn't have expected anything less.
0.79 	 Monique Alexander only got naked once, but she was a relatively minor character.
0.9 	 At least she can do drama somewhat.
0.98 	 Chelsea Blue was a scene stealer--she wasn't that bad as the antagonist.
0.87 	 The two girl-girl offerings weren't scorching, but they did warm up the screen.
0.85 	 That goes for Nicole Sheridan, too--even though she's probably better at doing comedy.
0.99 	 And although it's a period piece, the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale.
1.0 	 Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre.
0.96 	 About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life.
1.0 	 Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at.
0.94 	 Of course the girls in that one are very cute.
0.87 	 The story is something about a bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant, but beyond that, I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing.
0.9 	 ), but all is not as it seems...The censors must have LOVED Harlow's line "A girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged."
0.96 	 At one point, Paige declares "You oughta scratch me off your list - I'm not a ladies man"....
0.87 	 I wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the Hayes code came rolling into town.
0.7 	 What was he really saying?
0.81 	 Wackiness ensues.
0.88 	 The sorceress, is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself.
0.95 	 She sends various minions, each weirder than the last, after our heroes who win through in the end, striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere.
0.56 	 For some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion, Six Million Dollar Man style, toward our heroes when they attack.
0.99 	 Sure, he's a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil.
0.63 	 Needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero, Mace.
1.0 	 When he meets Ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type, claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies, traipsing the misty hills together.
0.98 	 Mace promises to take Ilias with him in return for bow related favours.
0.83 	 Ilias asks where he is going.
0.55 	 "Wherever my legs take me," is his reply.
0.92 	 Good enough for Ilias.
1.0 	 He proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals, citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The films villainess is quite unusual.
0.99 	 Hardly the world's most scary villain and not really a step forward for women's rights.
0.64 	 I think he sic's the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates Mace in a situation where there is no no-one else around but Mace to fool.
1.0 	 Was he really worthy trading your self respect for, Ocron?
0.87 	 moments.
0.62 	 Ilias wusses out, I forget why, possibly his permed hairdo got mussed, but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid Mace in fighting the forces of evil.
0.69 	 The bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary.
0.94 	 He then is able to shoot Ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity.
0.99 	 Mace smiles.
0.76 	 I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film.
1.0 	 I loved her character.
0.67 	 Besides, she's cute.
0.81 	 She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point.
0.99 	 She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick.
0.99 	 I think she made her argument very well.
0.66 	 Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified of what she is about to face.
0.98 	 I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear.
0.94 	 Furthermore, I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in.<br /><br />As for the movie in general, other than Megan, it was pretty much what I expected.
0.98 	 It had excellent gore scenes, by micro-budget standards.
0.65 	 I love the sadism of the doctor.
0.59 	 For slasher film lovers, he was probably the best character.<br /><br />I give this film 4 out of 10.
0.73 	 I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro-budget horror.
0.8 	 I disliked this movie for numerous reasons.
0.94 	 The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman.
0.6 	 Afterward, I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were "moments" in each of their performances.
0.56 	 As one reviewer has noted and I would agree, the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form.
0.84 	 I suspect that, or at least hope that (for the actor's sakes anyway) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor.
0.63 	 Sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop.
0.74 	 Oh yeah and another thing...I wished for just once I could go see an American movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and/or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans, smashed CDs and, other such trash!
0.97 	 It's definitely one of the weirdest movies I've seen in a long time.
0.86 	 It is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places.
0.69 	 The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite unsettling.<br /><br />The humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone.
0.95 	 In the hands of another director, it might be a very heavy story.
0.79 	 This movie is surely not for the main stream audience - but for fans of Italian (or Portuguese) cinema, a must-see also for Mastroianni-fans.
0.89 	 Domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars.
1.0 	 The editing didn't bother me.
0.94 	 Must say that no matter how many times I've seen this movie I can't help but tear up.
0.91 	 That lady's a fox!
0.9 	 This was a watershed event in my movie watching life.
0.56 	 I went to see this in the theater when it came out.
0.93 	 Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor.
1.0 	 Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "Conquest".
0.78 	 We watched it in English and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters.
0.51 	 Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well.
0.53 	 The only thing I didn't like was Suicune's appearance, he just suddenly pops up, helps Ash & co a bit and leaves.
0.93 	 Lord Alan Cunningham(Antonio De TeffÃ¨)is a nutjob{seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum}, with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin, likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife Evelyn, a woman who betrayed him for another man, with those red locks.
0.97 	 This nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring.
0.94 	 While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence, Alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with Gladys(Marina Malfatti, who spends most of the film naked..that's probably her lone attribute since she isn't a very good actress), who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away{there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth}.<br /><br />The only real person Alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital, Dr. Richard Timberlane(Giacomo Rossi-Stuart).
0.76 	 There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan.
0.97 	 Alan's cousin, George(Rod Murdock), seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims..I mean dates, while holding onto hope of getting his lord's estate some day.
0.81 	 Aunt Agatha(Joan C Davis), wheelchair bound, lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors.
1.0 	 We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert.<br /><br />All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan, someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan, and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing.<br /><br />The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married, where is Evelyn's body, and will Alan go over the edge?
0.99 	 You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity.
0.92 	 He can be quite volatile.
0.99 	 Who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off, there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it.
0.51 	 What happens to Alan doesn't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he's just getting what he deserves.
0.95 	 Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan, as I pointed out before, aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances(..or advantages they'd have)that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan's sanity, then everything just comes off less than stellar.
0.92 	 Some stylistics help and there is a sniff of Gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some.
0.95 	 Said cloak has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here.
1.0 	 Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without.
0.64 	 The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled.
1.0 	 Well, some people would say that this particular movie stinks...but hey!
0.58 	 Oh my.
0.72 	 There is not even a hint of a decent story, multi-layered characters, or attraction.
0.53 	 But then again, it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age, that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all.<br /><br />Take my advice and stay far, far away from this movie.
0.67 	 Your little daughter can make a better storyline, and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty, her tales are much more worth listening to.
0.76 	 sets.
0.99 	 The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track.
0.73 	 There are echoes (sorry) of the band players of "Brassed Off" the models of "Calendar Girls" and the dancers of "the Full Monty".
0.99 	 He faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing except death is going to stop him.<br /><br />Despite the somewhat corny story, we get to know and like many of the characters, who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable "types'.
1.0 	 Do something notable with you lives people.
0.63 	 (I rented it in Argentina).
0.96 	 That is no criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past.
0.92 	 Similar to Winter Soldier because of it's one-sided message, both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering.
0.55 	 Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines, but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for.
0.92 	 <br /><br />My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda.
0.66 	 Not by me, mind you, but by those aiming to discredit the film and message.
0.99 	 Here the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by an unbelievably young Dean Jagger), gains control of a method to create zombies, though in fact, his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves.
0.97 	 This is an interesting concept for a movie, and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of 'Dr.
0.96 	 Mabuse' films, including 'Dr.
1.0 	 Mabuse the Gambler' (1922) and 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse' (1933).
0.95 	 At some type of compound (where we get great 30s sets and clothes) he announces his engagement to Claire, and then barely five minutes later, she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal, Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland).
0.98 	 We won't see such sheer force of will until John Agar in 'The Brain From Planet Arous' (1957).<br /><br />Finally Claire consents to marry him if he will let Greyson live and return to America.
0.54 	 Louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves.
1.0 	 On their wedding night he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his 'powers.'
0.95 	 To gain her love, he does so, causing the 'revolt' of the title, in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him.
0.76 	 On repeated viewings (?)
0.98 	 one can see the artistry in the well formed script!
0.93 	 We remember him more for his bald, old man roles in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'X The Unknown' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958).
0.99 	 The story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the Halperin brothers better, earlier film 'White Zombie' (1932) in which hapless Robert Frazier (as Charles Beaumont) uses 'zombification' to win the love of Madge Bellamy (as Madeline Parker).<br /><br />If you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!)
1.0 	 In the modern era of classy films, there are 'Horror Express' (1972), 'The Serpent and the Rainbow' (1988), '28 Days Later' (2002) and its sequel, as well as many, many, others too numerous to mention.<br /><br />This one is not really a zombie film.
0.95 	 Judging this movie on its own terms, it's more of a semi-Gothic romance.
0.57 	 As such it ranks a little below some of Universal's bottom billed B horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s.
0.77 	 Apparently based on true events, though?
0.62 	 This time around a generally hated financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor.
1.0 	 At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Shaun of the Dead'.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop.
0.96 	 The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but with Ollie receiving the bulk (!)
1.0 	 of the punishment-- see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'Towed in a Hole' (1932) as some some classic examples.<br /><br />Here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan's father?)
0.82 	 the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations.
0.69 	 or comic abilities.<br /><br />The film begins with them running from the police.
0.53 	 The premise for the 'humor', Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging.
0.51 	 Okay you're a cab!"
0.54 	 In fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years.<br /><br />Since this film does not play to any of their strengths, why bother with it?
0.77 	 However, the Mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous, vainglorious popinjay--gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since.
0.99 	 In a coonskin cap and carrying Ol' Betsy, he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie.
0.64 	 With no conviction in the portrayal, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions.
0.96 	 <br /><br />The script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions.
0.97 	 The Mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the Napoleonic Wars a generation earlier.
0.9 	 The whole project of defending the former Spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill- advised--a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "The Alamo".
0.9 	 Not only that but the prejudices displayed in the TV series are not nearly as wide spread in the books.
0.79 	 Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all.
0.52 	 The story was very believable and I totally lost it and cried toward the end.
0.93 	 Parts of the movie are sad though (such as when Sassy, the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when Shadow falls in the hole at the end.)
0.94 	 Ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects.
0.84 	 Jason London is funny as Luke, the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal Dracula's body from the slab.
0.87 	 Diane Neal Is good as the woman who steals Dracula's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend, And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself.
0.99 	 Roy Scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie, and he does a decent job as the mentor of Jason Scott Lee's character.
0.95 	 This is the second sequel in the trilogy, and they are off to a good start.
0.92 	 It's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note.
1.0 	 It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.
0.71 	 The year was 1972, and I.T.V.
0.58 	 It commenced with a cool action sequence as Solo and Kuryakin's sports car got attacked by a squadron of THRUSH mini-copters.
0.97 	 It hurts by being a television product, albeit even one more slightly expensive than usual.
0.96 	 No location filming was done, and the various segments come across as repetitive, usually culminating in a scrap between U.N.C.L.E.
0.96 	 Of the cast, Joan Crawford is memorably hammy in her small role, and Curt Jurgens badly miscast as a sugar daddy.
0.77 	 Kim Darby grates though as 'Sandy'.
0.97 	 Cosmatos tries too hard to make this movie a masterpiece and that makes this movie a typical "art"-movie.
0.99 	 I imagine that the young people involved in the making of "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play ("The Cradle Will Rock"); scared people into thinking that aliens were invading ("The War of the Worlds"); and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time ("Citizen Kane").
0.99 	 Fortunately, over the final thirteen years of his life, he narrated the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and hosted the documentary "The Man who Saw Tomorrow" (about Nostradamus).
0.69 	 What on earth has become of our dear Ramu?
1.0 	 If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times.
1.0 	 I believe Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work.
0.92 	 He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier.
1.0 	 Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have many dialogs (in fact none if I remember clearly).
0.65 	 The new guy playing Jai's role seems to have that brash look, but didn't manage Jai's role at all.
0.68 	 This one-minute film is arguably the first movie ever made.
0.63 	 Premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop.
0.99 	 It was well done in THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.<br /><br />Now herein lies the dilemma.
0.99 	 i watched the trailer so many times that i didn't know what to expect but got totally sucked in.
0.93 	 i recommend it to anyone who's a ryan donowho fan, and dominique swain was good in it too.
0.98 	 Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes fake promises in order to get the money.
0.6 	 Not to mention that it's just so cute and touching.
0.86 	 I know it's ridicules and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls.
0.93 	 How could they not?
0.98 	 Its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off - again, not unlike the grim inevitability of death!<br /><br />Returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels', the main character, Tom, is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life.
0.92 	 If there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic', then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of Schwimmer's other - more famous - role.
1.0 	 To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE 'clueless' than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as Schwimmer, but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place.<br /><br />How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable', even if the situations aren't?
0.86 	 A man with a longstanding high-school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years.
0.96 	 Sound familiar... ?
0.51 	 2/10.
0.76 	 What a good movie!
0.83 	 Why?
0.51 	 OOOOOO .....
0.51 	 ?
0.67 	 We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie and now this.
0.98 	 What's the similarities?
0.99 	 It's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor.
0.99 	 The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films.
1.0 	 They were quirky English films with a unique charm/atmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the USA.
0.92 	 <br /><br />Wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road.
0.84 	 Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films; it defies genre, intelligent scripts, A-grade actors, the music score, set-pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film.<br /><br />So here comes a remake.
0.78 	 Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern USA - communications, paganism, virgins.
0.86 	 When he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it.
0.99 	 <br /><br />That ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two.
1.0 	 One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day.
1.0 	 The other ends with a post-production explain-it-all-to-the-thickies type conclusion.<br /><br />I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film.
0.66 	 Pat Verducci also has the writing credit.
0.81 	 I don't know of any other film work PV has done.
0.85 	 I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.<br /><br />Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown supporting cast, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly that.
0.88 	 I became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other I have ever watched.
0.86 	 I just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into Broadway...
1.0 	 Coming off the success of her first romantic comedy, Ernst Lubitsch's masterful "Ninotchka" (1939), where she was ideally cast as an austere Russian envoy, Garbo is reunited with her leading man Melvyn Douglas for a sitcom-level story that has her playing Karin Borg, a plain-Jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive Larry Blake when he becomes smitten with her.
0.66 	 Only someone with Carole Lombard's natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by-the-numbers script by S.N.
0.93 	 Behrman, Salka Viertel and George Oppenheimer.
0.54 	 MGM's intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and Americanize Garbo's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties.<br /><br />However, Garbo appears ill-at-ease mostly as the bogus party girl Katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like Douglas and Constance Bennett as romantic rival Griselda.
1.0 	 Roland Young and Ruth Gordon (in a rare appearance at this point of her career) show up in comic supporting roles as Douglas' associates.
0.91 	 It's the same old story (if you've lived through the 80s).
0.99 	 Vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the States.
1.0 	 A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite!<br /><br />Time goes on, the soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble.
0.68 	 You can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The one thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning, and about how they're really good at what they do when they plan ahead.
0.98 	 Then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs, they do it again.
0.51 	 Phh!!!!
0.92 	 Foolishness!<br /><br />There is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure it's real.
0.62 	 EVERY single one of them.
0.52 	 But someday maybe it'll all come right and they'll make a sequel.
0.51 	 !
0.87 	 I did not know anyone actually named their offspring that) cope with the loss.
0.89 	 The editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that.
0.97 	 While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so, the tone is not an unpleasant one.
1.0 	 One of Frances Farmer's earliest movies; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful.
1.0 	 Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best.
0.99 	 Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in its time, is really corny today.
0.77 	 Roy Rogers also appears- in a singing role.
0.99 	 Well, I just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than "Little Britain" and I like it!
0.98 	 "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy that is about the most awful, insane and disgusting small town in all the UK.
0.57 	 But the show differs because although it is crude like "Little Britain" (hence not a show for kids), the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows.
0.65 	 However, you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max.
0.94 	 Both director/writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and resort to melodrama.
0.92 	 I hated this show when I was a kid.
0.83 	 Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute.
0.61 	 At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own.
0.56 	 McDonalds sued and won.
0.59 	 Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
0.8 	 Santa Claus???
0.99 	 Movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit, most notably 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians', at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it, and all the stock footage being used... for some reason, that seemed happy to me.
0.58 	 But this movie just screws Christmas in the butt, and screws the joy of all the kids.
0.98 	 Santa lives in space?
0.76 	 His enemy is a devil named Pitch?
1.0 	 Santa gets help from Merlin the Magician?
0.52 	 Well, since it was made in Mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made.
1.0 	 Good conquers evil, and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world, or possibly universe, thanks to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.. apparently.
0.96 	 My friend told me that this movie was a "chick flick."
0.99 	 Boy, was he wrong!
0.91 	 I guess she's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera, but just be herself.
0.94 	 While in the other half, she totally set herself back in her daily track, and I just couldn't tell her to be an editor any way.
0.7 	 Therefore, her performance is not enduring in this film.
0.99 	 I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because that is rather unclear for the two persons.
0.6 	 Plot Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped & replaced with an android double, Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber Tracker".
0.54 	 This sequel is the same as before, with an all-out action sequence opening the film.
1.0 	 There are plenty of explosions, heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount, as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson.
0.99 	 He really needs a personality transplant.
1.0 	 So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole.
0.98 	 She has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film.
0.72 	 Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character.
0.99 	 Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place.
1.0 	 Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story.
1.0 	 They made it look like WWII footage, with just a touch of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to watch.
0.53 	 Or build empires.
0.98 	 The language of fantasy.<br /><br />Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall.
0.84 	 Victoria doesn't take him very seriously.
0.9 	 To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine.
1.0 	 A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well.
0.75 	 Production values rival Hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.<br /><br />That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults.
0.98 	 Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences.
0.98 	 The actors look like they had a ball.
0.88 	 Maybe you will too.
0.76 	 The main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film, even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in-between.
0.75 	 The "Morpheus" character dies, the ONLY good thing about the movie.
0.52 	 What is this?
0.61 	 Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
0.87 	 Dear dear dear dear dear...me!
0.97 	 I had the strength to see it through...
0.93 	 !<br /><br />The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good.
0.87 	 This was some kind of Tremors for kids.
0.8 	 I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced.
0.89 	 Still makes me grin when I think about it.
0.99 	 But that only happened one more time sadly..and that's when the "badass" gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment "They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT!"
0.63 	 But after that..nothing could ever top that..(?
0.87 	 If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he's either a "plant", vegetable or someone very evil.
0.74 	 Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...*goosebumps* no..I'll leave it at that.
1.0 	 I have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it.
0.81 	 I have heard lots of positive remarks about this, so I had high hopes.
1.0 	 Particularly, I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this.
0.52 	 There was not much dialogue, It was rushed and far too fast-moving, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down.
0.69 	 I thought this could have been really good, but it was so different to the book!
0.99 	 Unless you're one of those people that likes mind-numbing films like this, and call it great art afterwards, skip it!
0.81 	 The film contains one hilarious scene after another (a similar, Italian, film popped into my mind, the terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)).
0.83 	 long, and at the end the director opens his can of sentimentality.
0.99 	 Strange world we live in...3/10
0.86 	 This is how i felt while watching this film.
0.53 	 But i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point.
0.81 	 A friend put it this way:<br /><br />"I feel like we broke into somebody's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge".<br /><br />Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film.
0.96 	 With high hopes of fame and significance he invites Harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has organised in his home town - headlined by his own drag act "Olivia Newton-Don".
0.86 	 Some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town America.
0.94 	 I have not seen anything else like it.<br /><br />Jacob.
0.78 	 He's a lawyer for Christ's sake.
0.91 	 If this is all the Watchowski's have to offer in terms of a back story to the Matrix, than I really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level.
0.57 	 The machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters.
1.0 	 They fight back, win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans, who reject them in favor of all-out war, which the cleverer machines naturally win.
0.99 	 The humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate.
0.99 	 In a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more.
0.99 	 It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate.
0.82 	 It wants to be deep and human.
0.67 	 It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie.
0.97 	 The dialog is smart -- at times.
0.95 	 Her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her.
0.77 	 Combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.<br /><br />(I kept picturing someone else in this role -- Kate Hudson for example.)
0.97 	 This is the first of "The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare" BBC series I've seen, and if all of them are like this, I might watch no more.
0.81 	 Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and artistic aspects.
0.99 	 Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written.
0.61 	 Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings.
0.95 	 As for Paris, I kept thinking of "Prince Valium" from Spaceballs.
0.53 	 Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.<br /><br />At 168 minutes, this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters, because the characters don't empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles.
0.93 	 The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirelli's.
0.51 	 4/10.
0.84 	 Nothing in this film interested me.
0.93 	 Kidman's performance is sad.
0.74 	 We get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox.
0.81 	 Ha!
0.72 	 Of course, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver.
0.97 	 I initially bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey!
0.54 	 another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with SRK and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes.
0.98 	 The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie.
0.73 	 It's actually a dream sequence that occurs while SRK's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze.
0.99 	 and it is just plain smoking hot!
0.72 	 Don't miss it.
0.99 	 In sum, the film is little better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average History Channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of Goebbels' life.
0.97 	 Yes AWA wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show.
0.52 	 After he went to the WWF Ken Resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who "Georgeous" Jimmy Garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing.
1.0 	 Then there's Doug McLeod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows!
0.99 	 Then he was offered more pay by the Minnesota North Stars hockey team.
1.0 	 After he left to greener money(WWF) they had Rod Trongard who's announcing style was great but different.
1.0 	 He also would say AWA the baddest,toughest,meanest, most scientific wrestlers are here right in the AWA!
0.99 	 Jumpin Jim Brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why Greg was ever his partner.
0.97 	 Jerry Blackwell(RIP)was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why Verne had himself win against him.(Puhleeeeze!)
0.98 	 I like to see the Gagne family say wrestlings real now!
0.93 	 This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense.
0.99 	 The acting is like the entire series, regular I could be worst like "Pro-life" or "We scream for Ice cream".
0.85 	 Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode.
0.99 	 Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek, it could have been a very entertaining film, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs.
0.97 	 We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant.
0.99 	 The blood and guts, that many horror film watchers enjoy, is in full swing here.
0.74 	 Kim Terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit.
0.88 	 It is not an easy thing to do.
0.99 	 I really love the opening stuff with Lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city.
0.53 	 I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European locale, though maybe not in a low budget horror flick.
0.81 	 Pretty beautiful, though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie, like say, Dead Alive.
0.98 	 I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has.
1.0 	 Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out.
0.53 	 Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done.
0.71 	 And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny.
1.0 	 Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon.
0.89 	 One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie.
0.93 	 But as the book is read, the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life.
0.94 	 These scares just don't work.<br /><br />- There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses.
1.0 	 It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere.
0.71 	 Speaking of atmosphere, other than a few moments at the end of the movie, there is none to speak of.
0.7 	 Character logic is all but non-existent.
0.72 	 Even in a movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way.
1.0 	 My two favorite are the beginning and ending.
0.97 	 The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie.
0.7 	 Overall though, these moments aren't enough to make this a good movie.
0.99 	 Those of the "Instant Gratification" era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count.
0.51 	 The fact is, "The Empty Acre" is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done.<br /><br />If you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back-story could have come off the back of a Count Chocula box, "The Empty Acre" is the movie for you.<br /><br />Set in the decaying remnants of the rural American dream, "The Empty Acre" is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby.
0.87 	 As the couple's weak relationship falls apart, a larger story plays out in the background.
0.55 	 I hope they put this show on DVD or something.
0.96 	 Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist!
0.78 	 Another episode I like is the one where Brak's Dad and their next door neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm.
1.0 	 One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is getting beaten up, blasted and zapped!
0.8 	 The Brain (or head) that Wouldn't Die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s.
1.0 	 I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror (without the blood and guts today's audiences expect).<br /><br />Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film, and none of the characters are particularly likable.<br /><br />All considered, this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality, from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash.
0.9 	 Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high quality, body onto her and force her to continue living with him.
0.79 	 Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values.
0.98 	 The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented.
0.69 	 Gimme a break.
0.91 	 Warp drives a la "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses?
0.73 	 The plot is just crazy but "rings true" to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities.
0.74 	 I don't anyone better than Kline at playing THICKheaded.
0.53 	 Oscar exclamation.
0.97 	 <br /><br />I think this is the only movie where I didn't find myself impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization; I thought she was "spot on" in every note she struck.
0.9 	 I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it real?
0.52 	 Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, in fact, it is highly probable that Hitler, in reality, was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret.
1.0 	 Third, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was charming.
1.0 	 Because he was charming.
0.85 	 If you think that, you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that.
1.0 	 Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past.
0.98 	 It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India.
0.93 	 After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie.
0.9 	 I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in UK, USA and Australia.
0.85 	 An act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas, endangering his great expedition to Troy.
0.67 	 Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent, dishonorable way.
0.89 	 He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her.<br /><br />The shot: The camera circles the two young people, without looking directly at each other.
0.86 	 What camera!
0.99 	 The Henleys watch a Blair-Witch-Project-esquire video diary left by the town's last victim, which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie.
0.99 	 Although Hamlin and Dey's performances are much better than the supporting casts', their emotional affect seems "flat" to me throughout the movie.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction.
0.79 	 It appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes, that they threw away all the elements of good story making: plot development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution/outcome.
0.81 	 What was the connection with the people at the dinner?
0.74 	 So, has it really come to this?
0.95 	 Concerning the Wayans and Co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario; Little Man.
1.0 	 This United Kingdom P.G.
1.0 	 Money they all liked, no doubt, but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality, and to a vast degree, respect for their profession and audience, they were never short off.
0.99 	 The irony here is that the two leading protagonists, played yet again, by the Wayans brothers, are so much undercover, that all recognition is non-existent, this makes for a better movie too, and it is the actor Terry Crews that gives White Chicks its substance and personality, not the Wayans.<br /><br />Yet again, with their pastiche of 1970's Blaxploitation movies, as with the 1988 movie I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie, with heavy weights as Isaac Hayes, Jim Brown, Bernie Casey and the gorgeous actress Ja'net Du Bois.
0.84 	 They have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that Cinema have given us, may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement, as their growing audiences, so far, seem to be, for when the bubble bursts, may they be as understanding too.
0.96 	 Does it even have cinematic value really?
0.53 	 Not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really.<br /><br />It's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible.
0.69 	 Also the way the girl responds to all the torments is pretty tame.
1.0 	 Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view.The sets were very glossy and nice to look at.The cast was okay.
0.93 	 He is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner I would assume.
0.99 	 When he gets home, he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about.
0.97 	 This angers him even more and he takes up with his wife, Della, asking her why the house is always a mess.
0.73 	 He pins her up against the wall.
0.57 	 He punches the wall, leaving a hole in it and walks away.
0.97 	 After that is all said in done, she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper.
0.84 	 While she is looking for a parking space, she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her.
0.8 	 Then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping.<br /><br />When she finally does leave the mall, it is closing and many people have left already.
0.89 	 She also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there.
0.71 	 When she gets to her vehicle, she gets in to start it up.
0.89 	 Yelling ensues and a mall cop (no, not Paul Blart) makes his way over to them to see what the problem is, only to have his brains blown out of his head by Chuckie.
0.95 	 Della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed.
0.54 	 <br /><br />With that, Della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons.
0.98 	 The first kill that Della performs anyway.
0.96 	 The last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing.
0.93 	 <br /><br />I will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and I was let down a bit myself.
0.98 	 I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears.
0.97 	 In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much.
0.89 	 I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified.
0.99 	 This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" show back in 1971.
0.87 	 The episode starred Sue Lyon (of Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively.
0.58 	 Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters.
0.99 	 After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!)
0.91 	 but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple.
0.86 	 With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment.
0.68 	 If my expectations weren't exceeded, they were certainly met.
0.99 	 The movie starts with a close-up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books.
0.9 	 It then begins lampooning the books immediately.
0.99 	 Writer/director Andrew Fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous, so he doesn't treat the idea religiously.
0.66 	 And if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart, it's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie's part.<br /><br />The mystery of the movie is handled more seriously.
0.61 	 I much preferred George O'Hanlon Jr.'s portrayal in the 1970's TV series starring Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew, in which Ned was a gawky, awkward kid with a little crush on Nancy.
0.9 	 The character of Corky (Josh Flitty), a twelve-year old with a crush on Nancy, is much less annoying than Max Thierot's Ned.
0.76 	 Amy Bruckner and Kay Panabaker seem appropriately cast as Nancy's gal pals Bess and George, but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Speaking of cameos, Chris Kattan (SNL), Eddie Jemison ("Ocean's 13"), and Bruce Willis all make surprise guest appearances, which just proves you never can guess which movie Bruce Willis will pop up in next.<br /><br />The movie does fail to live up to some potential.
1.0 	 It's mentioned early on that the Drews' new house is heavily booby-trapped, but Nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that.
0.97 	 Ralph Sall's score adds to the movie's suspense, but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame.
0.74 	 This was done in order to make some of Euripides' points regarding war, the Church, and Government clearer.
0.74 	 Finally, Cacoyannis' Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides'.<br /><br />The film was shot on location at Aulis.
0.72 	 In Iphigenia, she is terrible in her anguish, and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance.
0.97 	 Agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn, he dresses, as do the others, in utilitarian, hand-woven, simple garb.
0.98 	 And so in a real sense, Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War.
1.0 	 Calchas, who represents the Church, feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves, tells him to sacrifice his daughter.
0.89 	 In consenting to the sacrifice, the King comes closer to his moral undoing, but in refusing, loses his power over the masses (his army), who are brainwashed by religion.
0.97 	 The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not, until he realizes, too late, that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide.<br /><br />Is it a sacrifice or a murder, and how can we tell the difference between the two?
0.85 	 By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice--and, worst of all, the sacrifice of one's own child--Euripides/Cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal.
0.91 	 What sort of God would insist on such payment?
1.0 	 This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult.
0.9 	 Watch for the director cameo as news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the opportunity catch his Alien parody, Loaf.
0.95 	 Figured it was an early one since Casper didn't look *right*, the same way Porky Pig doesn't look *right* in the old 1930's cartoons.
0.63 	 But I digress...<br /><br />Anyway, this episode in the friendly phantom's afterlife concerns him befriending a young fox todd whom he names Ferdie.
0.99 	 I hate to leave you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long, so you can't really be too ambiguous.
0.71 	 This production, commenced in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood, and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts!
0.79 	 Elvira using her "endowments" and sexiness as a joke ("And don't forget, tomorrow we're showing the head with two things...
0.64 	 I mean the thing with two heads").
0.94 	 And, yes, that's faint praise indeed.
0.87 	 Dennis Franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself.
0.94 	 At least he made no attempt at a Spanish accent.<br /><br />The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late of a television series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of the Dallas PD.
0.97 	 He finds true love with an Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it wasn't for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship.<br /><br />Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous Sid&Marty Krofft series the Land of the Lost.
0.57 	 Then try and sit through it with a straight face.
0.93 	 There is no explicit sexual content (at least in the DVD I saw: differences in the IMDb cast list suggests the existence of other versions), and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively.
0.87 	 Paula is also Darren's lover, and when she finds May's explicit but rather poor drawings of Darren and May together, things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion.
0.56 	 Only in an English film, perhaps, could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother, politely ask her to stand up, and duly wallop her.<br /><br />In the mean time, May is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older (of her own generation) member of Paula's writing group.
0.72 	 The contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with Darren is clearly made; it is at that point that May starts to acquiesce to Paula, and Darren's worm begins to turn (he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money, if not all along, but for some of the ride).
0.83 	 This story is about the romantic triangle between a nth.
0.66 	 Yuk.
0.67 	 All three characters go back to Stephanie's home village where, through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors, we see a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy called Pierre.
0.66 	 The mother dies.
0.54 	 Well... and that's about it, really.
0.76 	 Character development is kept to a minimum, as is the denouement of the story.
0.75 	 I can see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it got nowhere.
0.8 	 I am quite the Mitchell Leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that I rented this movie but the print I got was extremely bad, so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair, the movie was so dark.
0.53 	 So dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark, you can't see a single thing.
0.9 	 That said, I believe I share the same opinion as the first review of this movie.
0.97 	 You half expect them to start singing "Make believe" from Show boat.It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of English gets slapped around by Freddie.
1.0 	 Skids is a bum who doesn't care that he's a bum.
0.98 	 Enough with plot.
0.94 	 And Lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half, a bit more is called of Freddie and he fails to deliver the goods.
0.99 	 With a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don't believe, the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure, set design, and direction.
0.78 	 If you enjoy watching kids vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth out in a bloody horror-type, go see (or rent) the film.
0.74 	 <br /><br />Skip it.
0.96 	 Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself "this is the best I could have done with the material".<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him.
0.99 	 Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years.
0.91 	 Cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west.
0.88 	 Not to repeat other reviews here.
0.94 	 So while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering (because they were clinging to characters that had been the "in" thing a few years before but were now becoming passe) Joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress.
0.98 	 The depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon.
0.99 	 He is then forced to kill Bert and after- wards he goes into hiding.
1.0 	 A lot of his roles though were weak, spineless characters.
0.97 	 And the American versions have two love scenes removed.
0.55 	 I suspect this is true, but you wouldn't know this from the film itself.
1.0 	 What really needs to happen is an American uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in.
1.0 	 Let us honor Paul Naschy's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves.
1.0 	 See it if you are at all interested in Elmore Leonard or John Frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially John Glover who's admittedly brilliant.
0.55 	 Shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, Detroit (an area where Leonard has resided for years and knows very well), to Los Angeles makes for a substantial problem that Leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately can't.
0.97 	 As consultant Ron Jeremy will tell you, 1980s Los Angeles was a colorful, stylish porno Mecca, more like the movie "Boogie Nights" than Leonard's dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor.
0.95 	 Then again, Los Angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully--there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there.
0.55 	 Unfortunately, Roy Scheider's Harry Mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome Uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat.
0.91 	 He also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with.
0.55 	 Elmore Leonard's stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law-abiding citizen.
0.99 	 Here, Harry Mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, Alan Raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image.
1.0 	 Glover's blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but Scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky "good guy," in charge of the situation as if he were more a Rambo with an M-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him.
1.0 	 Trapping Raimy inside Mitchell's Jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by Mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the "sweet revenge" conclusion of a Chuck Norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of Leonard's book, where Mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way.
0.99 	 I particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way.
0.97 	 I wanted to like Magnolia.
0.99 	 The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked).
0.53 	 Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre.
0.55 	 The Last of the Blond Bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff.
0.99 	 She doesn't take any money as she is wealthy and doesn't need it.
0.97 	 Today's generation, which grown up watching dark & realistic films like- 'Satya', 'Company' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making.
0.8 	 The film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released.
0.79 	 These women have no self-respect or dignity.
1.0 	 She was brilliant on "All That" and her own show.
0.89 	 As a mother of 2 young children who are or should I say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of Scooby I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby.<br /><br />If as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to Shaggy and Scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon.
0.59 	 But that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and gang.
0.84 	 I'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but I'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost.
0.97 	 nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos!
0.99 	 If you're an English Patient person, save your time, save your money, and save us all your "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comments.
0.63 	 Go check it out.
0.92 	 And that's OK.
0.97 	 This movie should be called Ramone Fever.
1.0 	 The Little Mermaid is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies.
0.97 	 I'll admit it has some good points to it.
0.91 	 There is some humor, I'm sure--I don't remember, because after watching it I immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again.
0.8 	 (His voice difference was very obvious to me, by the way!)
0.92 	 I know that this act (child following in the footsteps of a parent) happens, but Ariel was different.
1.0 	 That was what we loved so much about her.
0.99 	 She had a dream, she fell in love, and she made that dream come true.
0.52 	 And I don't like her.<br /><br />I know of some children who have enjoyed this film, and I know some adults who didn't mind it, either.
1.0 	 But for me, and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for Ariel, please don't see this movie.
0.94 	 The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around "exterminating" peoples pets for money.
0.75 	 I couldn't believe the comments made about the movie.<br /><br />As I read the awful opinions about the movie I actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that I did.<br /><br />What I viewed was incredible!
0.98 	 <br /><br />What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene, from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice.
1.0 	 That I don't understand, its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error I fail to see.
0.59 	 Opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded.
0.89 	 After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life, I'm now 37, but never having read the book, I am totally confused as to what I've just seen.<br /><br />I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as i'm sure most are, but only through hearsay and quotes.
0.99 	 Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.<br /><br />On the plus side...<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate.
0.62 	 The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.<br /><br />Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...<br /><br />There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who?
0.72 	 where does he come from?
0.73 	 where does he work?
0.78 	 why is he changing news reports?
0.99 	 What's the deal with his mother & sister?
0.89 	 What happened to his father?
0.99 	 I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that I've seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.<br /><br />There's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?
0.93 	 It is at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Oscars, from India, this year.<br /><br />It is such a pity that the information about this (and all other Indian movies) on IMDb is lacking and sometimes even wrong.
0.98 	 The rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all.
0.97 	 There was not even a single vote cast for 'Doghi'.<br /><br />'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie.
0.99 	 It is Marathi, and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence, does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer ware.
0.75 	 The entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in Maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists.
0.51 	 However on the eve of the wedding Gauri's to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident.
0.79 	 Desperate for help she accepts his suggestion.
0.74 	 She does not allow Krishna near her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests.
0.51 	 This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life.
0.95 	 Promises that they would face the world Â together.<br /><br />There is nothing that is not required in this movie.
0.67 	 Everything is necessary and sufficient.
0.95 	 We do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are, but virtually no specifics about any of it works.
0.84 	 )<br /><br />We see lots of things happening, but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why.
0.94 	 There's little sense of who is who, or how the various production departments fit and work together.
0.8 	 This was what black society was like before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap, and AIDS that beset the ghettos in the eighties.
0.59 	 (***)
0.98 	 i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink, and the skeletons chase him, but luckily he dodged them, opened the window, and didn't even notice them.
0.84 	 & when he stuck the needle up ma Wu's butt, its hysterical.
0.79 	 They are two lonely mimes.
0.81 	 This part is so in-your-face French and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers.
0.84 	 Nothing else happens.
0.99 	 Highly recommended both to mainstream of "pretentious" (heh) audiences.<br /><br />8 out 10
0.77 	 Let's go straight to the point: this is The Movie I would take with me on a desert island (with dvd player).
0.96 	 See the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) come on stage drunk and Maurice(Cassavetes) has to improvise because she doesn't follow the script anymore.
0.97 	 The majority of reviews that i had read, said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow.
0.57 	 And whilst some parts do leave you confused, the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much.
0.8 	 This isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.<br /><br />I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch.
0.95 	 I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films.
0.71 	 Scratch that.
0.77 	 I can't think of even one character who was portrayed well.
0.57 	 Although, in all fairness, it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way.
0.9 	 It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways.
0.87 	 And the ending was at least slightly humorous.
1.0 	 It only takes away the enjoyment of the first.
0.86 	 i was really disappointed.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real Sholay.
1.0 	 There is no camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj).
1.0 	 The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable.
0.54 	 Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language.
0.74 	 Even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done, and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through.
0.7 	 And please, please put Mandy in some more movies!
0.99 	 She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age.
0.85 	 Hollywood: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives.
0.66 	 One or the other of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me.<br /><br />MORE MANDY.
0.66 	 ;-)<br /><br />P.S.
0.91 	 Did I mention I hope Mandy makes me more movies?
0.51 	 <:-D
0.93 	 Cohen's interview is all done in lo-fi video closeups and I so wanted to see a medium or a long shot of his whole body!
0.95 	 None of the performers in this film have done even one song as good as Leonard's own music and if you are thinking about seeing this and you have any doubts at all, heed them.
1.0 	 Forget this one, and go buy Leonard's most recent album if you want to pay tribute to him.
0.85 	 Who needs more than that?
0.53 	 It will be good for the festival hype.
0.92 	 After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft?
0.95 	 Who needs to have professional level photography anyway?
0.67 	 Then hire a ten-year old who has never held a camera to be your operator.
0.97 	 It looks like a story of loss, when it is actually a story about being alone.
0.54 	 If you have ever lost and felt alone, this film will assure you that you're not alone.<br /><br />Jerry
0.88 	 The music!
0.97 	 I noted that the film has two composers listed.
0.71 	 They have never heard of the expression "less is more".
0.88 	 See it at your own risk.
0.86 	 As anyone old enough knows, South Africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population.
0.7 	 When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country.
0.99 	 Also, a love interest for the evil man.<br /><br />Where this film really excels is in the imagery.
0.98 	 The Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice and the zombie look very powerful in their large numbers.
0.76 	 Overall, a film that could be a great one with a little script re-working and could someday be a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war time frame).
0.71 	 I've seen it at least 10 times.
0.93 	 I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper's fox get killed!
0.87 	 I never saw anything like that in the other Casper cartoons!
1.0 	 It was so depressing, I just couldn't watch it again.
0.96 	 It's just like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie.
0.75 	 But when I think about this Casper cartoon, I think about my cats!
0.99 	 An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised.
0.91 	 There's a lot of talent involved here.
1.0 	 A great many talented actors, directors and writers.
0.99 	 Unfortunately, I couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had.<br /><br />First of all, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality.
0.69 	 And unfortunately some of them clash with the others.
0.92 	 Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition.
0.97 	 A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man.
0.97 	 This allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there.
0.96 	 Basically, he and friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting.
0.65 	 Cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner (who gets his eyes popped out).
0.79 	 and when he pops up (only twice) the blood begins to flow.
0.85 	 The film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named Nekron.
0.58 	 The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier.
0.66 	 Larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill Nekron.
0.79 	 The only basic complaints I have is that I wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it.
0.86 	 I also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time.
0.97 	 It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to "1999" playing on the speakers.
0.68 	 I asked people, who is this singer?
0.61 	 I was told it was Prince.
0.86 	 It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, topless dancer.
0.71 	 Later I started hearing other Prince songs and really "digging" them.
0.87 	 The movie blew me away.
0.96 	 I instantly became Prince's No.
0.62 	 1 fan of the "War Baby" generation.
0.86 	 I thought Prince's acting was fine, Apollonia struggled a bit, but all in all the acting was fine.
0.98 	 I was a bit crushed but he's still No.
0.89 	 The one thing I liked about it was.........
0.51 	 Oh yeah!!!!
0.63 	 Don't put down Stacy Dash.
0.94 	 Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen.
0.99 	 When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public's intelligence.
1.0 	 This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in "Glen or Glenda?
0.94 	 The Park Avenue set plays it; the Bohemians play it.
0.68 	 (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.)
1.0 	 I found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen, it's often best to just let things be.
1.0 	 Unless you are like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi film, this one is very skipable.
1.0 	 That reviewers liked this movie surprises me.
0.73 	 The characters are wooden.
0.97 	 This is not an edgy work.
0.98 	 It is not imaginative.
0.76 	 That is missed theatrical release is not surprise.
1.0 	 That the "This Network" airs it diminishes that venue.
0.96 	 If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk.
0.85 	 Life is short.
0.97 	 Who is Bettie Page?
0.98 	 Page was highly in demand in the post-world war II period as the queen of "naughty" pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts.
0.99 	 Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at.
0.97 	 Page visits Miami Beach.
1.0 	 Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go.
0.97 	 Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet.
0.66 	 When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A- rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class.
0.99 	 The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms.
1.0 	 I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary.
0.58 	 Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.<br /><br />But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence.
0.99 	 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest.
0.53 	 9 out of 10.
0.94 	 Allow me to start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies.
0.75 	 By the way, Van Helsing has sex with his mom.
0.69 	 It would be funny, but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously.
0.9 	 Stay far, far away from it if you value your time at all.<br /><br />I will say one thing positive about the movie: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his.
0.97 	 There's like, a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks.
0.51 	 cry me a river.
0.57 	 Other than that, you can leave it...
0.9 	 I think that can sum up this show about as well as anything.
0.83 	 Was Batman Beyond good?
0.94 	 Is Justice League good?
1.0 	 It would be unfair and besides, it has plenty of other problems with it.<br /><br />The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is a fine one, and at times the art is very nice.
0.99 	 If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures.
1.0 	 The Joker is a homicidal, mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits, unpredictability, and clever gadgets to fight Batman.
0.87 	 TAS (there I go again) took Mr.
1.0 	 Freeze from your standard icegun-wielding B villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character.
0.93 	 Of course Freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an upgrade, but the point stands.
0.5 	 They've been written for the demographic of children under twelve.
1.0 	 Should children be able to enjoy a show?
1.0 	 But the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages.
0.75 	 This show misses that mark.<br /><br />Is this show a TAS?
1.0 	 Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, first (self) published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal.
0.86 	 Although there's a lot of talk about "energy," that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon.
0.52 	 I avoided watching this film for the longest time.
0.98 	 Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it.
0.77 	 I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it.
0.51 	 Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest.
0.89 	 "Nonsense," I thought.
0.9 	 "Well, maybe," thought I.
0.57 	 Then it finally appeared on Pay TV.
0.79 	 "OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see."
0.99 	 I didn't want to like it - and I didn't.
0.78 	 First - the directing.
0.51 	 My high school public speaking contestant was right.
0.77 	 You don't just watch it; you really do feel it.
0.6 	 Then - the details.
0.65 	 Then - the song.
0.99 	 "<br /><br />Problems.
0.98 	 Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class.
0.72 	 (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.)
0.84 	 The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.
0.96 	 <br /><br />A minor quibble, though.
0.75 	 My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.<br /><br />9/10
0.92 	 The final episode was everything against the previous seven years.
0.67 	 The journey was 23 years, but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it... let say, seven years only.
0.94 	 Why not avoid the whole adventure?
0.99 	 Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey.
1.0 	 As the say, "journey is more important than the destination".
0.67 	 Unbelievable.
0.98 	 And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight.
0.96 	 I've seen other Guinea Pig films, like Mermaid in a Manhole & He Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them (however dark).
0.74 	 I'm all for disturbing, in fact, I seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible, but this was a bit much.
1.0 	 If you think that sounds great, go for it, but it certainly put me off viewing any more Guinea Pig stuff.
0.87 	 There's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of, and the gang's penchant for gay sex- at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want.
0.53 	 Some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness, like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face, or the randomness of the "interrogation" as it goes into a very twisted area.
0.99 	 I remember trying a few minutes of this film, I'm very surprised I didn't watch all of it, from director Steve Gordon, his only film directed before dying of heart failure.
0.65 	 OK.
0.89 	 I admit.
0.83 	 Because this is NOT the future, it's fantasy for kids.
0.99 	 Still, it can be irritating at times.
0.96 	 Me, being a Norwegian, have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series, like science fiction, for Scandinavian viewers.
0.92 	 I never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened.
0.89 	 No other than this guy, also an acclaimed dramatist, could construct the script of Â«BlindpassasjerÂ».<br /><br />When I finally got to watch it, it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR in the 80's, eventually managed to transform it to DVD and give it to me.
0.96 	 The writing was top-notch.
0.94 	 This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be.
0.99 	 And of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy?
0.7 	 If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; the First Movie".
0.79 	 He falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her.
0.74 	 As a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show!
0.71 	 It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance.
0.6 	 If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!<br /><br />
1.0 	 Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise.
0.83 	 This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus.
0.82 	 Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less took care of issues like medical care.
0.92 	 Seriously, why is this movie rated so low?
0.71 	 Really good actually.
0.86 	 I even cried at the end of the movie.
0.86 	 And the dancing routines are just sick.
0.98 	 First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show!!!
0.85 	 For the people Down Under, Ned Kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to Robin Hood, Jesse James, Bonnie and Clyde, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
0.96 	 He also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it.
1.0 	 It's acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers-that-be and the status quo.
0.99 	 Geoffrey Rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment.
0.88 	 There's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derring-do of the criminal lifestyle.
0.88 	 That is the start of hell for the Creed family.<br /><br />When Rachel and the kids are gone, Ellen's cat Church dies.
0.87 	 Louis buries Church, without Jud's help.
0.9 	 A couple of days later, Church returns, alive, but from hell.<br /><br />This movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me, aside from "The Exorcist."
0.95 	 Stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally, but by way of a black Cessna he seeks his victims.
0.8 	 I do admit it is a bit scary in the wee hours of the night.
0.5 	 Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight,' written and directed by Karyn Kusama.
0.99 	 And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in `gender blind' competitions, does not faze her in the least.
0.69 	 And there's no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, `I was a fighter once.
0.8 	 I lost.'
0.72 	 She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin?
0.98 	 Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector?
0.76 	 I rate this one 7/10.
0.96 	 However, that doesn't mean someone won't try to get their hands on the treasure.<br /><br />After the disappointment of Mr. Moto's Gamble, I went into Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation hoping for the best, but, admittedly, fearing the worst.
0.97 	 And seeing Moto disguised as a German archaeologist (Imagine that, Peter Lorre playing a German?
0.6 	 WWII was just around the corner.
1.0 	 I love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that I liked,but this was not one of them.
0.95 	 If you want a war movie that will keep you riveted, and amazingly enough without battles scenes, then I would suggest "Downfall" (WWII German film).
0.96 	 Or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean war/Korean film).
0.88 	 These two movies will not let you down as Winter War will.
0.98 	 I saw the trailer to this film and it looked great, so I went out and bought it.
0.61 	 As for a story, forget it.
0.98 	 If, for some reason, you like this film watch Troll 2, you will probably enjoy that as well.
0.92 	 This was that in going into this film I didn't realise that it was actually a remake of "Heaven Can Wait" another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty.
0.64 	 Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.<br /><br />Well to the actual plot of the film.<br /><br />Don't spoil the experience for yourself!
0.99 	 Don't read the plot!
0.89 	 I have grown up with Scooby doo all my life, My dad grew up with scooby doo.
0.89 	 The characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister.
0.88 	 What's New Scooby Doo is much better.
0.97 	 Why change a winning format.
0.69 	 A more drastic contrast could not be imagined.
0.97 	 Raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die.
0.9 	 Having said all this, the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evening's entertainment.
0.95 	 The crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple re-takes.
0.98 	 Off-duty entertainment by desert police becomes a "policeman's ball."
1.0 	 Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night, including the disappointment of the Scream sequels.
0.69 	 Then she meets Jackson Ripner (Cillian Murphy, Batman Beyond) at the airport, who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze.
0.75 	 What she doesn't know is he already knows her.
0.9 	 No special effects.
0.98 	 No cheap make up.
0.94 	 If not for the you, do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend, or boyfriend, or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you.
1.0 	 It was a relief that Red Eye wasn't a disappointment.
0.87 	 A flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of Craven's renaissance had it arrived right after Scream.
0.81 	 I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight.
0.85 	 I must have found the characters round, because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie.
0.82 	 And the ending, now that's sad, well... for a 7-8 year old kid.<br /><br />I had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional...
0.55 	 The protagonists (you CANNOT call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons.
0.79 	 If you're in a MST3K mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it.
0.6 	 Go rent the original Conan DVD instead.
1.0 	 (Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />I've enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar, and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro, whose superb "Devil's Backbone", set in Civil War Spain, was the finest horror film of the last decade.
1.0 	 It's no surprise, then, that this film is both well-made, well-acted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere.
0.82 	 Oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution.
0.97 	 This is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters.
0.73 	 thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph).
0.87 	 In the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again.
0.51 	 The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff, but Â Lecter aside Â it gets its serial killers right.
0.75 	 It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain.
0.81 	 Very, very creepy.
0.75 	 I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner.
0.83 	 But I think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even I'd find myself edging away from.
0.98 	 I just finished a marathon of this series, and it became agonising to watch as it progressed.
0.59 	 It's a series of vignettes with no cohesion.<br /><br />There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans.
0.81 	 There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is vastly overplayed (I used to like the song).
0.99 	 Of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories.
0.99 	 Films such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category.
0.98 	 Such a film is Maiden Voyage.<br /><br />Briefly, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, scheming ship's owner.
0.97 	 Of course, there is an all American hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day.<br /><br />This is a production that plumbs new depths.
0.87 	 However, its dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean.<br /><br />Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea.
0.89 	 You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb.
0.85 	 He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results.
0.93 	 Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team's lives.
1.0 	 .... this movie basks too much in its own innocence.
1.0 	 I think Victor Rasuk has great charisma, but deserves a real film from a real storyteller.
1.0 	 A hype which went to an extent where Anil Kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge.
0.96 	 Well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people, who have a total different stance towards life, but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem, that's LOVE.
0.96 	 Well indeed a luring theme.
1.0 	 Hey Sallu Bhai, now that Aish is getting married, at least go get some tip from Abhishek to improve your acting abilities.
0.83 	 Bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like Snatch, Memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline.<br /><br />Somewhere while I was evaluating the pre-release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie wouldn't do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28, and 28 is considered a bad number in Numerology.
0.91 	 There indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than Salaam-E-Ishq.
0.81 	 You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films, that "Kalifornia" would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't.
0.99 	 It tries to answer questions like "why do they do the things they do?
0.89 	 Is it because of something that happened in their past?
0.78 	 These are some of the things that "Kalifornia" tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves.
0.99 	 Early is possibly drunk.
0.76 	 We then see him pick up a rock, throw it off a bridge, and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car.
1.0 	 A family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mom Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10 year old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3 year old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful house in Maine--seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so!
1.0 	 The neighbor across the way (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home...and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets.
0.98 	 But a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life...but the dead come back in a nasty mood.<br /><br />""DEFINITE SPOILERS** The novel by Stephen King was good--it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened.
0.95 	 It just goes out of its way to shock you.
0.99 	 Only Gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting.
0.9 	 Truly beyond belief.
0.9 	 Ja-pan isn't really about the bread, but the reaction that come after eating the bread, and the pun that comes with the reaction.
0.56 	 The series is lovable because of these puns.
0.69 	 If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie.
0.74 	 But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it.
0.64 	 I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different.
1.0 	 So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes.
0.86 	 I remember watching it when it first came out.
0.83 	 Here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending.
0.64 	 The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life.
1.0 	 Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare starts as dream demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) leaves a teenager (Shon Greenblatt) on the outskirt's of Springwood with no memory of himself, who he is or why he is there.
0.57 	 The local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane) interviews him, she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to Elm Street in Springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for Freddy kill anyone.
0.91 	 The A Nightmare on Elm Street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them.
0.59 	 When they do finally try to kill Freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon, yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3-D glasses!
0.93 	 The body count is extremely low here with only three death's.
0.73 	 The final twenty or so minutes of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare was in fact shot in 3-D although the version I saw presented this part as normal so I can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-D which take advantage of the process.
1.0 	 Fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from Wes Craven's original classic shocker as it gets.
0.98 	 Followed by New Nightmare (1994) which tried to take Freddy Krueger & the series in a new & different direction.
1.0 	 The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in, and that is that.
0.99 	 They managed to avoid the trap of making a (bad) film version of the books we are all so familiar with, choosing instead to concentrate on a period in Modesty's life only alluded to in the novels.<br /><br />As for the production values (and I am no student of cinematography!
0.95 	 In this case I think not.
0.97 	 For me they were totally credible.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The only fault I could see would have to lie in the supporting cast.
0.53 	 Which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters.
0.82 	 Why was that colonel always in his tower?
0.81 	 How come Sunday's wife was so bitter and always drunk?<br /><br />Another curious question has to be this.
0.53 	 Maybe it's just me.
0.9 	 In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterwork.
0.73 	 With very few financial resources, I must admit it looked pretty professional.
0.99 	 I'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on IMDB.
0.75 	 **** out of *****
0.54 	 You're too good an actor for such a stink-bomb.)
0.98 	 Because the film is very different from the book.<br /><br />What the film seems to be aiming at - taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it - it achieves with perfection.
0.9 	 One might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it's a film about guilt, justice and retribution.
0.72 	 And if I remember correctly it was actually the first time Eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology.
0.88 	 Thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story.
1.0 	 The only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog.
1.0 	 Instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad.<br /><br />The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father.
0.99 	 His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a Rubik's Cube?
0.95 	 By the very nature of Brian's solitude, Jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene.
0.73 	 Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie.
0.9 	 This is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey.
1.0 	 Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today.
0.99 	 With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it.
1.0 	 Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around.
0.99 	 Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas.
1.0 	 He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.'
0.65 	 Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects.
1.0 	 He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it's really just annoying.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.'
0.8 	 She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend.
0.75 	 A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy.
0.99 	 I had such high hopes for this film because I loved the original so much.
0.86 	 They deserve a razzie.
1.0 	 What happened to the great music Disney used to have in their films.
0.92 	 Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King...even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
0.66 	 But the cops are onto him, so can he pull it off?
0.84 	 And if you don't go into it expecting much, and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is.
1.0 	 Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors!
0.74 	 I'm trying to view all of his work.
0.56 	 He has been known to single-handedly save movies with his presence.
0.96 	 Please...for the love of Christopher....avoid this film!
0.86 	 The movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very Barbarella-esque film.
1.0 	 Deep and profound?
0.98 	 This greatly parallels CQ, which also lacks an ending (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the SxSW film festival.
0.99 	 I had fairly high expectations having just watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies.
0.89 	 I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance.
0.82 	 If you want a recent sci-fi-esque indie film rent Donnie Darko, it won't put you to sleep.
0.63 	 But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity.
0.65 	 Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes.
0.75 	 Without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'.
0.76 	 I'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because I feel that is how it should be considered, and watched.
0.51 	 No Faux drama.
0.97 	 No Swelling sound track.
1.0 	 Just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts.
0.81 	 Anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films).
0.52 	 What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean.
0.99 	 No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama, and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera.
0.71 	 The type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle.
0.77 	 Some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole.
0.94 	 It doesn't try to 'tell the story'.
0.56 	 A person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours.
0.65 	 It focuses on 3 slices of time: The Battle to over throw Batista, Che's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparations in Bolivia.
0.99 	 The only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of Matt Damon.
0.97 	 In a film so loaded with true to life performances, an American, (Matt Damon) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well, but after so much care in the casting, this was an over-site.
0.93 	 Small and completely forgiven.
0.51 	 "The Sentinel", which is based on a novel by John Konvitz, who also wrote the screenplay, is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult Horror should consider missing.
0.75 	 And the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to Alice...
0.96 	 This may not be an adequate plot synopsis, but I would hate to spoil any of this film's great moments, so I will not give any further plot description.
0.98 	 Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego.
0.55 	 That just might be some sort of cinematic record.<br /><br />Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs.
0.92 	 One of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser, Jon Peters.
1.0 	 In the previous incarnations of the story, "Norman Maine" sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer "Vicky Lester" achieve her success.
0.76 	 Streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen.
0.51 	 The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable.
0.67 	 You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive.
0.92 	 The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom.
1.0 	 So much for ethnic pride.<br /><br />The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable.
1.0 	 Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees.
0.62 	 And the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning "Evergreen" by Paul Williams and Streisand).
0.55 	 The Dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for Bo after "10".<br /><br />I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys.
0.72 	 Reading the script, we -lauuughed-...<br /><br />We did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility, although our dolphins -were- in "The Big Blue!
0.98 	 "<br /><br />This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life.
0.92 	 I hope he had fun in this film, as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy.
1.0 	 He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo.
0.99 	 Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracas.<br /><br />From 1945 until 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns, some of them considered real classics.
0.99 	 Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns.
0.98 	 Williams who was along for the ride with Scott, he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Also there's a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians.
0.99 	 They escape because Gabby's mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the Indians allowing our heroes to escape.
1.0 	 <br /><br />This was Gabby Hayes's farewell feature film part.
0.97 	 Of course, the original is better, but this isn't as bad as everyone says!
0.91 	 Yes, it is made up into 3 stories, but hey, so what?!
0.54 	 I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I just think it sounds better here, more nicer.
0.65 	 A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience.
0.54 	 Paltrow is as wooden as they get.
0.62 	 This could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp.
0.99 	 A perfect little atrocity...I doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds.
0.96 	 But, hey-the rich got what they deserved.
0.94 	 15-year old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners-take notice.
0.81 	 It is an hour-and-a-half long music video where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from initial shock at their actions.
0.55 	 Decent photography, but editing is on the level of TV production class in high school.
0.79 	 I implore you all: read the book, or the cliffnotes even; watch the previous versions of it, even Kusminsky's; but stay away from the numerous future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial-free premiere.
0.98 	 This movie is hilarious.
0.5 	 Another is the trek into the "Village of Crazies."
0.99 	 This angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed.
0.95 	 Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children.
1.0 	 It was nip and tuck as to whether I was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the horribly distracting commercials.
1.0 	 After all the worst that could happen would be that I might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads.
0.91 	 So why did I watch it?
1.0 	 When the scene calls for quick witted, timely delivered verbal intercourse, she can stand toe to toe with any actor.
0.99 	 Without the commercials, which by design kill the continuity of any good film, This would have been a real edge-of-the-seat nail-biter.
0.87 	 Honestly, I find this film almost too depressing for my own good.
0.92 	 It is VERY depressing until pretty much the very end.
1.0 	 There is no way I can justify passing judgement to any character who did things I didn't like (well, except for the disgusting character played by Fredrick Forrest).
0.93 	 But it's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way, putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing.<br /><br />A horrible tragedy strikes a Montana family.
0.89 	 They believe they've lost one son, but it turns out they've lost 2.
0.83 	 Some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame (and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased...that Andy character truly is a snake!)
0.91 	 He seems to know what the child is thinking about even though Arnold isn't saying much these days.
0.57 	 It is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to.
0.73 	 No one else seems to grasp the fact that Arnold might be in shock, in denial, or that his way of grieving may not be the same style, or at the same speed, as they would expect.
0.99 	 You're not going to get some spoon-fed narration or some Hollywood feel-good resolution.
0.99 	 I was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy Andy's wife, for something he should not blame himself for.
1.0 	 Arnold may have accidentally killed his brother, but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage, which apparently was a lousy one anyway, except for the two people in the marriage.
0.98 	 It's only dumb luck Arnold didn't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer.<br /><br />Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow cannot find it in themselves to communicate with their son, to find out what Arnold is going through.
0.68 	 And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time.
0.71 	 He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community.
0.97 	 Sounds fair enough, doesn't it?
0.96 	 Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves.
0.97 	 This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword.
0.93 	 This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come.
0.94 	 Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt.
0.87 	 Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner.
0.98 	 The film is violent, but there isn't too much gore.
0.77 	 The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy.
0.93 	 The film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.
0.97 	 I think) They sneak off after a party and do it.
0.88 	 Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie.
0.85 	 If you don't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don't watch.
0.74 	 He starts out as a fix-it man for the woman, and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme.
0.99 	 If you see this one, my sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep.
0.93 	 and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level.
0.94 	 I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating.
0.97 	 I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew.
0.55 	 DVD extras include an hour long "making of" feature.
0.8 	 (although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!).
0.69 	 Anyway, if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects!
0.54 	 If you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already (I feel your pain) then these words have come too late.
0.87 	 It's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place, which is what the film's mantra ("knowledge belongs to mankind") represents.<br /><br />Yet another example of Hollywood being completely out of touch with reality.
0.71 	 I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind.
0.51 	 !
0.98 	 No one out of place or out of character.<br /><br />And it's NOT really as much a downer as you would expect.
0.89 	 I gave it 7 of 10.<br /><br />If you havent seen it, DO!
1.0 	 I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!
0.99 	 ), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly.
0.55 	 So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies.
1.0 	 The pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development.
0.99 	 If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment.
0.98 	 There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off.
0.93 	 The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!)
1.0 	 in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene.
0.97 	 Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!!
0.99 	 She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from?
1.0 	 Don't get me wrong, I love action and revenge flicks, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's latest "The Mechanik" which is quite good.
0.54 	 And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.<br /><br />But with "Man on Fire" (and even more then with "Domino"), Scott shows that rather than using his film-making "genius" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him.
1.0 	 It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into.
0.92 	 But only here does she play the female lead.
1.0 	 The only surprising waste (possibly due to cutting of scenes) is Roddy McDowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film.
0.95 	 With his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part.
0.72 	 <br /><br />As for the animation, the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon, and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view, with Tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee, and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages.
1.0 	 The problem is, it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie.
1.0 	 The plot has been used before, by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and that was a lot more fun.
0.97 	 The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice.
0.54 	 This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be.
0.96 	 Power rangers vs Freddy?
0.83 	 The rest are for little kids.
0.99 	 I know Freddy's a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons.
0.59 	 Why does it always have to be Christianity?
0.98 	 Don't' watch this, show it to little kids who loves power rangers.
0.99 	 Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching.
0.65 	 The cartoon switches between the flea's progress inside the dog's fur and the dog's desperate attempts to cope with it.
0.98 	 There's the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh.
0.99 	 Most notably, there's the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog's behind which causes the flea to wolf-whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor.
0.99 	 He momentarily breaks off to address the audience: "Hey, I better cut this out.
0.77 	 I may get to like it"!
1.0 	 I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV.
0.76 	 None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through.
0.78 	 And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't amount to anything.
0.68 	 Anything good?
1.0 	 And Donaldson is always great.
0.63 	 Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
0.66 	 Who are these people and what are they doing?
0.68 	 Filled with blood and occasional gore, The Fourth Man is truly neurosis inducing.
0.88 	 Those who only are satisfied with family life, or simply know nothing more, the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that, it just let you think of all the usual things in life (working for the car, being bounded at work etc.).
0.79 	 It's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we're living in.
0.99 	 Sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino (Caesar's Palace!
0.99 	 ), and plies him with girls (including the horny-for-money Edy Williams).
0.99 	 Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer... seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later.
1.0 	 A curiosity at best, far from Joshua Logan's usual caliber of work.
0.51 	 Dos/Dias.
0.96 	 Now go watch CASINO again...
0.94 	 This time moreover Scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star.
0.96 	 She's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy, bespectacled but still pretty coed.
1.0 	 At first Allen's decision to make Johansson a gauche, naively plainspoken, and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision.
0.74 	 His parents were English.
0.92 	 Only in the movies, perhaps (here and in "Kate and Leopold").<br /><br />This isn't as strong a film as "Match Point," but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong.
1.0 	 It doesn't matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it's diverting summer entertainment.
0.6 	 On a hot day you don't want a heavy meal.
0.85 	 Don't believe them.
0.95 	 He doesn't try too hard.
0.67 	 Why should he?
0.64 	 He may be 70, but verbally, he's still light on his feet.
0.95 	 Instead, like every other Rocky/Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market, it's about conquering adversity with stick-to-it-iveness, rendering all social/personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course.
0.8 	 Never get tired of these old musicals.
0.78 	 Whatever happened to Hollywood?
1.0 	 It's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view.
1.0 	 Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is worth the price of admission even today.
0.8 	 Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make.
0.99 	 I watch him in the Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years.
0.87 	 Here is a news flash: Want to get prisoners to talk?
0.96 	 Natasha Kinski is a main character, but has like 5 lines in the movie.
0.58 	 "Hey, funny to see you here again, on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away...see you in a few months".<br /><br />I am required to give this one star by IMDb, since there is nothing here for a negative score.
0.95 	 Even the small parts are great.<br /><br />There are so many funny scenes, Mathau messing up the commercial, Burns repeating his answers as if senile...<br /><br />A delight.<br /><br />Enterrrrrr!
0.92 	 They constructed this one as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play away with high class talent, the bored young wives of wealthy older men.
1.0 	 OK, there are lots of myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also a lot of well documented facts, still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation.
0.63 	 It's only a couple of lifetimes ago.
0.72 	 My own grandparents were already of school age when Ned was hanged.
0.98 	 Having recently read Peter Carey's excellent novel "The True History of the Kelly Gang" I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein.
0.99 	 I'll give it 3/10, and that's only because some of the nice shots of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
0.65 	 a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down, but do they, sure they do.This would not be a family film if they all died.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Sorry, but better than Star Wars.
0.66 	 Iam not good at math
0.96 	 Apparently, since the image seems a photograph, people thought they were just going to see a slide show, not something they were hoping for.
0.81 	 One simple reason: it is only fifty seconds long.
0.94 	 "I didn't want this to get complicated, Leese.
0.84 	 I have to assume she's gonna read that."
0.92 	 A lot of films I would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about, but actually I wouldn't mind a prequel to this one, which would take place with Jackson surveilling Lisa.
0.86 	 There are many plots and turns.
0.66 	 Neither was "Road Trip"!
0.63 	 "Whipped" tries to be "Swingers" without the wit or intelligence.
0.74 	 The dialogue is laced--more like drowned--with four-letter words.
0.83 	 You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence--and a more extensive vocabulary.
0.99 	 Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you'll see the difference.
1.0 	 There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by (straight) men and play out wonderfully.
0.88 	 It was one of those noticeably-written-by-a-guy scenes.
0.99 	 It definitely fits the time period as the Axis & Allies were playing espionage games throughout most of North Africa & the rest of the world.
0.83 	 It's not the best of films, but certainly not the worst of the budget films as described previously from the compilation War Classics.
0.93 	 <br /><br />Duncan"Cisco Kid" Renaldo was actually very good in one of his first feature films.
1.0 	 I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkarkus).
0.7 	 Why he never got any bigger roles is beyond me.
0.73 	 He played the perfect buddy/partner role and saved the movie...imho.<br /><br />As said, this film was part of a budget package from Superbox-Mart entitled War Classics.
0.98 	 If you can by-pass all of that and want to see the future Cisco Kid & a great sidekick that sadly never fulfilled his true potential, definitely pick it up!
0.93 	 I'm a Jean Harlow fan, because she had star quality.
0.96 	 I don't think her movies are good and I don't even think that she was a good actress, but she certainly was Great in comedies.
0.92 	 Every bit of comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good.
0.9 	 But this movie is perhaps more like a love story.
1.0 	 Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new.
0.84 	 It always impresses me much to think that Harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman.
0.86 	 Well, in this movie she does look beautiful.
0.76 	 I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night.
0.87 	 What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison.<br /><br />A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something.
0.59 	 Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him?
0.82 	 Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee.
1.0 	 But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's greatest exports on screen.
0.73 	 Carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids.
0.86 	 Paul is just out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him.
0.83 	 This is a bit of a departure for Disney, they don't spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out)and there are no musical numbers.
0.99 	 What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet.<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction.
0.58 	 However, it's the former pair that has the most trying time.
0.53 	 Mild SPOILERS contained herein.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Jet Li's movies fall into one of two categories: Shaolin period movies and movies set in modern-day Hong Kong revolving around Triads or Triad like organizations.
0.96 	 Each genre has its best and worst films.
1.0 	 `Twin Warriors' is Jet Li's best Shaolin era flick while `The Evil Cult' is his worst.
1.0 	 `Fist of Legend' while in the recent past is the best `modern era' Jet Li movie.
0.99 	 `Black Mask' without a doubt is the worst.<br /><br />Jet Li plays a self-exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability, but shortens his life span.
0.99 	 In his `new life' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian.
0.89 	 When his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them.
0.96 	 Why does Jet Li capture and hold hostage his library co-worker if he's a pacifist?
1.0 	 Is there a love story between them?
0.97 	 Why does the police chief not care when he learns of the Black Mask's true identity?
0.99 	 <br /><br />The action and martial arts sequences are way over the top.
0.88 	 Lots of blood, gore (severed body parts aplenty), explosions, and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film.
0.97 	 Unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point.
1.0 	 If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie `Black Mask' delivers.
0.67 	 For the rest of us Jet Li fans it is a true disappointment.
1.0 	 This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li: he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma, nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability.
0.86 	 If only the writer, director, or ANYONE had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film's arch villain!<br /><br />`Black Mask' was the first Jet Li film released on video in the USA after Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm glad I stayed away from it until now.
0.85 	 It may well have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor.
0.84 	 Otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of Jet Li, and have plots that are semi-well thought out and plausible.
0.84 	 3/9 stars.
0.71 	 Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population.
0.99 	 To be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime.
0.99 	 Once in a while in Indian cinema there comes along a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie.
0.83 	 And den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own.
0.95 	 Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever.
0.54 	 There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything.
0.52 	 These actors belong in daytime television soaps, or in those ridiculous Lifetime channel movies, and not in a real-life gangster/criminal tale.
0.53 	 It's as if a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" fans got together and decided to make a really "kewl flick" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would be totally rad and rockin'.
0.83 	 Trust me on this, or watch at your own risk.
0.69 	 Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead.
0.95 	 For goodness sakes, the actors cast in this film are Aussie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the voice-over guy in Countdown.
0.58 	 I was very surprised with this film.
0.82 	 It is Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal.
0.62 	 Sure there are lots of famously bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously.<br /><br />It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood.
0.84 	 This was Stewart's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore.
0.83 	 I just finished watching "El Otro".
0.81 	 I have always taken my hat off to Julio Chavez's performances, as he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow.
0.91 	 It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way.
0.92 	 There are many Henry Fool notebooks and they were all previously believed to contain nothing but mad wanderings.
0.69 	 Apparently there's much more to them.
0.97 	 But it was still painful to watch at times.<br /><br />Even so, fans will probably devour Fay Grim and beg for more.
0.5 	 We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this.
0.88 	 If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will.
0.96 	 Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT, the Colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life.
0.97 	 Unable to realize the former, and forced to prove to the world the latter, the Colonel does the only thing he can do, set about training his son's fighting cock.
0.98 	 Once he is at home, Dona Lola, his scolding wife, wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving.
0.92 	 In response to her continued question, "What are we going to eat until November (when the cockfighting season begins)", the Colonel responds, "Shit."
0.96 	 Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives, and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity, knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him.
0.61 	 Sometimes its scary how much he looks, acts, and talks like the real Elvis.
0.94 	 I have heard the detractors, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 1/2 hours to work with, and that this was being shown on television (just two years after Elvis's death!)
0.74 	 In fact I haven't seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one.
0.8 	 The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat.
0.67 	 An example of this would be when she said, "Flashlight!"
0.96 	 It is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is, and was always intended to be, a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people.
0.95 	 Despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie, I really liked it.
0.57 	 That's why I gave the move 3/10.
0.81 	 <br /><br />Still, a lot of great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as the mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life.
0.76 	 Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never get tired of watching.
0.82 	 They both try so hard to keep the peace, & then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch).
0.52 	 First, they're both on the floor.
0.89 	 Then Hunt jumps on a chair.
0.95 	 Kazihiro jumps on the desk.
0.71 	 Hunt jumps on the desk with him.
0.91 	 The fight then spills out from the office into the factory.
0.76 	 I love that after they are separated by the workers, you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand.
0.99 	 Sakamoto: Why not?
0.98 	 Nice up tempo song about Gambleing & Sex.
1.0 	 Way more entertaining than "Bleed".
0.86 	 He was a riot.
0.5 	 Hadn't been seen in years.<br /><br />Good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at Paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's out on the open market.
0.82 	 <br /><br />Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing.
0.64 	 That includes not backing relatives up when they're villains.
0.66 	 A certain Democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone.
0.99 	 They had high hopes of winning the White House that year too, but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in Albuquerque.
0.99 	 I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot.
0.99 	 But prepare yourself to have a laugh...
0.62 	 Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts.
0.93 	 A mid-air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me, especially when it's performed countless times during the movie...<br /><br />But the parts that really got me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat.
0.94 	 The screaming and shouting German voices...unbelievably funny.
0.89 	 There had never been a female singer quite like her ever before, and there never would be again (sorry, Celine - only in your dreams!
0.99 	 But by the 1970s Streisand was trying to be a "rock" singer, her albums pandering to the younger audiences, with over-wrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice.
0.9 	 Oh please - when has anyone told Streisand what to do?
0.75 	 She could have been doing good stuff like that all along, bringing audiences UP to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted.
1.0 	 )<br /><br />Supposedly Judy Garland took Streisand aside and advised her, "Don't let them do to you what they did to me," advice Streisand wasted no time in heeding - despite her protestations to the contrary, surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway.
0.84 	 Just imagine - SHE told the CBS brass how her first TV special would be done - no guests, just HER.<br /><br />But nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here.
0.98 	 ), the poignant "Why Did I Choose You?
0.86 	 The show ends with Streisand singing "Happy Days Are Here Again" over the credits.<br /><br />When it was over I said to the friend I was watching it with, "She has NEVER, EVER, done anything better!
0.98 	 "<br /><br />And she was TWENTY-THREE YEARS OLD!
0.79 	 During the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene.
0.93 	 In 1993, he burst back onto the big screen with three movies, all of which unfortunately bombed.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Wilder has decided not to use his power anymore (for anything not useful anyway) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside unbeknownest to them.
0.56 	 <br /><br />For example AP: The Naked Mile.
0.99 	 In fact, bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.<br /><br />The only reason I was able to watch to the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene.
0.98 	 In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look.
1.0 	 The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican, really.
0.81 	 The aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills.
0.91 	 This is a fairy story.<br /><br />I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for.
0.55 	 The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine.
0.95 	 If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this film is for you!
0.9 	 Sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it's worth doing right.
0.72 	 But no one wants to do the time for Cosimo's crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that.
0.73 	 This movie is remake of Italian comedy "I Soliti Ignoti".
0.78 	 I didn't watch the Italian original so I cannot judge or compare those two movies.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Maybe to say that this movie is only comedy, isn't fair.
0.52 	 This is more then that.
0.97 	 But, this one is exception.
0.51 	 Toto with his pants.
0.69 	 Cosimo with his line: "Your mother's a whore!"
0.98 	 They all trying to make some money, but simply they are out of luck.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.72 	 They just weren't very good.
0.68 	 The same production company made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia.
0.97 	 (Perhaps this was the inspiration for "Freeway.")
0.99 	 Back to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit (shades of "MST3K"); instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice.
0.89 	 It's enough to turn you off Christmas forever.
0.98 	 This and other low-rent Mexican children's' films were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the U.S. in the early 1960s; no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in American history.
0.75 	 The baby boomers who were forced to endure these "family" films as children would be all too eager to turn revolutionary.
0.56 	 wow i payed Â£3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema.
0.64 	 The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude.
0.98 	 Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys.
0.96 	 The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie.<br /><br />As you figured out from the title of the movie, Beta House, is about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of them all, falling in love.
0.75 	 Of course, the guy that has his way with the chicks is Stifler, who, along with his mates, tries to complete another apparently impossible task.
0.97 	 Interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence.
1.0 	 However, the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds.
0.69 	 Or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us.
1.0 	 If you are, you will be impressed (?!?)
0.98 	 by all the neat things this movie will reveal that You can do.
0.65 	 Shame on everyone involved.
0.82 	 First it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist.
0.87 	 Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc.
0.51 	 It's funny that he's played by Duncan Regehr though, he like totally used to be Zorro.Hell I'll give it a bonus point for that.
0.89 	 Like comedy?
0.98 	 Like romance or other human values?
0.87 	 I like the movie.
0.66 	 Come on !!!
1.0 	 <br /><br />There is only one heir apparent to Monty Pythons intellectual wit and that is Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
0.64 	 The picture is swill, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (although right out of a "Scooby Doo" episode) is interesting.
0.97 	 But as for the finale...get real!
1.0 	 I can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone, even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks.
0.55 	 The fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance, overall-- the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medal-wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head.
0.8 	 The woman transitions from one to the other--we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie.
1.0 	 The fact that Andrews as Detective Dixon is morally struggling through it all, and Douglas as Detective McLeod is not, might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesn't.
0.95 	 <br /><br />The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is effective enough in its play with types and clichÃ©s.
0.57 	 However, as the night goes on, there's somebody among them killing them off one by one.
0.85 	 I saw this in a theatre way back in 1991.
0.95 	 The premise is a good one, they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like Dee Wallace Stone on board...but it doesn't work.
0.97 	 )and a young Beverly D'Angelo as a lesbian.
1.0 	 Ava Gardner(looking great at 55)is the Realtor who showed Raines the place.
0.99 	 Cristina's lover is Chris Sarandon, whose wife "committed suicide" after finding out they were having an affair.
0.94 	 JosÃ© Ferrer has a small role as the "Priest of the Brotherhood" who informs Monsignor Arthur Kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high-rise not only housing Carradine but Raines as well.
0.56 	 Sarandon sends a hired-hand up to the high-rise one night to check out a certain room above Cristina's apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket.
0.86 	 Screaming mad on the street, Cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective Eli Wallach and partner Christopher Walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to Sarandon who is a hot-shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife's suicide.
0.85 	 That case is really a motivating factor is Wallach's dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on Cristina and if Sarandon has anything to do with it.
0.9 	 You also have Martin Balsam as a professor who understands this type of Latin Cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer and Tom Berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room(now renovated)that Cristina once stayed in!
0.63 	 Their characters are just left on the back-burner.
0.99 	 Not to mention Gardner's role in the grand scheme of things..she brings people to that high-rise, but what is really her reasons in the film?
0.99 	 "Laugh, Clown Laugh" released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito.
1.0 	 Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta.
1.0 	 Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina.
1.0 	 While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta.
0.87 	 Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter.
0.71 	 That kind of "ick" factor permeates throughout the film.
1.0 	 Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther).
0.97 	 Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love).
1.0 	 The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career.
0.72 	 While I adore Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy.
0.9 	 The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France.
0.98 	 And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter's character.
0.67 	 Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce.
0.91 	 In short, another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment.
0.73 	 She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts.
0.8 	 In desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay.
0.89 	 And as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him.
0.95 	 (not in that perverted way!)
0.73 	 As such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.
0.97 	 Of course, under the code of Bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded.
0.97 	 A fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared.
0.63 	 You, too, will want a sequel to find out.
0.94 	 This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train.
1.0 	 I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn.
0.76 	 Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character.
1.0 	 It was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles.
0.99 	 Unfortunately, in cases such as these, there are so many conflicting stories as everyone tries to cast blame on to others that it is a near impossibility to get a clear picture of what really happened.
0.99 	 As in the real life case, there is no clear answer, no conclusion, and the audience is left with a general felling of being unfulfilled (like coffee without the caffeine, or sex without the climax).
0.99 	 Whodunnits with no whodunnit are generally frustrating and makes you wonder why someone didn't do research before they put it out there.
0.97 	 At least tout your movie as a fiction if that is what it amounts to (and this does).<br /><br />That is not to say there are not some great performances here.
0.81 	 Bosworth's apple-cheeked performance is at time annoying, at times touching, but shows none of the backbone the real Schiller must have possessed.
0.98 	 The other characters fade in to the woodwork which is a pity.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The fault of this movie does not lie with this cast, but with the writing.
0.99 	 The story and characters may have been less than sympathetic, but in what movie of this ilk are they not so?
0.9 	 Had someone bothered to try and find the truth, this would have been an intriguing story.
0.77 	 I went in to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations.
0.89 	 - but I do expect them to be internally consistent.
1.0 	 A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned up on ancient Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent "paranormal division" - which has gone unremarked up to this point.
0.95 	 A reincarnated pair of long dead Koreans who "died like star-crossed lovers."
1.0 	 However, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - Arirang!
0.79 	 No doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job.
1.0 	 I only watched it because of some good comments posted here.
0.99 	 Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD-ROMS, but when disaster befalls "Mistress Vanessa", virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a "sex slave" at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a "dungeon party".
0.99 	 Two FBI field agents (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites), in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her.
0.84 	 Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D.
0.74 	 's Operations-South Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film.
0.67 	 This movie has some kills and its moments, but I find it to be on par with the original, I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies.
0.98 	 I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then.
0.92 	 I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it.
0.84 	 I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts.
1.0 	 Fresh and immediate, the film starts with absolutely no explanation.
0.7 	 The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years in the past.
0.73 	 That message is so non-PC, I am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the Federal government via the IRS down on the makers like they did to Juanita Broderick, Katherine Prudhomme, the Western Journalism Center, and countless others who dared to speak out.
0.85 	 Granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter, tempted back to the plains one more time by kill-crazed Taylor.
0.98 	 Taylor, on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo, or Indians to 'being with a woman.'
0.88 	 Considering when this was made, the Censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the 'bawdy house', Taylor's relationship with the squaw, and much of the dialogue.
0.98 	 Several years ago our local ABC affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick (ie "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc).
0.69 	 Content that any decade was better than the 70s.<br /><br />For those still reading...the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a--holes who decide to suck up to their s---head boss (Griffith) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans California & Mexico.
0.99 	 Although I have an excellent copy that I taped off TV I WISH this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness.
0.86 	 As they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit, they hold a meeting that chooses to hire Tollinger to rid the town of it's unsavoury elements.<br /><br />Man With The Gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one, at the time of me writing this, it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it.
0.95 	 That the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel, probably hasn't done the film any favours over the years, i myself read the synopsis and thought it's just another in the line of similarly themed pictures.
0.97 	 The rest of the cast are also very much in Mitchum's shadow, so really it's solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high, perhaps it's unfair to single out Ted de Corsia for a kick, but Man With The Gun's minor failings are with its villains, and sadly de Corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace.
0.99 	 Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity.
0.94 	 The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man.
0.76 	 The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to "do something about it."
0.69 	 He's a dentist, decent looking, good father.
0.71 	 Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this?
0.85 	 Who knows.
0.8 	 A root canal is more interesting.
0.99 	 Nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes.
1.0 	 The scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists.
0.82 	 When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance.<br /><br />Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type, as it is not so predictable.
0.64 	 Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion of course.
0.78 	 He was constantly surrounded with people too!?
0.98 	 <br /><br />I felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil.
0.53 	 The clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick.
0.51 	 !
0.72 	 That is sad for a Disney movie!!
0.98 	 Thank You!
0.51 	 !
0.99 	 I guess this just wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so fascinating about it, this was *barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history.
1.0 	 Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them.
1.0 	 It's probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the showy type, as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie.
0.99 	 As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt the actress are great.
0.8 	 An actor/actress can play any kind of role when he/she can look like it.
1.0 	 Gong Li is great, but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style.
1.0 	 All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN.
0.95 	 Michlle Yeoh, one of my favourtie actress, did not even LOOK LIKE a Japanese.
0.97 	 Some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with which I can't agree more.
1.0 	 These are so delicate that I assume not even all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha, let alone the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture that much.<br /><br />Geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of American audiences.
1.0 	 This movie deserves credit for its original approach.
1.0 	 It combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling.
0.95 	 The theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely.
0.81 	 But it was wrong then and now to let a youngster watch psycho-dramas like The Searchers and The Last Hunt.
0.99 	 Let the kids wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred.<br /><br />Why did Mom fail to censor these films?
0.75 	 The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians.<br /><br />Today a large remnant bison herd resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
0.75 	 Linclon signed the Congressional act which authorized the continental railroad and started the buffalo slaughter.
0.85 	 In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic.
0.67 	 Does anybody do it better than O'Toole?
0.84 	 I don't think so.
1.0 	 They have had puking, eating pubes-covered pizza, jumping in stinging nettles, naked paint balling, jokes on the smaller guy while heavily sleeping/snoring, stunts in a work place, e.g.
0.98 	 army, cowboys, and many more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomit, maybe not just for themselves.
0.91 	 Starring Matthew Pritchard who does pretty much anything, Lee Dainton also up for just about anything, Dan Joyce (the British one) who hardly does much physical stuff and has a OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, but is more popular for being short, fat and lazy.
0.73 	 And since the movie received an R rating, I expected to see her nude.
0.97 	 They provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides.
0.99 	 This also happens to be the debut of Ralph Macchio who's the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school.
1.0 	 The others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and Ms. Bach, an Arab who worships motor oil, and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin's character) so much, he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy.
0.77 	 Among the supporting cast, Tom Poston plays a swishy character named Sisson who I found partly amusing.
0.85 	 Another one of the "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz who was born in my birth town of Chicago, Ill.
0.94 	 He played Rodney Ververgaert.
0.99 	 He also says one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
0.83 	 Genius.<br /><br />Any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window.
0.83 	 Having first watched the movie at 14, I remember being struck by hearing the word 'govno' (sh*t) for the first time ever on the then-still-Soviet TV (I bet it really was *the* first time in history Â anyone wants to add this to trivia section?:)...
0.68 	 impression: helplessness.
0.99 	 trailers and posters:).<br /><br />Funnily, that 'govno' episode is in no contradiction to Efenstor's comment above re rude language of current generation... From what I've already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this, but it was not.
0.9 	 A mild word by current standards, it was way too rude back then, and just rude enough to show the true nature of all Sharikovs... BTW, re Efenstor's lament, it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon, especially for Russian speakers, where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation!
0.51 	 (*1/2)
1.0 	 <br /><br />It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer to some weekend.
0.91 	 And I gave it a high 7.....<br /><br />Why?
1.0 	 <br /><br />Sadly this is why the show was doomed.
1.0 	 I don't know I still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that IMHO is it's only flaw.
0.59 	 Prison is set in Wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re-open an old state penitentiary that has been closed for 20 years, Warden Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith) is put in charge.
0.92 	 200 odd prisoners are shipped in & they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including Burke (Viggo Mortensen) who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber, he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out & all the electrics, gas & fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes.
1.0 	 The script was by Empire Pictures regular C. Courtney Joyner who was responsible for writing such 'classics' as Class of 1999 (1990), Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) & Puppet Master vs.
0.74 	 For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes.
0.71 	 Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy!
0.83 	 but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, this one is worth checking out.
1.0 	 he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character.
0.62 	 heck if i can remember her name though.
0.98 	 Here he offers a foundation, that "Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in "heaven"<br /><br />follow?<br /><br />lets see if the filmmaker is being honest; Hebrews 7; 14.
0.74 	 Once he engages in these tactics, in my strong opinion, he loses credibility as the religion he picks out, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion, and a bias of the film maker, nothing more, nothing less.
0.92 	 My flatmate rented out this film the other night, so we watched it together.<br /><br />The first impression is actually a positive one, because the whole movie is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture.
0.99 	 Fast sequences, cool angles, sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another "Snatch", for the moment....<br /><br />When the plot actually starts unfolding, one starts to feel as if one over-dosed amphetamine.
0.87 	 i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes, but then again, the film is so bad that you are actually better off NOT watching it.<br /><br />First you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu.
0.79 	 Rather on the contrary, Domino's lesbian come on on Lucy Liu's character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.<br /><br />Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter.
0.99 	 In any case, that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes.
0.97 	 There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage.
0.65 	 I wonder if the real town's name was close to "Blainsworth" (which is the town's name in the movie).
0.97 	 The problem was that by then you would be able to hear it.
0.91 	 I mean, give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and F5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house.
0.95 	 Savannah, before she turned into the plasticized Barbie Doll she became as a porn queen, is really interesting to watch--she's drop-dead gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times, glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time, which is more than can be said for the audience.
0.79 	 Charlton Heston did a pretty good job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted.
0.69 	 I would have rated it a 10 if they had had "Hassie" and "Little Luke".
0.87 	 There wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion.
0.87 	 They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance.<br /><br />Anyway, I was glad that TNN ran the series again!
0.8 	 A remake of Fisher King?
0.83 	 And how does this psychotic character function in his daily life?
0.9 	 Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to turn violent on him?
0.68 	 If they were such good friends, how did they grow apart?
0.78 	 Lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly.
0.85 	 Perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed.<br /><br />Of course, the bikers terrorize a small town.
0.93 	 We also learn that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled.
0.81 	 Susie is going away to college, and we abruptly learn that Joe's wedding is still on (but with a different bride).
0.83 	 End.
0.94 	 The past creeps up on a rehab-addict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox.
0.65 	 "Life's dramas", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even the writing has any bite or wit).
0.9 	 Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure but I think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men, estranged brothers growing closer, never quite gels, never feels natural or seems lived in.
0.96 	 "The Perfect Son" is quickly diffused by too many cooks in the kitchen.
0.91 	 Der Todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen, but the meaningless apathy or depression most people's lives consist of in general.
0.53 	 Buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living, only reasons to stop, and in choosing how and when you die, you can also be the king of death, Der Todesking.<br /><br />Buttgereit's movies are generally difficult to categorize and Der Todesking is no exception.
0.67 	 This film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film.
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie.
0.84 	 The main problem wasn't that art, by all means, is susceptible to endless points of view, but that a lot of people just don't get it, that every single human got his own genuine taste, his own opinion, hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made, can also be your worst one ever, and how that is right both ways, but how many people can understand this correctly?.
0.99 	 However, the only way to evaluate this "thing" is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society's mentality, imagination, and nature.
0.93 	 I can't stand this, so how about analyzing it, then discovering the potential beauty in it !!
0.74 	 The deadly cinematic technique, the effective sense of silliness, and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious.
0.58 	 It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor.
1.0 	 There is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera (!)
0.76 	 Plus the people are wearing clothes that are un-befitting for a space program.
0.85 	 Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot.
0.99 	 While decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, Ms. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed 2, 28 Days) leave much to be desired.
0.51 	 Using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion.
0.97 	 from such cinematic offal as "It's Pat" to the recent 80 minute yawn, "A Night at the Roxbury," many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen.
0.89 	 and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself, you will find this movie to be eminently quotable, "ooh, it's a lady!"
0.97 	 I only hope that he can find Armani prison wear to go off in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in $4500 designer overcoats, a $7300 designer silk suit, and seeing his $3500/month Los Angeles bachelor pad loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh.<br /><br />2) Leading lady Tracey Phillips has gorgeous porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems styled even when mussed, and amazing breasts that are hi-lighted in the 2nd half of the film by a designer silk pullover that sadly remains in place over her torso even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to Satan.
0.99 	 The only Professional Psychics I have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud.<br /><br />4) I forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his "How's it going', Buddy Boy?"
0.93 	 line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since "THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY!!"
1.0 	 And since Zippo lighters need to be manually filled with lighter fluid that can often leak out and be absorbed by ones clothing, the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your $7300 Gucci silk suit strikes me as being much more dangerous.<br /><br />6) The stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual stuntpeople risking life and limb to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal BOMB ratings from critics when released.<br /><br />7) Movie satanists always amaze me: Here is a guy who has tapped into some Luciferian bid for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him, he instead possesses bag ladies and have them levitate outside of people's apartments.
0.94 	 Speaking of which here is a guy who is indestructible, can fly, and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies -- and yet he obliges star Lou Diamond Phillips with an ordinary fistfight in the film's conclusion, yet does not have the good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure that he wins.<br /><br />And on and on ... To be watched in the company of wise-cracking friends while consuming beer.
0.97 	 You'll have fun so long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously.<br /><br />4/10
0.89 	 The DW are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise.
0.66 	 "Hey, do you haver a drivers license?"
0.58 	 8 out of 10
1.0 	 I ended up getting something entirely different, which is not at all a bad thing.
1.0 	 I don't know that I would say Dog Bite Dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal, good cop, but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film (unfortunately).
0.58 	 So many films, especially Hong Kong action films I find, portray police in what is frankly a VERY ignorantly idealized light.
0.93 	 It says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are, rather than simply condemning them.
0.79 	 There is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me, but for some reason this one really did.
0.9 	 There were some moments that I found really striking, particularly in the last segment of the film, but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just OK. Another slight problem I had was with the pacing, which I also felt was uneven.
0.61 	 I found a lot of the "looking for a boat" scenes to be a little alienating, all though it quickly picks up after that.
0.9 	 All of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind, but there was something very human about all of them that I couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them, particularly Chen's girlfriend.
0.97 	 He's a poor dirt farmer from the South, who wants to become a Navy diver- but has problems because of his race.
0.97 	 Suddenly, she hears Azaria crying.
0.89 	 As Lindy rushes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, shaking his head.
0.78 	 The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo.
0.99 	 Although the entire camp looks for the baby, she is not found.
0.86 	 How could this happen?
0.85 	 The entire country turns against the Chamberlains, in part because they are seen as odd.
0.63 	 The costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are all top of the line.
0.98 	 If you have never seen or heard of this film, remedy that straight away.
0.92 	 It is not a far cry from reality to say that this "Cry" should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media.
1.0 	 I have seen many, many films from China - and Hong Kong.
0.96 	 I watched 'Platform' yesterday evening and thought that Jia Zhang Ke's other two films must be better.
0.78 	 I will not be watching 'Xiao Wu' tomorrow evening because I have just placed all three films in the bin!
0.71 	 Whoever gave this film, 'Platform' ten out of ten, needs to watch more cinema!
1.0 	 Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage any day.
0.63 	 Why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon.
0.99 	 You want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers".
0.98 	 Here's the good news first.
1.0 	 "Spirit" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release.
0.84 	 Simple as that.
0.71 	 The animation is still mind-blowing; I just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.
1.0 	 The message of this movie is "personality is more important than beauty".
0.54 	 The direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction.
0.67 	 So your bairns are away on a sleep-over ?
0.87 	 It's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking?
0.74 	 So now what are you going to do?
0.52 	 The cast are never out staged though, even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas.<br /><br />Oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer!
0.96 	 This movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should.
0.83 	 Unless your a diehard Jenna Jameson fan there is little here.
0.51 	 4/10
0.51 	 SUcks.
0.66 	 Hell what a paradigm shift!
0.93 	 This is an action Western.
1.0 	 James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor.
1.0 	 The scenery and costumes are great.
1.0 	 There is action and adventure.
0.71 	 He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters (cut not that bad).<br /><br />Still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable.
0.98 	 Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make this worth watching.
1.0 	 Alan starts to lose his mind, he convinces himself that everything is decayed & rotten, just like his patient's teeth, & it's up to him to fix it.
0.92 	 It goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again!
0.99 	 I liked the ending too where the tables are turned, I'll say no more...<br /><br />Director Yuzna does his usual fine job here, in fact I don't think I've seen a Yuzna film that I didn't enjoy to some extent, he obviously & predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out, sexually molesting them, performing operations on drugs & torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill.
0.97 	 There are some other gore scenes as well, a dead dog, someone gorily slashed with a knife & cut out tongues.
0.88 	 Yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget, he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles & I liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed & huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle.<br /><br />Technically The Dentist is fine, decent cinematography, music & production values although some of the special make-up effects look a little unconvincing.
0.91 	 Other reviewers have pointed out Staden's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise.
0.85 	 I would almost give it 10 out of 10.
0.92 	 However, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss-leading which hurt the flow/continuity of the film.
0.78 	 The characters are complicated and so is the story line, expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head, it's a film where all is explained in the end.
0.73 	 To be honest the movie had it's moments...I thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it.
0.57 	 So does this mean Budah or Tailor made dumped New York or does this mean New York dumped the winner?<br /><br />I know Flavor of Love is coming up to it's 3rd season, so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and a I love New York 3.....will there ever be a true winner??
0.98 	 ?<br /><br />I've also heard a few rumors that Chance WILL be brought back for the 3rd Season of I Love New York!!!!
0.9 	 I have also heard rumors that New York will be Specially featured on Flavor of Love 3.
0.91 	 The main problem of the first "Vampires" movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic.
0.79 	 Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire.
0.98 	 Unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't Carpenter use more of this??)
0.99 	 this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been.
0.82 	 While "Los Muertos" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as "Vampires" did).
0.97 	 Much like "Vampires" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense.<br /><br />Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie but it definitely isn't.
1.0 	 It is neither an unoriginal Dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like Blade II.
0.99 	 It simply could have used a bit more excitement.<br /><br />I'd really like to see a third installment made by Carpenter but it's probably not going to happen.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING The ending was way too predictable.
0.7 	 This is one creepy movie.
0.55 	 He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him.
0.96 	 Or maybe just drive him mad?
0.78 	 It might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed he never saw the German film).
0.82 	 To achieve this, the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view, tilted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others.
0.85 	 In another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance, she is being watched by other inmates.
0.88 	 I found Barbara Joyce hot in a school-marm kinda way, and Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie.<br /><br />Watch this with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porn.
0.51 	 I don't think most people know what a "walker" is or will really care.
0.91 	 I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end.
1.0 	 He played his character (Car) flawlessly.
0.98 	 You really did get a great sense of what a "walker" may have been like (say twenty years ago).
1.0 	 He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it.
0.96 	 Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.
0.82 	 The base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice.
0.52 	 Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash.
0.73 	 Honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie.
0.88 	 I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation.
1.0 	 Sean Bean is great, as are the photography, locations and costumes.
0.81 	 Unfortunately, this adventure is much better read than watched.
0.93 	 It sets the tone for his later trials as a commanding officer.<br /><br />Rating: "4" of "10."
0.98 	 I do have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick, he doesn't look it.
1.0 	 A person of 0 T4 cells would look quite ill - not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed.
0.54 	 A small gripe, but one that makes it a bit less realistic.
0.76 	 I feel like I got my money's worth.
1.0 	 Who started out as a hopeless yet harmless "white trash" husband became realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind.
0.99 	 It was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death.
0.79 	 I mean that.
0.81 	 I do believe that everyone should see this movie though.
0.67 	 I truly do.
1.0 	 First of all, yes, animals have emotions.
0.7 	 The filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour, and when it happens they say, "That monkey is almost human!"
0.63 	 (that's actually a direct quote).<br /><br />Everything is in human terms.
1.0 	 They even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat.<br /><br />I had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms.
0.94 	 I wanted to learn how animals emote in their OWN languages.
0.91 	 Half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities.
0.99 	 One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning (though you have to be quick to notice it) where a captive monkey says in sign language, "Want out.
0.71 	 Hurry go.
0.71 	 Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a "mother figure".
0.69 	 The dialog sounds like someone reading the news.<br /><br />This is rated as comedy/drama/romance, it's not of those things !
1.0 	 Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the "game" when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri.
0.96 	 The job involves "lifting" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will enact his punishment.
0.97 	 So Raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand.
0.99 	 But the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes.
0.86 	 All of whom deserve better.
0.99 	 Enough acting horsepower there to propel a Porsche 998 Turbo.
0.73 	 Trouble is, is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park, mucho characters, not enough zest.
0.84 	 Halicki's 1974 indie movie of the same name, with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie.
0.91 	 There's one or two high impact moments, daft for sure, but enjoyable none the less.
0.51 	 4/10
0.99 	 The mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month (outsourcing) what they would have to pay Strauss/Emory in a day.
0.93 	 There are no jobs left in the rust-belt (Ohio) and they must move on.
0.77 	 Something that few care to face until personally affected.
0.77 	 The most controversial decision they're willing to tackle today is how much eye make-up to put on Katie Couric.<br /><br />If you want to make a bunch of folks really, really mad - let them discover the truth about themselves.
1.0 	 I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years.
0.81 	 You can always tell when they are switching them off.
0.9 	 This is a "family" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much.
0.97 	 This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Terrible show.
0.82 	 TVG 30 mins.
1.0 	 Isabel Allende's magical, lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized.
0.98 	 All of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned, as if, by putting forth as little effort as possible, they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets.
0.99 	 (Yes, the film was art directed within an inch of its life.)
0.64 	 "The House of the Spirits" should have been the motion picture event of 1993.
0.76 	 Without spoiling this part of the story too much, it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father.
0.92 	 Unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but, to put it simply, it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since, rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film, the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it.
0.96 	 As it is though, despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters, the way it was handled made it feel tacked on, and almost, insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across.
0.73 	 Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in.
0.92 	 The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet).
0.62 	 I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, in whole but usually in part, escaped the Holocaust.
0.56 	 Those days were simply not discussed.<br /><br />So Hannah, having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing.
0.93 	 Were she not, this would have been a very short film.
0.61 	 With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use "Israel" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false "Israel" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation).<br /><br />While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to "Aryans" were exempted.
0.99 	 The crowd of anxious women builds up, some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them ("Jew-loving whore" being one appellation).
0.75 	 <br /><br />Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail.
0.94 	 A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive.
0.62 	 But that's understandable.<br /><br />The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested.
1.0 	 Unfortunately that argument is nonsense.
0.81 	 Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism.
0.76 	 then the middle is at the beginning, and so on, when I first watched it, I expected a soggy pixely look, but Jason, Like me, Loves looks, so took every detail to the max.
0.6 	 Alan Alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows.
0.53 	 Oh, well, this movie starts off well.
0.51 	 It's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie.
0.99 	 I liked an earlier Greydon picture, "Angel's Revenge" because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys.
0.51 	 !
0.99 	 It's not too difficult to read for those out there that don't read often so don't be afraid!
0.92 	 It's a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80's soft porn movie.
0.87 	 It's far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent what the movie is about at all.
0.93 	 Those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed.
0.77 	 Just remember this movie was made in 1982, so don't expect the Hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days.
0.56 	 This is what I like about it.
0.51 	 Who knew she hid this talent?
0.91 	 This movie will give you an entirely new impression of her.
0.56 	 What they don't know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever HE says.
0.74 	 The scary thing is that he does them so well; I've actually KNOWN people like him before, no, not killers, but with pretty much the same mindset.
0.74 	 Anyway, as the road trip goes along, Carrie guesses that the others are about out of money, but Earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow....never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though.
0.56 	 7 out of 10.
0.87 	 This movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story.
0.58 	 Not fake, just natural.
0.69 	 So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie.
1.0 	 ...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless.
0.84 	 The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film.
0.81 	 true to form the British marched straight into withering American fire.
0.97 	 Was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of "Professor Jared diamond?".
0.97 	 None of this helps me understand his theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel."
0.99 	 BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said about 100 times.
0.83 	 Stay tuned and find out!"
0.8 	 Europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons.
0.94 	 The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin.<br /><br />In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans.
0.99 	 Kids may enjoy this more than I, though.
0.95 	 I have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
1.0 	 Singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with.
0.63 	 In addition, there are a bunch of "might-makes-right" messages like when our local Nazi jerks get beat up.
0.84 	 In this instance, I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one.
0.6 	 Well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country.<br /><br />Having established the rape, how does Singleton deal with it?
0.96 	 A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead.
0.98 	 Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest.
1.0 	 Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!
0.89 	 Even so this is a film that is difficult to watch and maybe should have never been made.
0.52 	 The only good actor was Colm Meaney.
1.0 	 Claire Denis's movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate.
0.94 	 "<br /><br />Now, ever since I saw "Chocolat," I've made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes.
0.98 	 She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one.
1.0 	 <br /><br />You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent BÃ©atrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil," GrÃ©goire Colin, and that Lithuanian or Russian girl.
0.86 	 For one thing, the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in "Beau Travail").
0.74 	 Oh, there were a few pretty shots, and if you liked "Friday Evening" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus."
0.84 	 In "Chocolat" the silence is sublime; in "L'Intrus," it's just dull.
0.91 	 It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created.
0.99 	 Oh dear.<br /><br />As you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie.
0.94 	 Thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout.
0.51 	 The film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing.
1.0 	 I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma.
0.97 	 I'd rather watch Jesus is een Palestijn, without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves.<br /><br />Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and appearantly never will be.
0.56 	 Why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain.
0.96 	 I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film.
0.56 	 That's way too funny.
0.91 	 Legend of Zu cannot be A Man Called Hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all.
0.58 	 I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the "Law and Order" series', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on "Lifetime.
0.98 	 "<br /><br />Finally, I found a kind of "story within a story" fascination with Josh's concoction of his being the "victim" of his teacher.
0.91 	 He is tortured, ashamed, but vicious as well.<br /><br />If you can take the incredibly dark subject matter, (and it is *very* disturbing), then you should see this movie.
0.99 	 A young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself.
0.95 	 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won't turn out like his father.
0.99 	 All the stock characters are in place: the nice couple; the "funny" guy; the tough (but sensitive) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses--that's how we know); the nerd and two no-personality blondes.
0.95 	 My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he's fully dressed!
0.93 	 All I can say to those who are amused by it is that they must be very easily entertained.
0.98 	 Today we call them "home movies," and they are just as boring now as this one is
0.94 	 The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes Tinseltown in the early days.
0.56 	 I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites.
1.0 	 It's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial.
0.69 	 Any possible God, no matter the religion.
0.92 	 Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey.
1.0 	 Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution.
0.86 	 At least, you don't think that when you see her.
0.87 	 ] Haven't seen this film?
0.89 	 Haven't even heard of this film?
0.69 	 It wouldn't surprise me.
0.86 	 The independent company Kino Films, gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion, and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it.
1.0 	 Taking that into consideration, it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment.
0.68 	 One of the longest segments, "The Dealers" is not that funny to me and I don't know what it is parodying.
0.86 	 Some of the others, though, are absolutely side-splitting.
0.97 	 Most of the foul words I know are used in the movie, and, if you object to full frontal nudity, stay away.
0.87 	 When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires him.
0.84 	 Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (Kathleen Harrison) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop.
0.99 	 Soon he has a whole chain of stores.
0.7 	 His state-room mate is Mr. Grey (the ever quiet and proper Wilfred Hyde-White) who is somewhat, silently disapproving of Max.
0.58 	 I am right now in front of the tv, watching Casomai.
0.79 	 It is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving.
0.76 	 It is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds.
0.91 	 It is a simple story of a couple as I said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but I am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end!
0.81 	 I'm sure make-up did it's best to hide it.
1.0 	 Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be told true.
1.0 	 The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true to the book.
0.8 	 The vilification of the Germans can be compared to the way "The Patriot" of 2000 did the same to the British.
0.86 	 The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim.
0.82 	 They even had Pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a German submarine.
0.93 	 All throughout the film DeMille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed.
0.78 	 The way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in "Jurassic Park" were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors.
1.0 	 If I was any more gullible to such propaganda I would punish myself for having a part-German ancestry.
0.68 	 <br /><br />Was it a good film?
0.98 	 Aside from a humorous running gag about Americans abroad thinking they're untouchable Â that was apparently a joke even back then Â you might not be entertained.
0.63 	 You'll find it more than a little melodramatic, and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before Potemkin's false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movie's potential for propaganda.
0.95 	 It made me wonder: what became of Cecil B. DeMille?
0.98 	 Ben Hur looked expensive, but not ambitious.
0.69 	 In a sentence, this movie is for 1) Film historians, 2) Silent Film Buffs, 3) Mary Pickford fans, or 4) DeMille fans, if such a person exists.
1.0 	 The last reviewer was very generous.
0.77 	 I quiet like the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this one very much.
0.81 	 The beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill pretty quickly.
0.94 	 Why Una is able to communicate with Jovi?
0.94 	 Having seen the first two episodes thus far, I think I can safely say this show isn't going to be on my must see list.
0.93 	 The other actors do their best but with the clichÃ© characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it's a tough job.
0.94 	 Both his character as well as Tara's also seem a bit racist to me.
1.0 	 The romance stuff is very Dark Shadow-sy.
1.0 	 Although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten.
1.0 	 But unlike a show such as Buffy, that pulled camp off masterfully, this show does not.
0.99 	 Elmer is some poor sap who buys Bugs from a pet shop--there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to smithereens!
0.99 	 In later films, he messed with Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it--they messed with the rabbit.
0.66 	 My, how the mighty have fallen.
0.99 	 Kim Basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role.
1.0 	 Don't you just love America?
0.99 	 I was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12A here in the UK.
0.98 	 So the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby, getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.<br /><br />Up until now, I have enjoyed most of the output from the Wayans Brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.<br /><br />A Bit of good advice - wait till it comes on TV or Cable
0.57 	 Bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but that seems more metaphor than reality.
0.98 	 Well, almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor.
0.91 	 (I'm guessing here.)
0.66 	 His course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as "media."
0.98 	 Two hippos are neck-deep in the river, staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank, and one hippo says to the other, "I hate her."
0.76 	 She's a good actress.
0.83 	 But so is everyone else in the film.
0.99 	 And it all comes from the actress too, not from directorial aid.
0.98 	 The walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands.
0.88 	 The sexy parts are pretty erotic, not so much because one of them is explicit, but because we've gotten to know the characters involved.
1.0 	 Actually there isn't THAT much sex.
0.92 	 There is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time.
0.56 	 They have to carry it and they do.
0.55 	 If it were not for their performances, I'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is.
1.0 	 It could easily have been turned into a rather slow, boring romance.<br /><br />Worth it.
0.68 	 Okay, if you've seen The Ring, you've basically seen The Grudge.
0.78 	 And it's not really clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything.
0.75 	 Who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad?
0.79 	 And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her?
0.92 	 You get 5 writers together, have each write a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make one movie out of it.
0.93 	 4.5 is giving it an awefully high rating.
1.0 	 While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and by the end, I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5.
0.96 	 I thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on.
0.96 	 Even my A.D.D couldn't keep up.
0.91 	 It felt like a slight acid trip.
1.0 	 Everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything.
0.76 	 I really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie.
0.54 	 I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history.
1.0 	 I originally thought the animation was flat and boring.
0.91 	 Whenever he goes into his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin filling the screen.
0.72 	 Skip McCoy is a three time loser pick pocket, unable to curb his instincts back on the street, he picks the purse of Candy on a subway train.
0.98 	 I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it.
0.71 	 He was not as good as one would expect.
1.0 	 Tim Roth is cool as always here.
0.96 	 I guess the best part of the film was the end.
0.97 	 It had some cool action.
0.88 	 What more could anyone want?
0.56 	 He's a history lesson, foreign language tutor, NRA representative and ambassador to Burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels.
0.99 	 I laughed so hard I left a puddle.
0.97 	 I go to the cinema to be entertained.
0.92 	 It is one-paced, with no change of mood.
0.97 	 To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s.
0.72 	 SEE IT!
0.5 	 The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives.
0.96 	 The eye candy is pretty good for both genders.
0.99 	 Camera work is good.
0.8 	 I was surprised by the quality of the film.
0.99 	 almost accidentally.
0.72 	 oh boy!
0.99 	 what a choice.<br /><br />I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show.
0.55 	 Now I can easily say this has been a hell of a ride.
0.63 	 You will drift from thinking "how come the human being can be so vicious" to "why not after all?
0.54 	 ".Ask yourself would you do it.
0.59 	 Then learn about the contestants, their motives and start guessing.
0.71 	 i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him.
0.87 	 The idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it felt like you didn't care about some of the contestants.
0.84 	 Although this might have been done on purpose, i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants.
0.96 	 - game rules, a big glitch :<br /><br />what happens if the 5th contestants doesn't die when he pulls the trigger.
0.5 	 do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself!!!
1.0 	 they should have given a chance to all contestants to live, ie: if 5th is a blank too, then no one dies.<br /><br />interestingly I haven't been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time.
0.89 	 just wish i had some popcorn with me!
0.97 	 Now, Byron was a "my week beats your year" fellow, which makes selecting parts that are representative even harder.
0.99 	 Furthermore, just as Byron's poetry is inseparable from his life, the man's life itself must be seen as a whole.
0.89 	 Lifting parts out is not only not showing the whole picture, it's showing a different picture altogether.<br /><br />Now, in short my review comes down to this: supposedly, Byron was indeed the "my week beats your year" prototype, a guy who lived so intensely that he indeed did more in his 15 or so active years than most do in an entire lifetime.
0.97 	 Well, to over simplify things, a Byron bio should have two distinct episodes: 1.
0.97 	 Post-first Europe trip: England and his rise to fame + marriage / 2.
0.99 	 His life abroad.
0.94 	 Now, the important thing is that the SECOND part should be at least as important as the first.
0.98 	 Not only was it a lot longer, but the most significant change in Byron took place then.
1.0 	 Furthermore, it's where he created his best works (Don Juan, the Vision of Judgement etc.
0.99 	 - all the stuff that makes him *really* unique in English literature).<br /><br />Instead, in this film (a) Byron's life never comes across as even remotely entertaining, (b) it only gets *worse* after he leaves England.
1.0 	 They did two good jobs: first, they started at his return of his Europe trip (though a bit more of the actual trip would have been welcome as a prologue), second, they chose an angle, and they chose his incestuous love for Augusta (who is rather perfectly cast).
0.99 	 True, Byron remained strongly attached to Augusta for the rest of his life, but, especially as he was such a mood swing person, the fact that his letters reflect that does not mean that at other times he might not have completely enjoyed life.<br /><br />Anyway, the first part of the TV film should have ended with him leaving England.
1.0 	 The thing is: once abroad, a life of debauchery began (with the infamous Geneva period), but in Italy Byron also discovered a new life, both for his poetry (inspired by Italian comedy), already in Venice, and for himself when he found the Contessa Teresa Guiccioli and moved to Ravenna (afterwards, at the request of Shelly, with Teresa, to Pisa).
1.0 	 His mind and life opened up (and not only in the decadent sense), while England's closed further as it fell into the gravitational pull of the Victorian age.
0.95 	 True, freedom was Augusta-less, but this bitter-sweet freedom tastes sour in this film.
1.0 	 Apart from poetic and romantic developments, his relationship with Shelly (and the down-break) should have been more documented.
1.0 	 Also, it is in Italy in Ravenna that he gets involved with politics and revolutionary ideas.
1.0 	 This is important, as it shows that the decadent romantic and ultimately escapist language and person of Childe Harold is changing into the more planted-in-life realistic and lighter passion of the language and person of Don Juan.
0.94 	 Life and work are one.
0.61 	 True, still a bit naive, but it's what got him to Greece!
1.0 	 And the whole thing came full circle in Pisa, where Shelley's revolutionary spirit further ignited the spark.
0.99 	 It was the insights in Italy (the Gambas) stirring him into action.
1.0 	 It can be a symbol for the man looking for some ancient-style battle excitement while the rest of Europe becomes fixed in the clay of modern reason and conservatism.
1.0 	 But it wasn't just that, there was a true inspiration behind it.
1.0 	 THAT is the essence of Byron's life: he may have had some strong emotional attachments (2: Augusta and Teresa), but EVERY time he managed to reinvent himself truly.
0.51 	 Why is it that so often the second period in Byron's life is overlooked?
0.99 	 In focusing our attention on the frustrated England years fraught with scandals, we show ourselves to be not much better than the English aristocracy at the time, which Byron so despised, and which, despite the fact that he had no choice, he *willingly* fled in 1816, to find a world that was modern and liberal enough to let him find the voice that would make him the first romantic plainspoken language poet and evolve from a self-obsessed snob to a passionate man moving onward with a cause.
0.97 	 I kept getting a message like "No votes have been placed...." And yet I saw in the stats that there were.
0.64 	 Will try again tomorrow (Monday).<br /><br />Minor flaws I overlooked.
0.83 	 After all, isn't that what it's all about?
0.86 	 Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of sorts.
0.8 	 That's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it.<br /><br />It's not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character.
1.0 	 I did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks.
1.0 	 I was very impressed by the cast's strong acting, particularly David Thelis's; only the character of Jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional.
1.0 	 The photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together.
0.83 	 And they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance.
0.91 	 But still, his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter.
0.69 	 There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of clichÃ©-ridden narration came on.
0.96 	 I did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's tired "concepts" into something watchable.
0.93 	 However, they are not overdone: the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidney's misadventures.
0.95 	 The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately obnoxious skilled writer.
0.97 	 Of course, given that I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you might not find my offer too enticing, but it's there on the table anyway.
0.81 	 It's dated.
0.96 	 But as opera it can't be faulted; and I'm an opera buff.
0.98 	 I can't even detect one lip-sync; if we didn't know that was Tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't Sophia Loren.
1.0 	 Whoever didn't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss.
0.65 	 As the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together.<br /><br />Great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film.
0.79 	 Yes its a sexy vampire story.
0.96 	 To be honest there is a reason that I've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great, but other than that...<br /><br />For those who want to see sexy vampires only.
0.92 	 I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film.
0.97 	 I managed to stomach 45-50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead (which, by the way, is great fun).<br /><br />The story has massive holes in it.
0.98 	 Let's cut to the chase: If you're a baby-boomer, you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that, in 1976, McCartney had the gumption to drop in on John's city hermit life and spend the day with him.
0.61 	 You'll notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and gets to speak, is played by Stephen King.
0.89 	 What are the odds against that?
0.96 	 He's not a knowable character.
0.83 	 ("All I can think about is food," he tells us, helpfully.)
1.0 	 Perhaps he's under some kind of enchantment.
0.99 	 IN FACT..." [big dramatic pause] "...I don't think you'd like it at all."
0.63 	 we have laugh to the deaf.
0.92 	 can u imagine on covers there is nomination for Oscar??
0.99 	 --first, musician have mix about 4-5 different style of music... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves...<br /><br />---main character Silvester do not fit in there.
0.71 	 rope mix 3. a Girl?
0.99 	 the best scene is when she dies.
0.83 	 She means a lot to him.
0.94 	 he knows her for ages?
0.99 	 he cries for her, ... o my god samurai 4. how many arrows is he got?
0.97 	 his arrow bag is always full of the arrows?
0.56 	 after the war?
0.95 	 o my god, u Americans really need to learn about the weapons!
1.0 	 I was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov.
0.67 	 My disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film doesn't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film.
0.93 	 Ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large American corporation based in London.
0.99 	 His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid.
0.86 	 I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too together here, too composed, the part called for more of a wacky, physical comedian.
1.0 	 Bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late, late, late show viewers.
0.77 	 Space explorers on the planet Mars fight off strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other strange creatures.
0.97 	 Pretty cool.<br /><br />The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen.
1.0 	 Get comfy and enjoy.
0.93 	 I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss.
1.0 	 It won't be easy for Tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend, William Forsythe, isn't about to give her up without a fight.<br /><br />You see Tylo and Forsythe are two of business executive Arthur Roberts' employees, brilliant minds who meet Combs(..a scientist who once worked for Roberts, and whose vacated position went to Tylo)at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments.
1.0 	 This island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and "son".
1.0 	 Tylo was dating Combs' son, hence the connection besides the two having worked for Roberts, who brings along his trophy wife, Mariya Ignatova.
1.0 	 Also accompanying Tylo and Forsythe, Roberts and Ignatova, are their colleagues, Elise Muller and GR Johnson.
0.63 	 The monster itself is never seen in it's entirety, just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror.
0.81 	 A constant is while(..and after)victims are attacked, we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the water's surface(..this is really director Michael Oblowitz's main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners).<br /><br />Combs doesn't break new ground as the scientist, but he's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold-blooded resolve.
1.0 	 It's fun seeing Forsythe in a rare clean-cut hero role, very against type as an electronics wiz(..to his credit, he actually pulls it off)who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril.
1.0 	 Tylo is also in a very different kind of role, a scientist who can defend herself quite well.
1.0 	 Roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep, and it's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at Combs' soldiers(..although, his fate is not pleasant).
0.96 	 Mentioning that, it was also really entertaining watching Forythe and Tylo downing Combs' hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns.
1.0 	 Beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop.
0.98 	 When Emy fails to hear from George for a lengthy amount of time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute.
0.91 	 While director/co-writer Bitto Albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex, this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze.
1.0 	 Granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too silly or trashy.
1.0 	 My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile.
0.59 	 First, Phillippe (I forget what his character is called and I don't really care) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the top-security terminals.
0.96 	 Anyway, this movie is a good laugh.
0.99 	 If you need something to make fun of, definitely see it.
0.98 	 TV does influence society...just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted.
0.99 	 Besides, real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems.<br /><br />Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living?
0.86 	 I know a person who makes $100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $2200 a month in rent.
0.58 	 When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what a funny movie.
0.98 	 Production values are somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'.
0.72 	 At the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young.
0.84 	 A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on Sci Fi channel.
0.95 	 While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well.
0.59 	 At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation.
0.91 	 There's also a side effect too.
0.52 	 I am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made.
0.9 	 The debate over global warming is far from over, and will only be over when the eco-zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory.
0.76 	 Wake up people.
0.81 	 Don't just read articles that support your present opinions, read everything you can find.
0.64 	 I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the movie for me.
0.5 	 But, don't expect it to be as good as the original.
0.52 	 i saw a clip from it on YouTube, and i vowed that should it ever show on TV, i would glue myself to the set in order to watch.
0.97 	 Please be tolerant of other people's opinion.
0.86 	 Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment completely.<br /><br />I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.<br /><br />Subject: one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions.
1.0 	 One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker.
0.94 	 So making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with, or preferably, don't do at all.
0.92 	 Wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know.
0.96 	 One might think this is not a review of the movie itself, but the movie is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow.
0.9 	 If someone tells a story about a tomato, i can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, the tomato.
1.0 	 Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies.
0.93 	 "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety", and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre.
0.99 	 There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this film has going for it.
0.99 	 There is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house.
0.98 	 But don't let the `horror' label scare you off, if you're not a fan of the genre.
0.73 	 I wish that today's Hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like Siu-Tung Ching rather falling back on the usual MTV video or Pepsi commercial `directors'.
0.99 	 In fact, most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films.<br /><br />Since its release, "A Chinese Ghost Story" has spawned two worthy sequels, a full-length animated movie, and countless imitations.
0.97 	 I really looked forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters.
1.0 	 I don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level.
0.68 	 The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago.
0.96 	 And it didn't stay in production very long.<br /><br />There was a movie that came out during this time period called "Blue Thunder" that was much more realistic.
0.96 	 How much could the general Hollywood director learn from this movie?
0.81 	 All... when it comes to actually scaring people.
0.95 	 I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention.
0.94 	 It really portrayed the black music scene back then.
0.71 	 However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits.
0.6 	 The singing just kept coming, one after the other.
1.0 	 This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion).
0.91 	 Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.
0.81 	 I really don't get all the adulation that this film has received.
0.97 	 That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance?
0.57 	 Tim Meadows does his best but the plot just doesn't have many high points.
0.79 	 Will Farrell has a bit part.
0.83 	 Farrell may be the funniest man alive... but not in this movie.
0.54 	 Sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie, and it works on some level.
0.85 	 But the new characters are just not interesting.
0.91 	 A syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests.
0.94 	 All too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed.
1.0 	 The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies.
0.74 	 This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception.
0.55 	 Its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans.
0.96 	 After all, we do like these creatures and these films after all, don't we?
0.97 	 The old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander.
0.51 	 That day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown.
0.75 	 "Liam" on the other hand is just strange.
0.57 	 I must give credit to "Liam" for one thing, and that is making it clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
0.51 	 The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys.
0.96 	 Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer.
0.83 	 She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise!
0.71 	 Advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin "pursue your dream" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!<br /><br />And finally, the music.
0.77 	 Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened.
0.93 	 But the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet.
0.89 	 It seems a vampire is loose in a small German town draining its victims of their blood.
0.97 	 Police Inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok.
0.55 	 So try to see the this version if possible.
0.97 	 This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place.
1.0 	 The first was the killer's mask - which was nice.
0.98 	 The plot is an amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks.
0.91 	 The martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent.
0.66 	 I watched this because I thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at.
0.64 	 This movie is very boring.<br /><br />The movie starts out Kip Raines(Giovanni Ribisi) sitting outside a Porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car.
0.74 	 When they confirm it's the right one, Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window, shattering it.
0.99 	 He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys.
0.98 	 Then, we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines.
0.59 	 He is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go-kart track.
0.8 	 Then, he is confronted by Atlee Jackson(Will Patton).
0.99 	 Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in deep *bleep*.
0.98 	 Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles.
0.95 	 Memphis heads to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri(Christopher Ecclesten).
0.86 	 So, where are the other 40 cars?
0.81 	 The Dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well.
0.82 	 But, right when Nicholas Cage starts the engine up again, the police officer jerks his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately begins to chase after him.
0.71 	 How does he know it's the right car?
0.75 	 There are very few cars.
0.99 	 Sarah Silverman is really the "flavor of the month" comic right now.
0.62 	 She is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny).
0.95 	 She is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit.
0.91 	 But if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her.
0.98 	 She reminds me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, even though neither of them are really "hot" now in terms of popularity.
1.0 	 When it works, it's hilarious.
1.0 	 The AIDS episode here is the best one.
1.0 	 It's consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it.
0.99 	 But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome.
0.98 	 When the jokes hit, they're brilliant.
0.95 	 So should you watch this show?
0.87 	 You can gaze at her and pretend she's yours.
0.64 	 As for her show, it's ranges from good to absolute zero.
0.97 	 The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film.
0.94 	 I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me.
0.96 	 I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor.
0.99 	 I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it.
0.96 	 I was told, too late.
0.96 	 So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off.
0.99 	 I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay.
0.84 	 and this movie has crossed it.
0.51 	 A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible?
0.76 	 The film crams Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position.
0.92 	 Made in the late '80s and released in 1990, this was cutting edge stuff for the day.
0.81 	 There were some strange sequences in which odd-looking men- creatures would dance around with birds overheard.
1.0 	 The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless.
0.62 	 Or rather they are part of the fun, and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked -- WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSON'S MOVIE SUCKED.
0.95 	 <br /><br />He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators, and with all it's faults + clunkiness, Kramer's YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this, which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages, not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space.
0.98 	 Because the movie looks so "fake" you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked, trampled, tossed about and smashed.
0.64 	 While the latter lays a trap for him, Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter (Barbara Hershey).
0.95 	 Naturally, the former lawman â accompanied by Hersheyâs greenhorn fiancÃ© (Chris Mitchum) â sets out in pursuit of Coburn and his followers, all of whom broke jail along with him.<br /><br />Rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-Fordian style, McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach â with which heâs never fully at ease: repellent characters, plenty of violence, and the sexual tension generated by Hersheyâs presence among Coburnâs lusty bunch.
0.97 	 Incidentally, Heston and Coburn had previously appeared together in a Sam Peckinpah Western â the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE (1965; I really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on DVD, though I recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off TCM UK).
0.8 	 Anyway, the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for (suggested also by the title): then again, both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most American of genres â WILL PENNY (1968) for Heston and Coburn with PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID (1973)!
0.98 	 <br /><br />At least, though, Heston maintains a modicum of dignity here â his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed Coburn by anticipating what his next move will be; the latter, however, tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax (relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing Heston to witness his associatesâ gang-rape of Hershey).
0.97 	 â as the youngest member of Coburnâs gang whoâs assigned the task of watching over Hershey (while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away!).
0.97 	 Jerry Goldsmith contributes a flavorful but, at the same time, unremarkable score.
0.99 	 A cast of 1980's TV movie and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models.
1.0 	 This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax.
0.83 	 Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called "so bad, they're good" movies.
0.56 	 ).<br /><br />The characters in this movie are not likable at all.
0.85 	 No one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched.
0.78 	 As in other straight-to-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all.
0.91 	 There are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight.
1.0 	 In fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place.
0.63 	 The dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger.
0.58 	 This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH).
0.89 	 But, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.<br /><br />Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie.
0.99 	 And fans of the classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it!
0.85 	 Naturally sweet - no added sugar.<br /><br />One small point: it seems to me that the mild objections raised about Ustinov's character Pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius/savant at this sort of thing.
0.97 	 Yes, the film was pretty computer illiterate, but it did show Pendelton 'studying computers' at his flat, and I believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject, practically overnight.<br /><br />There were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff.
0.86 	 Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at, it's necessary to know quite what their concept was.
0.96 	 They knew there was something about 'procedures' which was important; they thought that the 'smart light' could actually control security, rather than just indicate its state; they thought that the (dumb) user terminal's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though apart from things like graphics feature I don't see it meself.<br /><br />Mostly, I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could, and they did that rather well.
0.53 	 "Women?
0.85 	 This lags behind the previous year's "Dad's Army", entirely missing the special, small-screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original, and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen... you could just about say that this film well represents a Britain entering decline, and more precisely even than that, a *British film industry* entering decline.
0.53 	 What would Anthony Aloysius Hancock have made of it all...?
0.6 	 This movie is probably for you.
0.89 	 However, what I did not understand, confused, and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing (I saw over an hour of it) was the redundancy of the whole thing.
0.65 	 You only find out bits and pieces of why he's commissioned, and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work.
0.75 	 I generally LIKE watching Burt Lancaster's films--especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in Elmer Gantry.
0.91 	 However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed ANYTHING.
1.0 	 Although I am generally a proponent of the well-made film, I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries, and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully "break the rules."
0.94 	 And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema.
0.99 	 This is true of DECAMERON.
0.99 	 Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable result, under Pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors.
0.99 	 This is also true of DECAMERON.
0.77 	 Such elements can often be used with startling effect, but in Pasolini's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film.
1.0 	 This is also true of DECAMERON.<br /><br />I have been given to understand there are many people who like, even admire Pasolini's films.
0.83 	 Even so, I have never actually met any of them, and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me.
0.8 	 And this, too, is true of DECAMERON.
0.57 	 It is also, sadly, true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure.
0.7 	 I just watched this movie in high definition on television.
1.0 	 I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating.
1.0 	 His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great.
1.0 	 HE was a great man.
0.64 	 Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan's dream come true.
0.81 	 At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life.
0.96 	 It seems like a winning situation.
1.0 	 While it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project.
0.98 	 But then we start seeing new footage (alternates from Superman - The Movie for the trial) and that first bit of hesitation fades away.
1.0 	 Hey, this is pretty neat!
0.81 	 And from this point on, it never ever lets up.
0.98 	 The best effects in this are from the original productions.<br /><br />Another issue with this re-cut.
0.81 	 Lester's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly.
1.0 	 The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II.
0.79 	 While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.<br /><br />So is there anything good in this release?
1.0 	 Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that's neat to see.
0.99 	 In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman - The Movie.
0.96 	 But that only highlights the problems of this release.
0.94 	 Any of the major scenes (really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando) would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section.
0.99 	 Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper's back as he calls for Lois and Clark?
0.53 	 As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation "XK 10" while we all know it's the "XK 101"!
0.93 	 A blind man in STM knows that!
0.96 	 As it is, we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a "Play All" option.
1.0 	 It's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else.
0.99 	 I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lester's version.
1.0 	 He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new re-cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.
0.99 	 You know all those letters to "Father Christmas" and "Jesus" that are sent every year?
1.0 	 As bizarre settings go, it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is "Dead Letter Office".
0.94 	 Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one.
0.92 	 If it was Royal Mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway.
0.86 	 Writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another.
0.95 	 and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez (George Del Hoyo).
0.98 	 Slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?<br /><br />Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god-awful Heather Graham film "Committed" while watching this.
1.0 	 It is also well acted.
1.0 	 Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best.
0.6 	 ), such a story is unlikely to take place in reality.
0.58 	 The other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.<br /><br />Despite that, "Dead Letter Office" is certainly something a little different.
0.97 	 It might not be to everyone's taste but I liked it.
0.86 	 There ain't any major laughs, there's no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional.
1.0 	 But it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth-shattering in its magnificence, it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time.
0.95 	 It's the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there.
0.64 	 To think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals, snakes and other reptiles, the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects.
0.99 	 Towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils.
0.82 	 Movies like this aren't made much those days.
0.68 	 I will still see it again and I know I will never tire of it!
0.87 	 To think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable!
0.57 	 Margret Laurence probably didn't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film, let alone the Stone Angel.
0.87 	 Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dare, anyone?
0.89 	 ), and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process.
0.85 	 The symbols in the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc, etc.)
0.93 	 ), I think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film.
0.53 	 Hagar's defiance (for the sake of defiance) was not there.
0.97 	 It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable.
0.88 	 Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums?
0.97 	 I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at, or with, Hagar.
0.88 	 These people are frustrated and are full of angst, and all we do is to laugh at them.
0.83 	 I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.
1.0 	 I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed.
0.97 	 Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age.
0.95 	 Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients.
0.5 	 Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood.
0.65 	 MURDER!!
0.51 	 MUTILATION!!
0.51 	 FANATICISM!!
0.85 	 ANIMAL CRUELTY!!
0.83 	 BETRAYAL!!
0.64 	 <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable.
0.99 	 If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy.
0.58 	 From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge.
0.72 	 Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only similarity it bears to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (albeit an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!
0.99 	 ), and has some characters with the same names.<br /><br />Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to seek treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up precisely where the treasure is, purely by chance.
0.87 	 Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand made-for-TV movies are some examples of this.
0.69 	 But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything by the book.
0.58 	 But soon enough, the cops wants Carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife.
0.8 	 The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end.
1.0 	 The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes.
0.97 	 They would way, way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation.
0.94 	 There is (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes such as sex or people dying, and kids accept Jimmy's schemes.
0.95 	 I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc.
0.98 	 There have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of Hollywood.
0.98 	 Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947).
1.0 	 Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late '30s-early '40s.
0.56 	 Jordan."
0.98 	 These were well-written, funny, entertaining comedies, all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels.<br /><br />Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell, making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable, bitchy young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell) who is falling for Kate's fiancÃ©, Henry (Paul Rudd).
0.98 	 One thing that is clear at the outset: Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two "Topper" films), who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured.<br /><br />There is a line right at the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, "You don't smile."
1.0 	 She's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her (well, she actually just fades out), so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is.<br /><br />Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so she introduces him to Ashley, who really doesn't know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she is also a cateress to make ends meet), to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate.
0.99 	 Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women, he deserves whatever he gets.<br /><br />Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin.
1.0 	 As it is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray, and Co. must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two "Topper" films has wrought.
0.89 	 I headed up with about 150 people to St. George and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the St. George temple.. Not one person had dry eyes in the audience.
0.94 	 I ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off.
0.53 	 Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila.
0.93 	 she is like u have never seen before.
0.98 	 she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family.
0.99 	 from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next?
0.93 	 You do realize that you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right?
1.0 	 But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat.
0.99 	 And the best part?
0.99 	 Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!
0.95 	 This opinion, however, does not resemble Neorealist movies, in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti.
0.86 	 Does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession?
0.83 	 "Isn't it what we both wanted" says one of the couple... it occurs that it's not.
0.84 	 They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots.
0.83 	 His desires show him totally different direction... Do viewers remain indifferent at Gino-Giovanna's first meeting?
0.85 	 In such case, his films would only entertain (which is, of course, not entirely Fellini's style, too).
0.68 	 Visconti always had something to convey.
0.77 	 What did he want to say here?
1.0 	 Is the film against bad marriage?
1.0 	 i was intrigued to see how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker.
0.92 	 sadly, all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off-the-screen reasons.<br /><br />the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see.
0.75 	 The widow dies and Arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities, which may haunt him for some days.
0.89 	 The film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in Arthurs shoes, and his efforts to shake this ghost off.
0.98 	 And the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things I've seen, one I don't wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives.
0.75 	 This is really the only reason I could leave the television on - morbid fascination.
0.96 	 Don't even ask me about the score...the only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba.
1.0 	 I'll start with what I liked.<br /><br />I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :) ), choreography, everything.<br /><br />I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene.<br /><br />But that's about it.<br /><br />I get it, arty cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much.
0.96 	 "John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama!
0.81 	 ).<br /><br />I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film (and all power to them), but they're really better off sticking with Hughes Sr.'s high school output, and if the idea of school-time rebellion is what really appeals, the 1968 classic "If..." is a much more satisfying examination of the subject.
0.81 	 Hard to tell.
0.79 	 Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life?
0.7 	 Why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle?
1.0 	 Off the top of my head I can only think of AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN getting a lot of critical acclaim .
0.68 	 <br /><br />CRIMSON TIDE too received some begrudging acclaim from critics , it`s certainly one of Bruckheimer`s better films which alas isn`t saying much .
0.73 	 or that the expositional newsreel consists of familar footage featuring conflicts from the Balkans , the first gulf war and even Vietnam .
0.88 	 Cool!
0.92 	 Keep expectations low and it might work for you.
0.7 	 I frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market, and sadly White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor.
0.98 	 I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief.
0.9 	 Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton, I was totally unaffected by his demise.
1.0 	 Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton's abodes.
0.95 	 Nothing compared to Boogie Nights which was kind of slow.
0.82 	 Wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around.
0.66 	 I didn't approach "Still Crazy" with any real anticipation.
0.96 	 This film is partially that, but so much more.
0.99 	 At the center of this bloodbath was no other than `Johnny Wad' himself.
0.94 	 Daddy ding-dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine.
0.79 	 Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes, just like Holmes' famous organ.
0.6 	 He died of complications from the Aids virus.
0.91 	 Oops!
0.56 	 Wrong Holmes movie!
0.68 	 Ok!
0.96 	 That is enough before I get `penislized' I mean penalized.
0.92 	 The British Public School system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconception.It was designed to produce administrators and governors,civil servants and military men to run the British Colonies.These people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes.When the Public Schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the case.They tended to favour the schools nearer "Town" so Eton and Harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent.
0.97 	 The vast majority of Public Schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale.Tom Brown,perhaps the most famous Public School pupil ever,was the son of a country parson,not a belted earl.
0.98 	 Thus in late 1960s England,a country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as Harold Wilson could slip off his "Gannex" mac,Lindsay Anderson's "If" was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else.
0.91 	 So when Mr Anderson's film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as Mr Malcolm McDowell's glorious victory over an amorphous "Them" despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end,a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the U.S.Embassy.
1.0 	 Following the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in New York.
0.86 	 Unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story, it's over in too many cases.
0.99 	 And, the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together.
0.99 	 Now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists!
1.0 	 This is all so sad because I had loved the first film so much--and I really WANTED to love this film.
0.86 	 For a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.<br /><br />Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film.
0.91 	 I went to this movie expecting to view a typical "family" movie, one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor.
1.0 	 Most are cheaply made, written and produced purely to attract young family members, who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots.<br /><br />Oh yes, Paulie had a plot.
0.78 	 Seriously.
0.94 	 No sleeping.
0.99 	 I attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations: <br /><br />1.
0.57 	 When "Dixie" shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about.<br /><br />2.
1.0 	 Toby was dark and brooding most of the film, but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming.
0.64 	 <br /><br />4.
1.0 	 If you're a Toby fan you'll love the songs.
1.0 	 For instance, the movie's official love song is "Crash Here Tonight".
0.94 	 You'd think that would play around a tender love scene, but nope...we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a memorial service.
0.68 	 It was as if they said "well, we gotta use this song somewhere".
0.93 	 I like Toby and really wanted to like "Broken Bridges" but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where.
0.99 	 When you look at this now and hear all the language in here, it's amazing this was rated "PG," but that's the 1970s rating system for you.
0.99 	 For those who loved Falk in TV's "Columbo" it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films.
0.6 	 This is far from the only case.
0.91 	 <br /><br />Thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft, yet somehow still fetching, curator Jenny.
0.78 	 "Hardgore" is a prime example of totally demented 70's smut, as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration.
0.61 	 All the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production, writing and character development.
0.75 	 From here on, better or worse, the series would also deal with one essential theme: a scientist (usually Bela) makes experiments in the basement or the old house (sometimes IN the basement in the old house) that causes things to go blooey.
0.89 	 The plot?
0.97 	 They both like to sleep in coffins.
0.97 	 Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband.
0.78 	 Is this the only role she knows how to play?
0.94 	 I wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well.
0.92 	 You'll laugh at Alienator, but AT it, not with it.
0.93 	 If that's your thing then go ahead and check it out.
0.77 	 I can't believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope its not the end, I cant wait to see the next episode...
0.53 	 The gags on this one aren't all madcap Avery style, but more subtle and aimed at anyone who's ever stayed up late watching scary movies (or radio programs)!
0.79 	 The nine-lives gag is well done here, and I don't know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when I was a kid.
0.54 	 Get your pause button ready, it's worth it!
0.92 	 She clearly has not learned her craft.
0.95 	 All the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their Sunday best.
0.93 	 Turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on.
0.67 	 I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult I found this a thoroughly moving film.<br /><br />
0.92 	 This movie had me laughing and crying.
0.86 	 I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago.
0.64 	 They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD.
0.92 	 I liked IQ.
0.95 	 I agree with animaster, they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure.
0.97 	 I recommend it to families and kids.
0.54 	 It's not like anyone else is interested.
0.96 	 She goes to see the killer's sister & mom.
0.93 	 What's the motivation?
0.71 	 Of course, it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested.
0.98 	 Yeah, the one who lives in the White House.
0.5 	 Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent.<br /><br />Is that the spoiler?<br /><br />It should be.
0.58 	 The spoiler is that his wife did it!
0.89 	 Yeah... the First Lady.
0.51 	 And she gets away with it.
0.63 	 After all, only one reporter is even interested.
0.73 	 <br /><br />I give this move a "1".
0.93 	 That's the real spoiler!
0.86 	 no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed.
0.72 	 Eli Roth does shine for moments of maybe ten, putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption.
0.97 	 I saw The Matrix and was amazed.
1.0 	 It was the most spectacular movie ever made.
0.63 	 God knows what his performance is like in Something's Gotta Give!
0.72 	 In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy, but I can see why she does go crazy.
0.86 	 If I lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has I would go crazy too.
0.67 	 Everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it.
0.95 	 She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the sharpest knifes in the drawer.<br /><br />To start with the one person closest to her in her life, her husband, Nick, is a little off his rocker.
0.89 	 The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support.
0.99 	 When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act, instead of comforting her, he just yells at her and tells her what to do.<br /><br />The other major people in her life are her parents.
0.94 	 Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her.
0.78 	 The only person that tries to do something for her is Nick's mom.
0.99 	 Nick's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed.
0.74 	 She doesn't want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her.
0.86 	 It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore.
0.95 	 It's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through.
0.5 	 Denial, lost, anger, faith, pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses, and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience.<br /><br />The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience (the woman wears the mask of tragedy, the man represents the comical interludes) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you.
0.96 	 The only thing that "Secret Sunshine" forgets, as "The host" forgot to be scary, is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama, but good point for a good film.
0.97 	 People looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of "Friday the 13th: the Series" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror.
0.7 	 The white families rooms are private and off limits to all except ProtÃ©e who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors, exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family's gazes.
0.99 	 When a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains, the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located.
0.97 	 There are no victims or oppressors, no simplistic good guys.
0.6 	 There is one great moment in *Surviving Christmas* that almost makes it worth the pain: James Gandolfini cracks a shovel over Ben Affleck's stupid head.<br /><br />This movie serves as yet another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini proving what a great actor he is whilst simultaneously besmirching his career by acting in this film.<br /><br />Young and wealthy ad exec, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has been inculcated into believing that one must never be alone on Christmas.
0.82 	 Storyline finds Drew buying off a family to spend Christmas with, on the condition that they pretend to be his own, insensately ignoring all the indications to the contrary that his money has not bought the emotions he was seeking.<br /><br />For $250,000, a surly suburban truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to be Drew's ad hoc family, against protests from their son, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (a very soft-focused Christina Applegate).
0.91 	 Fraught with overt psychoses, Drew plasters a fake smile on his face and blindly remains in denial against every denigration that he was supposedly buying the Valco family to avoid.<br /><br />Which begs the question: If Drew is paying these people to recapture some semblance of joyous familial emotion, how psychotic must he be to pretend happiness amongst their barbs and mental anguish over his presence?
0.98 	 Is he so incognizant that he cannot see that his money is not buying him the "family" atmosphere he was inculcated into believing was a truth in the first place?
0.99 	 As sick and disgusting as this movie is, it really is a comedy and not a "horror" movie at all.
0.99 	 This movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole (with a condom on the end).
1.0 	 If you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it.<br /><br />I have seen stacks of terrible, boring, z-grade, Indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R.
1.0 	 I have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars.
0.91 	 I don't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two.
0.94 	 Before I start, I should point out that I know the editor of this film.
0.76 	 Anyway...<br /><br />Somehow, it's ironic how while the "Rat Pack" culture of the late 50's and early to mid-60's made a comeback in the mid-90's, this movie, from the son of one of the original Rat Pack, and which was made in a similar fashion, was a flop.
0.88 	 And while Ellen Barkin is only required to vamp in this movie, she does it entertainingly.
0.98 	 And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here.
1.0 	 First of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic Gregory's Girl and Local Hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated.
0.99 	 Schoolboy Gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen, he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing Dorothy.
0.91 	 Although now thirty five, Gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing Frances, also sixteen, despite the fact that music teacher, Bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him.
1.0 	 His passion for Frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend.
0.9 	 The main problem lies with the character of Gregory himself, in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old Gregory who actively and comically pursues Dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over.
0.98 	 Why does he never see his father, who is clearly still alive?
0.96 	 Why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended?
0.89 	 Why is he so interested in Noam Chomsky and injustice?
0.97 	 Why is he attracted to Frances?
0.68 	 What in heaven's name do Bel or Frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting?
0.98 	 It's hard to know what was going through Bill Forsyth's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm, wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic.
0.97 	 I can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all.That at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent.
0.95 	 I liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end.
0.87 	 But Dark Floors takes the "what is this movie about?"
0.51 	 What IS this movie about?<br /><br />This isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and/or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
0.61 	 House hires some guy and de-physicalizes Tritter.
0.6 	 In real life, Tritter would have been hauled up for harassment, the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court, providing motive and opportunity and the hospitals lawyers would have made mincemeat out of Tritter and the particular department he worked for.
1.0 	 The lawsuit would have won House a tasty settlement, enough to keep him supplied with Vicadin well into his old age.
0.61 	 While Tritter would wind up somewhere driving a cab, trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good for people for two years before people tumbled to the fact that they'd seen it all before.
0.95 	 It did not, however, remain at its original location in the Argonne forest.
0.7 	 When Zinn described a heavy-water reactor operating at one-tenth the power of the Materials Testing Reactor under design at Oak Ridge, Weinberg joked it would be simpler if Zinn took the Oak Ridge design and operated the Materials Testing Reactor at one-tenth capacity.
0.99 	 The joke proved unintentionally prophetic.
0.63 	 "<br /><br />The S-50 plant used convection to separate the isotopes in thousands of tall columns.
0.56 	 If Royalty knew of these necessary precautions to citizen welfare then what was the necessity of the warfare WWI and WWII.
0.9 	 Because supposedly their were no survivors, and the ones who were caught in Europe ordered to be executed.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The FÃ¼hrer No.
0.64 	 OKW/WFSt, FÃ¼hrer HQ, 18 Oct. 1942, (signed) Adolph Hitler; Translation of Document no.
0.99 	 I'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!)
0.51 	 for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie I've ever seen!<br /><br />I have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings)... the only thing I can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions:<br /><br />1.
0.94 	 Even when trying to warn people about something, they just laugh at him.
0.55 	 The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part: his left foot.
0.99 	 He uses that appendage to paint and write poetry, bringing him to prominence.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well on this collaboration, and also on a later collaboration: "In the Name of the Father" (but "The Boxer" was unnecessary).
1.0 	 In the hands of lesser actors than Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan this film could have become silly and trite.
0.52 	 When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married, and that he was best man at that wedding, one can sense that there is some sort of plot against her at work.
0.58 	 As Colbert, Ryan, and her attorney set out to disprove the strangers claim of a prior marriage, they are met at every turn by more evidence that seems to reinforce the claim that she is indeed already wed.
0.93 	 OK me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves.
0.7 	 Right?
0.65 	 x 1000!!!
0.74 	 ), the characters were.. well, they really lacked any kind of personality...
0.51 	 The effects were terrible.. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing.. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff?
0.99 	 great!
0.57 	 oh.. they're kissing... again... and now for the violence!
0.88 	 Cool!
0.99 	 Making cool movies is easy!It could have been so great...
0.51 	 !
0.85 	 Laurence Fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad.
0.8 	 Cassio's slaying, for instance, was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart, causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all.<br /><br />Did I mention Michael Maloney?
0.97 	 His madness striken Roderigo was unusual; annoying even.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Othello before, see this.
0.92 	 If you haven't read Othello, see this.
0.73 	 If you haven't heard Othello, see this.
0.99 	 It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football.
0.55 	 Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick.
0.85 	 Even if you don't like football, go see this film.
0.66 	 Gary Busey kicks their butts, of course.
0.88 	 When seeing this movie you should take notice to that itÂ´s not a normal movie.
0.91 	 For this movie, that's witty.
0.98 	 Life is hard in the Depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity.
0.97 	 That is true, but this is mostly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like Batman Forever with it's direction style and weird character designs.
1.0 	 Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he's given the case to work on, but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg).
0.99 	 When the futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor.
0.73 	 In any non-action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome.
0.55 	 This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
0.61 	 A dinosaur and detective solve the murder, a toon and detective solve the murder.
0.79 	 The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs.
0.5 	 serious.
0.52 	 it's 3.30 am in the morning.
1.0 	 I am proud that i survived after all of it!
0.88 	 Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night!!
1.0 	 RUBBISH MOVIE.<br /><br />Happy Republic day to one and all :)
0.9 	 <br /><br />The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to defect to Sweden.
0.89 	 But his plans are ruined by the Russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in Sweden.
0.76 	 But besides this?
1.0 	 People running around in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow.<br /><br />What really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed.
1.0 	 It's so bad i lack the words to describe it.
0.93 	 And of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special-effects budget consisting of four food-stamps and a McDonald's voucher.<br /><br />So what's the verdict?
0.97 	 Never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol.
0.93 	 For a moment I almost believed the Gang would win the battle at Glenrowan, alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this.
0.99 	 (And hey, I'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned...)
0.97 	 would be going through your mind quite a lot.
0.59 	 What's the odds?)
0.99 	 Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away.
0.99 	 Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created.
0.96 	 The leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being VÃ­ctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing.
1.0 	 They had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect.
1.0 	 The only thing that The First Power really has going for it is that it affords Jeff Kober an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he's done so well in the last 25 years.
0.99 	 Even after Kober is given the gas chamber, his spirit comes back in all kinds of guises.<br /><br />Mykelti Williamson is on hand as Lou's partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as a psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights are around to help Lou.
0.77 	 But if you HAVE to rate it, you should give it a 10.
0.76 	 Following a car accident, a mad scientist(Jason Evers) keeps the head of his fiancee(Virgina Leith)alive.
0.93 	 He then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again.
0.99 	 Also in the cast are: Leslie Daniels, Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton.
1.0 	 A memorable line from a short lived show.
0.57 	 After viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense.
0.83 	 Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter back said FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad responded YOU BET!
0.99 	 A fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show.
1.0 	 Using this line added a unique element to our season that I'll never forget.
1.0 	 We had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line.
0.6 	 How else would you explain special effects pre-dating "An American Werewolf in London," disco still being considered cool, and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States?
0.52 	 While we're at it, let's not overlook those 1970's hairstyles in the 1950's and '60's.
0.83 	 I've seen more of that here than in "Happy Days" & "Laverne & Shirley" combined.<br /><br />The one woman who elevates this movie to the "so bad, it's good" category was the late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but just barely.
0.95 	 Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being churned out by Hollywood today, but even as a "hot chick" she retains her mousey qualities.
0.5 	 Her call for help is evidence of this.
0.66 	 Was the basic idea to show that French film makers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include "Seven" and "Silence of the lambs" ?
0.7 	 Strange.
0.57 	 Why was it X rated?
0.94 	 Let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!!
0.83 	 Paul Verhoeven made this after "Spetters".
1.0 	 "Spetters" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash.
0.97 	 Years ago, I found a "bargain bin" copy of this film for a buck or two.
0.94 	 He played Renfield in Dracula, and here he is very, very similar--though he plays a much more harmless weirdo.
0.99 	 In this case, he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths.
0.95 	 As a result, the film looks pretty good overall, though I also thought that, as usual, Fay Wray was terrible--thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film.
0.72 	 For people who are NOT fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skip-able.
0.99 	 WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS<br /><br />There's a parallel universe out there where Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, edgy, controversial independent movie.
0.5 	 This crew consists of the guy with the funny-shaped ears who's rumoured to be the new Superman; a guy who conducted electricity in The X-Files; an ex-professional footballer and two token black men.<br /><br />Their enemies are cops, rival car thieves and Bilborough from Cracker, his Manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for American audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since Daphne in Frasier.
0.55 	 It's no spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous Paul Gasgoine "hand ball" manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent) only gets one line; not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the film's dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny.
0.99 	 After he struggles through it in his "not-quite-acting-but-it'll-do" London drawl, Cage quips "I always thought you were from Long Island".
0.53 	 My ribs, as you might imagine, were well and truly tickled.<br /><br />In fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect, from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters.
0.75 	 The younger man, who, like the elder, jive-talks for the whole duration, proclaims: "us black people don't like the cold ... we're tropical people".
0.98 	 He then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch Roots.
0.84 	 His older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself, and thereby his colour, in third person.
0.51 	 Thought not.<br /><br />The film's soundtrack is played almost non-stop and with increasing volume, some of the tracks - especially Apollo 440's "Don't Stop The Rock" - so loud they're actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue.
0.99 	 The surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together.
0.97 	 "Keep that music down, young man!
0.58 	 "<br /><br />This isn't the worst film in the world and in many ways I enjoyed it.
0.99 	 Gruveyman2 (comment below)you are a complete idiot...blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to.
0.77 	 Its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about SF, that makes you seem like such the typical LA A**hole!
0.75 	 Of course you don't know it because you are so LA jaded.
0.95 	 The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA, was about the studio executives.
0.77 	 So why wouldn't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system?
0.78 	 How is he not to be considered that?
0.89 	 Coppola did.
0.82 	 He admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie....so what's your point?
0.58 	 "<br /><br />How the hell can "bitchy-ness" and "self-congratulation" suddenly have an "air" of self respect and credence....if they never go to LA again?
1.0 	 What a stupid and senseless comment!
0.87 	 You inserted some big words in there....and just don't know how to use them!
0.75 	 So if they go to LA or New York they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in SF?
0.91 	 For you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city (not the movie!
0.89 	 THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENTARY...VERY INTERESTING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FROM THE BAY AREA...BUT I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
0.56 	 This is easily one of the worst martial arts films I've ever seen, and that's saying something.
0.99 	 The basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into Japan and one man vowels to stop them, of course that's our man Sonny Chiba.
0.99 	 The Karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords.
0.99 	 A woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard, but what are her true intentions?
0.61 	 Sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills, end of story.
0.98 	 Congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever.<br /><br />As stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films I have ever seen.
1.0 	 That's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it's beyond funny.
0.58 	 I bet.
1.0 	 This was the 70's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight, but Chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie.
0.79 	 One part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture.
0.58 	 That doesn't mean that it's not entertaining.
1.0 	 This was an old favorite watch with my best friend.
0.54 	 This movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world.
0.55 	 I wish the girls had been abused more in the prison, as another commenter has suggested, as I've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal.
0.8 	 I had no idea it was part of a larger series.
0.7 	 I must have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV.
0.74 	 If anyone of you would like to contact me, I think you can do that through the IMDb site feel free.
0.53 	 The only reason I'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-the-box.
0.77 	 I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Che's death; for me, it clouded the entire movie.
0.99 	 Part Two was so downbeat compared to, again an inevitability but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative.
0.63 	 The politics of the movement in Bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically.
0.97 	 I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried.
0.6 	 I guess it is all in the timing; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement; in Bolivia there wasn't.
0.98 	 Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the film: If not now, when, 50 years from now.
0.74 	 This makes the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I'm increasingly not liking his style.
1.0 	 He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about.
0.98 	 It's never really a direct caricaturation of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, "But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!
0.8 	 ", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their back.<br /><br />This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation... a man who studies African hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer.
0.73 	 Except of course Morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them "obsessions") making synthetic designs on life.
0.99 	 I share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the film.<br /><br />But I stress his subtlety.
0.91 	 Considering none of this films I've seen so far have particularly impressed me, I don't really care to find out what he's trying to do.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0.78 	 There are laughs in this film, that is for sure.
0.94 	 Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor).
0.98 	 Oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
0.98 	 This film is a very funny film.
0.98 	 If Dani made this as a comedy then, good going him.
0.83 	 Very well done.
1.0 	 Watch it when you're in a happy, happy, joy, joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you're high on multiple different types of drugs.
0.73 	 A couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and head out into Crater Lake.
0.85 	 Snack time for Cratey!
0.83 	 Yeah, it's not hard to figure out, and you're so far ahead of the script that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold.<br /><br />The shamelessness of it all is endearing, and I really want to like "The Crater Lake Monster".
0.56 	 There are also a pair of lovable hicks in it, and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie.
0.99 	 A downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster AND one of our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it.
0.98 	 Was it the mournful song played over the closing credits?
0.88 	 Says Andy: "Nobody gets hurt, everybody wins."
0.92 	 Think "Eastern Promises", "There Will Be Blood", "No Country for Old Men".
0.54 	 The opening shots, although of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife, have the look and feel of a Dutch master's painting.
0.69 	 By contrast, the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of Mondrians.
0.74 	 But of course you don't need me to tell you that.
0.65 	 Why her character Gina would want to be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's okay.
0.72 	 Don't miss it.
0.59 	 It's just the experience during the movie that's great.<br /><br />I felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more, but being a Lynch fan I don't care that much anymore :)<br /><br />And I *loved* the style, or flair of this movie.
0.9 	 And what was the story with the younger sister about?).
0.96 	 As I said, the idea of the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too.
0.58 	 2/10 at a push.
0.59 	 When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High.
0.99 	 What a pity that it isn't!
0.73 	 These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy), but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess, except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica.
0.51 	 They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, one suspects.
0.85 	 Just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home.
0.78 	 She then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why.<br /><br />This is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite.
0.85 	 It was the all round Bollywood action/comedy movie.
1.0 	 It is a imitation of Bad Boys obviously!
0.98 	 Okay, I am a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst!
0.98 	 But it's NOT!!!
0.77 	 WTF!
1.0 	 That was the worst of all!!!
0.82 	 Now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the Freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc.
0.93 	 etc.<br /><br />And then I found out it was in 3-D!!!
0.96 	 At least it didn't go for the gutter.<br /><br />Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard.
0.64 	 Their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature.
0.91 	 i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn't try to find it anywhere.
0.54 	 Then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought "hey why not" and tried finding it on the internet.
0.95 	 at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up...it made me jump!
0.58 	 I'm here to help."
0.96 	 The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I didn't see any clues (what clues you talking about, Willis?).
0.85 	 Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here.
0.91 	 By the end of the movie I finally put it all together.
0.95 	 Well, it was obvious by then.
0.76 	 Believe me, you will won't need too many clues to figure it out.
0.98 	 I didn't.
0.96 	 <br /><br />Violence: No.
0.9 	 Sex: Yes, but nothing to get excited about.
0.97 	 Nudity: No.
0.93 	 Language: No.
0.93 	 I caught this on (a surprisingly feature-filled) DVD and it scared me silly.
0.93 	 In fact the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants.<br /><br />However, the next day I was telling someone about it when I realised I'd only really seen about 10% of it.
0.97 	 Most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production, the make-up effects really looked like it was!
0.91 	 The film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable.
0.64 	 - he feels they should seek something better.
0.85 	 He and Muriel take a drive into the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want.<br /><br />And they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to.
0.96 	 They find that the designs they have in mind, and have worked out with their architect (Reginald Denny), can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by Muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for.
0.63 	 He has been appointed to handle the "Wham" account ("Spam" had become a popular result of World War II, in that the public started using it as a meat substitute, in the light of it's success with the armed forces).
1.0 	 Jim can't get a grip on this (he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him).
0.74 	 ):<br /><br />"This little piggy went to market,<br /><br />He was pink and as pretty as ham.<br /><br />He smiled in his tracks,<br /><br />As they gave him the ax -<br /><br />He knew he would end up as "Wham"!
0.99 	 "<br /><br />His Secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one!<br /><br />Jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of Bill to Muriel, although (in this case) Bill is blameless.
0.99 	 They can't open the door, and Jim (in a panic) tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram.
0.97 	 He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods.
0.8 	 He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement.
0.58 	 He explains to her that he is going to kill them all.
0.64 	 Surely, "I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "I Spit on Your Grave" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton.
0.76 	 If you like animal movies, this movie will please.
0.91 	 A brutally depressing script and some fine low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good location shooting in Ohio power this fine TV movie about hard times in the rustbelt.
0.99 	 See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight.<br /><br />The heavy metal score -- was someone making a pun?
0.83 	 -- is, at times, obtrusively annoying, but the cinematography by Frank Stanley is knockout, particularly the mill scenes.
0.76 	 I read a couple of good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface", but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself, the picture will probably make very little sense.
0.97 	 I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them.
0.8 	 "The Man In The Attic" is a movie set in the 1910s.
1.0 	 It is inspired by a true story.
1.0 	 They use terms such as "illicit passion", "forbidden affair", and "unlimited pleasures".
0.95 	 They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.)
0.79 	 holding a gun!<br /><br />The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer.
0.97 	 She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business.
0.78 	 Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company.
0.86 	 Krista ends up having Edward live up in their attic.
0.98 	 Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory.
0.78 	 The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago."
0.51 	 4/10
0.66 	 This movie is bufoonery!
0.67 	 The "dragon lord" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy, "cowboy", totally made the movie fun, meaningful, and just plain silly.
1.0 	 But they do not depress, but rather inspire.
0.66 	 "The Kennel Murder Case" starts off at a run and doesn't stop until the very end.
0.98 	 Everybody had reason to kill the victim, and several people tried.
0.84 	 I think you will too.
1.0 	 This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian "Spaghetti" Westerns and, as is typical of such genre efforts, features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc.
1.0 	 extinct.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film, not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities, including an intriguing premise, to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD's novelization following its original release!
0.95 	 As it is, the film's sole virtue (if, indeed, it can even be called that) is its sheer eccentricity: for instance, Stevens, playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps inside a coffin(!)
0.91 	 The production team responsible for this film were also behind other Western fare around the same period of time, like CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
0.98 	 The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to re-invent themselves, but not in a tricky way like Identity or the Usual Suspects, but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting.
0.99 	 At one point Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a seminar in laughing, where he's the worst student.
0.97 	 There's not a lot of plot here.
0.92 	 There were some noticeable goofs, but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time.
0.89 	 It gets kind of silly at times, but overall I recommend it.
0.57 	 They probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.
0.72 	 The story is quite simple, and the "actors" are funny in a cute way, without any crude or complex humour.
0.74 	 ]<br /><br />There were some gags which made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not feel to fit into the story.<br /><br />Overall it's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche.
0.58 	 If you don't hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once.
0.99 	 I'd suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you'd be interested in, then go for it.
0.69 	 And indeed, he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green, too, but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I don't really mind.<br /><br />I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie.
0.88 	 Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - it looks just like 1973), and it's lacking in action.
0.68 	 Funny, isn't it, to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie...
0.97 	 This movie is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view.
0.84 	 But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away.
0.68 	 When I first watched this movie, it made me cry.
0.93 	 At the end, the janitor tries to help him, after hearing his story.
0.95 	 Will he find his long lost Marie or not?
0.9 	 To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total).
0.78 	 He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the Âorder'.
0.93 	 Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy about the story.
0.51 	 OK not hot as in pretty, but hot as in damn cool and sexy.
0.9 	 I only know, that she plays the kind of girl I like in this film, because she is not too mainstream, a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.<br /><br />OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes.
0.91 	 Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say: WHO CARES.
0.94 	 Well no one!!!
0.83 	 One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse.
1.0 	 Not that that mark is bad.
0.96 	 Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ?
0.52 	 8mm was not great, I admit that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me.
0.96 	 About the latter film I can not say anything, Âcause I have not seen it yet.
0.92 	 One thing though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I would have said YES to all of them.
0.99 	 He directed an all time horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre".
0.91 	 It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) catch fire...or something like that.
0.82 	 Hardly an original idea (anyone remember "Firestarter"?)
0.71 	 A must miss...not even good for laughs.
0.71 	 Goodness, this movie makes me SICK!
0.77 	 This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever watched.
0.96 	 Thankyou for your time.
0.82 	 We get a few more deaths, which again are good, but there's not enough of them.
0.93 	 Carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film.
0.86 	 Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan.
0.86 	 The plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point.
0.77 	 The script worked well, too.
0.7 	 I am glad they made a sequel to this film.
0.84 	 I rate this film a 9/10.

0.54 	 This is it.
0.79 	 This is the one.
0.69 	 Ever.
0.93 	 It beats everything.
0.61 	 It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe.
0.97 	 I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good.
0.76 	 I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS.
0.97 	 Trust me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this.<br /><br />Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society.
0.66 	 Please.
0.59 	 NOW.
0.98 	 It seems to combine elements of Logans Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice and at least several others.
0.6 	 At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER.
0.9 	 like the fact that, even though gas is unavailable, there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations, and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country.
0.94 	 The kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.<br /><br />John Cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels.
0.86 	 Despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal.
1.0 	 When he learns of the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel--no wait, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York City--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book.
0.93 	 The temperature in the room changes automatically.
0.54 	 The fearless writer can't open the door, etc.
0.95 	 And after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills, you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending.
0.98 	 The true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating.
0.74 	 Ballot-stuffing ghosts?
0.84 	 A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there.
0.92 	 Yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace.
0.5 	 A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer.
0.6 	 Dr. Benet(Bela Lugosi) form an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element.
0.77 	 Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X,", even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them.
0.75 	 In this context, the MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do.
0.85 	 Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained.
0.93 	 I imagine that as part of the healing process that I should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that I can *truly* put it behind me.
0.84 	 Bolt isn't.
0.58 	 Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.<br /><br />Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.
0.85 	 Who knows?
0.53 	 The plot of this film is not strong at all, lots of holes.
0.87 	 If you approach it as a car movie its not bad, lots of great cars in this one.
1.0 	 I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St.
0.94 	 Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89.
0.99 	 Its an interesting historical piece for us locals.
0.79 	 Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it.
0.86 	 Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town.
0.99 	 In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which "Play Dead" is.
0.9 	 What "Play Dead" really is, is a town full of nut jobs.
0.66 	 Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "A Simple Plan", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey.
0.51 	 - MERK
0.97 	 She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits.<br /><br />But it wouldn't be a ÂDalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification.
0.94 	 He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen Â and does it well.
0.75 	 Simply absurd, that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually "weeds" out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best .
1.0 	 Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it.
0.51 	 Computers where still "a big mystery" for the most of us and the movie was convincing, in it's own way.<br /><br />This one, however, looks like a low budget Wednesday night special.
0.98 	 We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection, even though there is no character development to illustrate this.
0.56 	 Also, this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a freeze-frame of the characters with their name written over the screen.
0.95 	 Queer as Folk).
0.8 	 But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more!
0.9 	 And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are.
0.99 	 When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun.
1.0 	 If you want humor, go to your local stand up comedy club.
0.98 	 ...........as I was when I saw this movie) I will never watch this movie again, not because it is a bad movie, but because it scared me so much!
0.91 	 What they wind up in is just that, with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside.
0.98 	 Rather than just a big chase, the film is complicated by the the daft and rather childlike Spike behaving inappropriately, and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear.
0.98 	 Frankly, I too was aggravated by Spike's ridiculous actions, especially the spray can sniffing, but in a desperate situation it's apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape.
0.98 	 After all, there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for Heaton to just ditch Spike and try to save himself.
0.63 	 It's not big-budget action entertainment.
0.98 	 The supporting cast are all solid with Dan Durya standing out as Waco Johnny Dean the live-wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger.
0.83 	 I have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere.
0.84 	 Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed."
0.75 	 Even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film.
0.97 	 This one is just a full-scale parody of TV.
0.68 	 Aside from Shapiro - who apparently didn't do anything after "Modern Problems" - the movie also stars Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer.
0.94 	 There's also a pornographic news program, an irritating cooking show, and the epic tale of some drug dealers.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole thing's just a real hoot.
0.82 	 The tale was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly.<br /><br />The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by Anne Rice.
0.92 	 If not read up on the period, because there's a lesson to be learned from it all.
0.74 	 If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere.
0.7 	 For example, try some of the darker films by Bergman.
0.95 	 There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie: Budgets are tight, Time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced.
0.99 	 The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you.
0.74 	 Why give the Gravedigger a daughter?
0.67 	 Scarecrow doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />The "story" of Scarecrow goes something like this: Lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who'd I'd peg to be in his early 30's) who is picked on by the other kids.
1.0 	 He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named Judy.
0.95 	 His mom is a lush and the town whore.
0.99 	 One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings (by calling him a "faggot" for drawing birds instead of "monsters and cowboys."
0.91 	 Magically, Lester's soul goes into the scarecrow.
0.87 	 Somehow, this transference changes Lester's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast (I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a Kung-Fu scarecrow.
0.54 	 C'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode.
0.83 	 It's just an old 60's TV show !
1.0 	 This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location.
0.61 	 He doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example.<br /><br />Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view.
0.57 	 You can clearly see the folds in the paper !
1.0 	 Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE (is this a double entendre about the star?)
1.0 	 And it works for that for that purpose: being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.<br /><br />The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice (Jennifer Love Hewitt) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam (Jimi Mistry) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice.
1.0 	 His partner Archie (Dougray Scott) is fond of both Sam and Alice, but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship.
1.0 	 Alice pals with her sister Felicity (Kate Miles), a free love advocate, who encourages Alice to have affairs.
0.99 	 On Valentine's Day, after a drinking binge with her sister, Alice mails a card to Sam signed 'Anonymous' as a test to see if Sam responds, testing his fidelity.
0.96 	 At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not.
0.83 	 Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya (Branka Katic) and is indeed cheating on Alice.
0.94 	 Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as 'Anonymous' to test his fidelity.
1.0 	 There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor, but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music/white noise.
0.76 	 Grady Harp
0.58 	 The British 'heritage film' industry is out of control.
0.61 	 This film rips the guts out of Orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy.
1.0 	 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no-one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty.
1.0 	 But this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing, and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s London, in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of Lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes.
0.98 	 Comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate-box world.
0.98 	 It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the film is packed with great actors.
1.0 	 Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power.
0.6 	 Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films I've seen, and I don't slam Disney films very often.
0.56 	 But it's not over yet, and it's time to hit PLAY again.
0.98 	 Herbie, the Volkswagen that thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion.
0.93 	 The only thing standing in her way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them.<br /><br />The original love bug wasn't that good.
0.72 	 Even as a kid, I remember not liking it very much.
0.99 	 I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie.
0.99 	 She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls.
1.0 	 Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone.
0.93 	 Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.<br /><br />Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job.
1.0 	 These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable.
0.91 	 In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid.
0.83 	 KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963; which I recall having rated BOMB) had been my introduction to cult director Honda's work; this one isn't necessarily better Â it's just that I've learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare!
0.95 	 The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo(!)
1.0 	 Â where it's shown fighting a couple of other monsters, and befriends a trio of humans.
1.0 	 Kong eventually escapes and makes it to Tokyo, where it has a final showdown with the robot.
1.0 	 I loved the show (new and old) and I loved all the movies.
0.96 	 But this movie is not as great as some people were hopeing it to be.
0.52 	 Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker had a lot of drama.
0.54 	 and Batman & Mr.
0.56 	 Also, I think this movie is to light for Batman.
0.8 	 The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end.
0.96 	 As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and *gulp* still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother?
0.99 	 Sure, Jolly Ol' Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there?
1.0 	 FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable Christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this.
1.0 	 Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe he's really the long lost brother of the never-aging Santa (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good ol' brother to visit.
0.99 	 Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas, and his THIS close to being shut down.
0.86 	 Kathy Bates of course.
0.98 	 Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend!
1.0 	 Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they're given way too little to work with.<br /><br />As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could possibly come up with is Santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf.
0.69 	 I have to admit I had a few giggles involving Fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end there.
0.84 	 Rather than have Snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster, 'The Home Front' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too.
0.83 	 The result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact.
0.81 	 ... than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie?
0.88 	 A surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does.
0.96 	 I couldn't get enough of it.
0.75 	 The TV guide calls this movie a mystery.
0.74 	 What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents.
0.92 	 This is Bollywood at its best/worst, I honestly cannot tell the difference.
0.97 	 The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses.
0.66 	 <br /><br />
0.97 	 Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life.
0.92 	 There wasn't a laugh to be had; in fact, I don't remember ever cracking a smile.
0.79 	 I've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why.
0.89 	 The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism.
0.55 	 And some people call this art?<br /><br />
0.99 	 There are simply no flaws in this one.
0.61 	 10 out of 10.
0.76 	 <br /><br />This film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story.
0.56 	 You can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out.
0.99 	 This movie is about as true about the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL police officers.
1.0 	 Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that show the Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality as Star Wars.
0.65 	 If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favour and learn the truth.
0.98 	 Besides the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song.
0.66 	 Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them.
0.7 	 And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowe's character played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker, only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo.
0.99 	 Most of the time when these kinds of actors/actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before, it's really entertaining.
0.98 	 Still, I thought "Three Days of the Condor" must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received.<br /><br />Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer, I found the whole affair tremendously disappointing.
0.77 	 Robert Taylor as the mad buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this film.
0.99 	 At the beginning I was thinking that Charlie would end up redeeming himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur.
1.0 	 Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing.
0.89 	 Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same.
0.78 	 Which actually I found quite interesting.
0.85 	 At first I was excited upon reading the description of the film.
0.51 	 3/10
0.97 	 I watch movies for a living, picking out which ones are good enough to distribute... Tossing aside those that don't make the cut.
1.0 	 So many bad movies land on my desk and I actually sit through all of them.
0.96 	 "Lou" drew me in during the first few minutes where I closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the TV so I could completely tune in.
0.52 	 I was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie.
0.99 	 Sadly I was unable to acquire it because I was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short.
0.74 	 A young scientist Harry Harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours, but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum.
0.99 	 "Servered Ties" simply lacks it own distinctive style.
0.86 	 Surprises do crop up, especially the flick's final outcome.
0.95 	 Which is well accepted, as I thought it could have copped out with something more accessible.
0.95 	 Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story, thanks to Elke Sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother.
1.0 	 Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well.
0.99 	 They were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate.
1.0 	 Billy Morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as Harry.
0.61 	 Despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor.
0.93 	 Sullivan demands a $10,000 deposit to insure that Corbett will appear to fight for the $25,000 purse.
0.83 	 Don't rent it- buy it now!
0.99 	 It may change your thoughts on Adam.
1.0 	 My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll.
0.51 	 !
0.94 	 I gave this movie a very fair chance, and it betrayed me.
0.91 	 You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic).
0.61 	 The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed.
0.92 	 I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist.
0.98 	 There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me.
0.93 	 don't watch this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda look out for this documentary and you will see facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/<br /><br />The Death of Yugoslavia documentary series (of five episodes) is a painstakingly compiled and researched account of the extended mass-bloodshed which marked the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and spanned almost the entire first half of the 1990's.
0.95 	 It includes a huge wealth of news footage and interviews with involved parties both "Yugoslav" and otherwise.
0.99 	 The only real "improvement" which could be made to this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was made.
0.91 	 This was indeed done in the late 1990's for a repeat showing on BBC television, but the addition of some even more recent events would help to complete this admirably detailed and fulsome piece of work.
1.0 	 I feel like I've just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing!
0.69 	 And I WAS entertained.
0.78 	 It was a two-parter, so you'd have to have seen both parts.
0.95 	 I have many other ones that I like, too.
0.78 	 Then, of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in "consider yourself," "I'd Do Anything" "Who Will Buy" and "be Back Soon," many who were children!
0.97 	 I read so many comments that I, too, shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but I didn't know the name of the movie.
0.9 	 I found it on ebay and I have seen several copies of it there.
0.97 	 When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy set the eagle free because he couldn't allow it to be killed.
0.94 	 After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle, the eagle, too, saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive.
0.95 	 I have never seen anything come even close to this movie!
0.57 	 We then waited and waited in the hot sun, slowly broiling but we didn't care, because the headliners were among our favourites.
1.0 	 At one point, early in the afternoon, I sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier.
0.98 	 I was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a Rheostatics t-shirt.
0.97 	 There's nothing reasonable, nor taste-determined, nor really anything except their fandom.
0.92 	 Snotty of me, isn't it?
1.0 	 Generally, a lack of money, as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help (as if somehow the feature would cease to be Canadian) leads to lower production values than American or British films, and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like, well, not like an American film.
0.93 	 Next, Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story, and tell it well.
1.0 	 Third, they seem to think that gratuitous nudity (often full-frontal) makes something artistic.
0.97 	 I thought that Forest Whitaker's performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character Lian-Chu is depicted in this movie.
0.58 	 It Has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories.
0.96 	 I won't bore you with the plot (who cares?
0.8 	 with his trusty lash.
0.98 	 Ah WINTER KILLS , based on the novel by Richard Condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago .
0.99 	 I knew Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller<br /><br />WINTER KILLS left me cold .
1.0 	 First off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner .
0.97 	 Take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called Dawson .
0.59 	 Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane .
0.98 	 96 minutes of this is cruel..and I love the old Munster's.
0.99 	 There is so much 'intrigue' (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if it's an old Starsky & Hutch episode.
0.99 	 Oh, and the best part!
0.77 	 Lily says responds with something like: "You're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track."
0.93 	 What's amazing about this is: Yvonne DeCarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt.
0.56 	 He never recovered and this financially devastated her family.
0.52 	 (check out Biography's fantastic review of her life and career) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her.<br /><br />If you are a real fan of the Munster's then you'll have to RENT this mess.
0.96 	 It illustrates how some things are better left alone.
0.96 	 I just want to make one thing clear- I love Michael Vartan!
0.77 	 But this film really lets him down.
1.0 	 His acting is still superb, he's still as charming as ever, and he still looks great.
0.97 	 Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say it, comes over bit manly... you're constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend, who's own sub-storyline is a little weird.
0.69 	 Myself and my family (who sat down and watched the film with me) were also put off by the soundtrack to the film; at times the music just didn't fit with what was going on in the scenes.
0.96 	 He is put in a cell with three others; the quietly insane Lassalle, body building transvestite Marcus and his retarded boyfriend Daisy.
0.96 	 After a short while in the cell together, they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal.
0.82 	 Anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying!
0.9 	 I'm surprised there's people who didn't like it!
0.73 	 And I've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies!
0.97 	 For crying out loud,I'm 22!!!
0.74 	 I mean, OK, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish.
1.0 	 So many clichÃ©s yet none fails to surprise/scare!
0.91 	 You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO!
0.92 	 and you still jump off the chair.
0.96 	 Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature.<br /><br />The recent (since 2000) versions of Beowulf make we wonder two things.
0.52 	 Spare me.
0.78 	 This is insulting.<br /><br />/hjm
0.98 	 According to the movie, he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from, but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father.
0.96 	 After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie.
0.64 	 they finally succeed), then they don't know what to do with it (after 7 years?)
0.89 	 Yvette Mimeux looks as if she's smoked up all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown.
0.92 	 But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
0.97 	 It was fairly easy to watch (at 3am).
0.98 	 It had good casting - Kevin Dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling.
0.96 	 A sociopathic "genetic material" donor fixates on the recipients and, in typical stalker form, intrudes into their lives.<br /><br />As I said, most of the movie was fairly good.. we see "Conan" grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother.
0.98 	 I am pretty tolerant with movies (especially at 3am!)..
0.98 	 The only redeaming quality here was Kevin Dillon's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.<br /><br />Try looking around at the other channels before watching this..
1.0 	 Four best friends young male chauvinist pigs (with the emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a NYC diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy.
0.71 	 Well, what was fun... except for the fun part.<br /><br />It's my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'.<br /><br />Let's start with the good.
1.0 	 The teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional.
0.94 	 Being the great animal lover that I am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.<br /><br />But then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it.
0.66 	 There were about one or two quotable lines.
0.81 	 shame because Season 2 was doing so well.
0.91 	 I never was an avid viewer of "Crocodile Hunter", but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about Steve Irwin's death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention.
0.94 	 This movie, with Steve and his wife, Terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but I didn't hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it.
0.54 	 While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt, and are unaware of what's inside it, two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon!
0.97 	 The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them!
0.96 	 Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt, played by Magda Szubanski, is supposed to be, she's not.
0.99 	 No matter which side you're on, "The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course" is not a well crafted movie.
0.71 	 I'm sure it does help if you're a big Steve Irwin fan, but even if you are, there's no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven't been impressed.
0.51 	 1/10
0.64 	 and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit.
0.82 	 Unfortunately, Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
0.93 	 I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an "AA" rating, and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment.<br /><br />The acting was OK, but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication.
0.7 	 Oh, and Bad people happen to Good people.
0.71 	 HOW CREATIVE.I don't get why they need a TV show I mean most artist don't really need a TV show about themselves, especially the naked brothers band.
0.52 	 If you didn't stay up, you were missing out.<br /><br />I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live on, but I want them back where they belong...MONSTERVISION!
0.57 	 Question...did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of "The Swarm" ?
0.71 	 Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie).
0.99 	 He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince.
0.99 	 In "The Far Country", Stewart's Jeff Webster, by not getting involved to help anyone else (except himself), gets to see essentially the same thing: A world in which he (for all practical matters) doesn't exist.<br /><br />By not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), Webster is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing.
0.7 	 I was very moved by this movie.
0.99 	 I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him, and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train.
0.89 	 This is in no way meant to bash gays (I am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others.
0.65 	 The only part of the movie I couldn't understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include Marcel in Leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral.<br /><br />I think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is DO NOT HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX!
0.9 	 After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first.
0.91 	 The video store shelves are filled with these so called films.
0.84 	 Cheap and very dated effects.
1.0 	 Nothing interesting or exciting happens.
0.61 	 Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn Toulon's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets.
0.98 	 But I guess Paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from 1).
0.6 	 Brando plays the ace jet pilot, just back from shooting MiGs down in the Korean War.
0.95 	 But, this is not Hollywood.
0.99 	 The only caveat, and it has to be stated, is that this is a depressing film.
0.68 	 Do that.
0.93 	 It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel.
1.0 	 Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts.
1.0 	 The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I don't really have much else negative to say about this movie.
0.53 	 When Frankie is killed during his attempted arrest, the Irish Republican Army, of which both Frankie and Gypo were members, begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident, every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death, and descends into a bout of heavy-drinking that rivals Don Birnam in 'The Lost Weekend (1945)' in its excessiveness.
0.74 	 A relatively simple fellow, Gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions, and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his "not knowing what he was doing," but his foolishness must not go unpunished.<br /><br />Criticism is occasionally levelled at Ford's film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a "terrorist" organisation.
0.98 	 For some reason, various young couples hiking through the Italian Alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first.
0.95 	 James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse.
1.0 	 Yes the CGI demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously.
0.98 	 Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go.
0.84 	 She soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist, but soon tutoring becomes much more then art, and soon after that, scandal erupts!
0.87 	 Also, it's quite funny when she's insisting that she "paints for herself!"
1.0 	 yet falls for the first person she sees.<br /><br />Actually, the story itself is quite fascinating, and it ends with a trial, which I always love.
0.86 	 The Second Renaissance, part 1 let's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans.
0.99 	 riots between the robots and mankind.
0.54 	 Somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points it, it's all a little too clever.<br /><br />The animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (in particular Osiris) work for the best.
0.51 	 4/10.
0.85 	 I give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs.
0.91 	 More significantly, however, watching this movie I can't help but notice some interesting parallels between the "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies.
0.97 	 Obviously "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups at work here, but if you've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two.
0.92 	 But there are a lot of questions unanswered.
0.8 	 Too bad hes too old for me though.
1.0 	 Plus the cat starts to really get lame, as the show continued, the jokes began just to get stupid, and the things that the audio controlled "audience" would laugh at, I would think it was so lame.
0.53 	 Don't get me wrong, at some parts it was funny, but I think the show just kind of lost its "magic" so to speak as the show went on.
1.0 	 I give kudos to all the cast though for trying, although that Soleil Moon Frye girl had no taste, and she was a horrid actress.
0.73 	 I wonder what Melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter, now that the show has ended.
0.99 	 So I didn't expect much, especially after having watched the rather disappointing "Shark Zone" just a few days before.
0.92 	 We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, man-eating plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark.
0.97 	 The only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for TV it's understandable why these scenes are missing.
0.94 	 There are two reasons why I gave it seven out of ten points, though: First of all, the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, William Forsythe just isn't the right guy for the "hero" part and for falling in love with gorgeous Hunter Tylo.
0.69 	 But the problem is that it's not very good.
0.97 	 On its own, it's not very good.
0.94 	 And compared to others, it's still not very good.
0.58 	 But it is not without its good points!
0.97 	 It was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end.
0.81 	 Any of them might die, but it's possible to pinpoint the final "survivor" from very early on.
0.99 	 Wooden performances abound.
1.0 	 All the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never seemed to arrive.
0.83 	 Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone.
0.8 	 My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even.
0.87 	 The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding.
0.96 	 The fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
0.55 	 I do agree with everything Calamine has said!
0.97 	 And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine has said is very true, it is time for the girls to move on to better roles.
1.0 	 I would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and I would like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their career as well as their personal life.
0.74 	 So producers, please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit, move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets.
0.94 	 When In Rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence I think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds, maybe some that are like the sixth sense, the hour, chocolat, that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them, humour ones too yes, but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and New York Minute.
1.0 	 This movie was a particular disappointment to me, since it features two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, boasts a score by the often wonderous Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights," "Ice Station Zebra," "The Thomas Crowne Affair").
1.0 	 Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit.
1.0 	 I'm glad other people enjoyed "The Young Girls of Rochefort," though I most certainly did not.
0.61 	 Although I can now only remember bits of it, I long to see it again.
0.64 	 The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, include Mustard gas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him.
0.91 	 There must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available.
0.87 	 Anyone know why?
0.98 	 I doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.
0.99 	 When anyone comes into a film of this type of film it's not without saying that an overdose of that great over-the-counter brain-medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, comes in mighty handy.<br /><br />Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna/Brigitta, the woman who Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but who also is -- an angel sent to Earth.<br /><br />My reaction when I saw this was a mute gasp of "Hunh?"
0.99 	 Much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra-low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey.<br /><br />Anyway, not to elaborate, this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy, neither very good actors but terrific singers, would be together playing up the "innocence" and "clean-cut" romance that they were known for.
0.9 	 Years ago I did follow a soap on TV.
1.0 	 How did someone get all those top-notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie?
0.76 	 Ron Ely is a God.It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK.
0.96 	 I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron.
0.86 	 But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie.
0.59 	 I give Soldier *** 1/2 out of *****
1.0 	 Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver!
0.59 	 Wow!
0.93 	 Stewart Moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife, and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head...imagine the auditions for this.."can you...no, that's not quite it, thank you, next!".
0.54 	 To its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he's just nuts or whether he's actually transforming into something until almost the very end.
0.67 	 It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series.
0.78 	 Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because the water is low in oxygen and doesn't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals, like large sharks, etc.
0.99 	 I started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me, and it barely has a plot!
0.59 	 Wow.
0.57 	 Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion.
0.97 	 Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time.
0.68 	 You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time.
0.96 	 Solid particles can pass through barriers.
0.93 	 All of this, so far, is accurate.
0.99 	 Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate.
0.61 	 Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
0.98 	 Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter.
0.95 	 Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures(..his brother is a victim of the croc).
0.77 	 In regards to Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, I stick with Carnosaur.
0.99 	 As expected, Pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion(..gulp).
0.98 	 Ultimately though this one just didn't work.
0.96 	 <br /><br />It wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive.
0.94 	 This is what I believe happened here.<br /><br />I suggest reading the book!
0.56 	 I'd have given it a 9 if it were not for the salute at the end!
0.8 	 The Shining, you know what's weird about this movie?
0.93 	 Who could forget "All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy"?
0.58 	 Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly Room 237.
0.99 	 Danny starts calling out the word "redrum" frantically, and scribbling it on walls.
1.0 	 Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" formatted in various ways.
0.94 	 Horrified, Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat, locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen.
0.6 	 Danny has written "REDRUM" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom.
0.89 	 When she looks in the mirror, she sees that it is "Murder" spelled backwards.
1.0 	 I don't normally like music things like this, but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box.
0.5 	 The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto, but this is probably an exaggerated event.
0.99 	 The police and army did shoot students, but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this.
0.97 	 This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students.
0.68 	 The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied.
0.96 	 But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws.
0.9 	 Trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, snappy timing, and taste.
0.78 	 They have a sense of self-parody and bravura abandonment (they do throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell.
0.82 	 Miles O'Keeffe (who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time) has the title role, but plays third fiddle to John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's sense of self-importance.
0.93 	 A healthy gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.98 	 and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life.
0.51 	 Ex-abortionist?
0.78 	 A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.<br /><br />It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him.
0.82 	 Good owl-wrangling, though, and I really felt cold all the way through.
0.67 	 Instead, a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room--an idea repeated in quite a few other detective films (such as CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE).
0.77 	 Dire.
0.51 	 :(
0.68 	 This little film had long been on my "keeper" list.
0.67 	 Think about that!
0.8 	 They pray for rescue.
0.74 	 However, as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them, they begin to wonder whether they are alone.<br /><br />Admittedly, the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes, which hurls at the group a polar bear, a giant beastie and the possibility of others on the island.
0.93 	 After the 974th plot twist of the series, it finally dawns on the viewer that it doesn't actually matter whether the plane-crash survivors make it off the island.
1.0 	 You know, like it's popular to hate Uwe Boll whether you liked his movies or not.
0.63 	 I once read that "Seed" was Uwe Boll's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of Torture Porn flicks, but that's not even close.
0.58 	 who wears a bag over his head.
0.54 	 Nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him!
0.85 	 Trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan.
0.79 	 The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT film.
1.0 	 The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect.
0.5 	 Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators.
0.51 	 I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow.
0.9 	 What a hoot!
0.72 	 Don't miss it!
0.88 	 Cheers to the director and all the actors.
0.96 	 Way before the 'Scary Movie' series there were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s.
0.97 	 But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss.
0.76 	 But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that's 'Transylvania 6-5000,' a major waste of time for many reasons.<br /><br />Pros: A great cast that does it's best.
0.78 	 A corny, but catch theme song.
0.99 	 Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This is a comedy?
0.98 	 See 'Transylvania Twist' instead.<br /><br />My rating: 2/5
0.7 	 A previous reviewer, John Mankin, questions why the central focus of the film, the mansion called Elephant Walk, should have been built by the former owner, the "governor" the late Tom Wiley, right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water, the river.
0.98 	 To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film: the hubris of man.
0.82 	 The point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking, and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated, but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd, and thus he would dominate his son and all around him, and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water.
0.99 	 Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water?
0.85 	 Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject.
0.6 	 Political correctness flies out the window in every episode.
1.0 	 Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment, and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly, but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility.
0.63 	 And in that sense, I was right - considering the cringe-making dialogue they were given, both of them perform reasonably well.
0.83 	 This two songs that have the same melody... but people don't usually realize that... it's just grate!
0.79 	 Kept me glued through the entire picture.
0.92 	 Some can complain there isn't too much physical combat, besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes, spirits fighting by hand-to-hand wouldn't really make sense at all.
0.64 	 A few years back the same persons who created Paris,J'TAIME., which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7), created this piece of garbage about New York City.<br /><br />In Paris, I Love You (J'taime)created a feeling for Paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful Paris.<br /><br />In this current film, I did not recognize New York City, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth.<br /><br />New York does have 5 boroughs,I saw no scenes in The Bronx, or Queens ,There is one scene in Brooklyn,(Brighton Beach), I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village/ No scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres.
0.9 	 The guns are more quiet than a mute.
0.73 	 How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind.
0.98 	 This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch.
0.78 	 I have said that it includes a spoiler.
0.53 	 I suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film.
0.93 	 But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film.
0.66 	 It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match.
0.96 	 Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering between the contestants, and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings.
0.66 	 At one point he even enumerates "One... Two... Three... Four..." as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event.
0.99 	 And people were glued to their radios for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches.
0.99 	 The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'.
0.81 	 It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.<br /><br />The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage.
0.94 	 And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage.
0.71 	 Shocking!
0.86 	 Like a sheet to play ghosts with.
0.68 	 " It had to be You" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas.
0.69 	 This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned Author.
0.96 	 He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married.
0.98 	 The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together.
0.88 	 Andie McDowell is beautiful as the 40-ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling-out with 2 long-time best girldfriends.<br /><br />Seeing a gigolo/gold-digger in the sincere young man, the "girl-friends", dead-set on terminating this "silly relationship", go over and beyond the call of duty in "helping out" their friend (who obviously is blinded by this gigolo's tricky game".<br /><br />A short succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous.
1.0 	 Without these unbelievable scenes, there may have been hope for a sweet love story.
0.94 	 The somber stoicism that all characters except Banderas' showed made me think they were drugged.
1.0 	 Australia is undergoing awful weather, with storms, hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution.
1.0 	 A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do.
0.96 	 So kudos to them .They'll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book.
0.6 	 Well-done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way.
0.95 	 what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers.
0.99 	 and its sad that people think it makes her a hero.
1.0 	 positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience.
0.98 	 I borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me.
1.0 	 I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco since I live near SF.
0.99 	 And of course it was nice to see shots of the Castro district (although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female).
0.97 	 There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words.
1.0 	 They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened--he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired.
0.72 	 His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin (what a name!)
0.99 	 (No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL.)
0.8 	 The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive.
0.79 	 This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas.
1.0 	 One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - "Are you putting me on, doll?
0.91 	 Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others).
0.97 	 Good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS).
0.94 	 Strange ending but fitting.
1.0 	 Best performance Stacey Walker.
0.6 	 I just saw this recently, after an interval of nearly forty years.
0.97 	 )<br /><br />I disagree with the other post that decried its G rating.
0.63 	 The ratings system, brand new at the time, never intended the G (General) rating to mean "completely devoid of conflict".<br /><br />Characterizing it as unsuitable for kids reminds me of the description I once saw of The Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters.
0.81 	 She then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again.
0.99 	 The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later Lucas).
0.84 	 And just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up.
0.88 	 This was the first movie where you COULDN'T.
0.99 	 And if the Trek/Wars technobabble turns you off, FP's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today.
0.86 	 We didn't get to spend as much time there as I would have liked.<br /><br />If you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching FP will explain all that.
0.76 	 Anyone who has ever served time in the US military can see how bogus this film is.
0.55 	 (The truth is, no one knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as horses.)
0.99 	 War is NOT fun and I know WWII, Korean, and Viet Nam vets with some pretty serious ailments, too.
0.74 	 (And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.)
0.97 	 In the end, the girl calls the hero "a good Protector", but he gets both his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun.
0.5 	 Instead, they took it into custody?!
0.51 	 ?
0.91 	 I saw this movie when I was a child.
0.82 	 It blew me away.
0.73 	 I found myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for months after the film left town.
0.67 	 I would recommend this movie to any and everyone.
0.84 	 Also, June Duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture.
0.78 	 This series don't seem to be quite as serious as the first one.
0.98 	 She is soon chasing ghosts and Helmer is doing everyone mad and it's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the Kingdom.<br /><br />This story involves a lot more comedy that the previous.
0.99 	 It's well written, but some of the new elements are just kind of silly, but they save it by making it more like a comedy.
0.54 	 It's an odd story and setting.
0.94 	 I didn't think that green thing looked all too good.
1.0 	 Thought it was unoriginal and didn't fit.
0.73 	 The non-digital effects looks good too.
0.85 	 Little Brother looks just really odd, but you accept it.
0.95 	 If you'd seen Riget you can see this one without being disappointed.
0.91 	 These two makes up a series you don't wanna miss.
0.91 	 ... and how they bore you right out of your mind!
0.65 	 This movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath Crater Lake...a meteor falls from the sky, and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding Crater Lake.
0.81 	 The whole matter is taken care of by Steve our local sheriff.
0.93 	 Laurel and Hardy watch out!
1.0 	 And at the very least, the lake is beautiful.
0.69 	 The whole movie starts with some trouble at The Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami.
0.58 	 The problem is all fixed by Lisa Reisert, the manager of the hotel.
0.77 	 Then they board the plane, and crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other.
0.98 	 I won't give anything away.
0.83 	 Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport.
0.5 	 Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay, and crazily enough, Rippner is already there.
0.54 	 In total, about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end.<br /><br />Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it.
0.98 	 Well, I was entertained all right.
0.98 	 I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles.<br /><br />See the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west.
0.92 	 See also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920's, here decades before the style was invented.
1.0 	 Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all truly fine.
0.9 	 A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from 'Johnny Guitar', but doesn't quite impress the same way.
0.95 	 That is one of the reasons Corman's work appeals to me and that is why I dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance.
0.75 	 Yes, if only life could be this way!
0.91 	 I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie.
0.93 	 I could not stop laughing for the entire show.
0.76 	 Perhaps Canadian movie producers are consciously trying to "de-commercialize" their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing....
0.96 	 I went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot.
0.52 	 The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords.
0.78 	 He/she then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers.
0.93 	 The Power Rangers win, the villain gets mad, they all teach a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends.
1.0 	 Here's a side you haven't heard yet.<br /><br />Elvis Presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because I don't have to think when I watch them.
1.0 	 Now if you're like me and appreciate "the trash value", this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience.
1.0 	 Gregory Peck's acting was excellent, as one would expect, and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic "moment."
0.51 	 4/10.
0.94 	 Here Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again.
0.64 	 Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK!
1.0 	 He has a nice evil laugh.
0.98 	 The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts.
0.98 	 Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks.
1.0 	 CB4 was awful, but it may have given Cundieff the idea to it better.
0.86 	 rent or get this at all costs, even if you're not really into rap music, this will still leave you gassing out loud.
0.6 	 There are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub (performed by a frog and a dragonfly), a scuffle between a beetle and a grasshopper, and a large-scale donnybrook at the cinema, which ends with the projector bursting into flames.
0.96 	 (And the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story, which suggests that there's another version out there somewhere.)
0.61 	 This overrated, short-lived series (a measly two seasons) is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar.
0.92 	 What exactly is their criteria of what is original?
0.98 	 Sure, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" it's original.
0.61 	 Definitely.
0.6 	 You want weird?
1.0 	 You want a unique TV show?
0.96 	 Watch "The Prisoner".
0.98 	 Felini's and Leone's films offer that.
0.99 	 Kens & Barbies en masse.<br /><br />In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series.
1.0 	 Unique faces?
0.92 	 Like Lara Flynn Boyle's?
0.84 	 Sheryll Fenn's?
0.72 	 Everything Lynch made post-"Elephant Man" was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies.
0.95 	 In other words, Lynch is every intellectual-wannabe's darling.
0.77 	 <br /><br />So Laura Palmer was killed by her Dad...?
1.0 	 That's the best this "great mind" could come up with... You've got B-movie horror films that end with more originality.
0.53 	 After posing for her, Tassi violently rapes her.
0.94 	 Her father is outraged.
0.95 	 It may be funny in cartoons, but not in a motion picture.<br /><br />The film's young hero is Junior (Michael Oliver) who, since he was a baby, has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption.
0.94 	 He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who are dying to have a child, in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood.<br /><br />Junior becomes a member of the Healy household, and "Little" Ben takes an interest in him, despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site, or throws a cat at his father "Big" Ben (Jack Warden), a bigoted politician.<br /><br />I think that we're supposed to care for Junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people.
1.0 	 That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers?
0.98 	 There's a lot of profanity and mean-spirited pranks here, that one may wonder about the dividing between the PG and the PG-13.<br /><br />Kids will enjoy this, but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen.
0.87 	 Though it was obviously a cheesy TV movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed I was hooked and had to watch it through to the end.
0.79 	 No, not very.
0.68 	 The grainy film quality.
0.82 	 The spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs.
0.89 	 So much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile ("Cujo"?).
0.73 	 The filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form.
0.99 	 The pairing of the brother and sister from the "Witch Mountain" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine.
0.9 	 His self-doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its naÃ¯vetÃ©.<br /><br />The movie's The-End-Question-Mark type ending is one of the only ones I've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it.<br /><br />Detractors of this film may say it's merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about "Blade Runner".
0.86 	 This is a bit of a first for me, the first time I have ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton film.
1.0 	 Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film.
0.95 	 Come back Tim.
0.66 	 And mostly, it's for two reasons.
0.79 	 As if it all really happened.
0.51 	 This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often.
0.92 	 Love story or not.
0.99 	 Before you flame on me, I love movies, I thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed, so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Get Devil's Rejects, now that's a classic.
0.81 	 at least this thing is good'.
0.99 	 The only thing I don't like is I can't get it on tape, I've tried looking for it but with no success.
0.67 	 Any one know how to get it?
0.95 	 This is where title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works, along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor).
0.97 	 Patients and their visitors are around too, including pregnant Mrs. Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous dad-to-be husband Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor).
0.99 	 Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing.
1.0 	 the only thing great about the movie is its title.
0.88 	 The only thing make SOAP better is its title.
1.0 	 If it wasn't for its title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie.
0.97 	 The R rated superstar Edge!
0.95 	 If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop.
0.57 	 <br /><br />8 out of 10.
0.76 	 In truth, to ride from the Ponderosa (all of Northern Lake Tahoe), one would have to ride his horse about 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) down the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley then another 30-40 miles to Virginia city.<br /><br />Needless to say the Cartwrights would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis.
0.91 	 But every writer should have some leeway with the truth.<br /><br />How I miss that show, even today.
0.8 	 When I started watching this movie I saw the dude from Buffy, Xander, and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies.
0.54 	 Now a weird movie I can stand, given that it's a good dose of weird like for example David Lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc.
0.95 	 And you sort of have to be in the mood for one.
0.97 	 Mason finds the top man, and is faced with a dilemma.<br /><br />"The Unknown Man" is a small, black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists, though the plot is somewhat contrived.
0.99 	 And that's the most contrived part of all.
0.81 	 He was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did.
0.53 	 It may be because by the time he was getting leads, he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinÃ©e idol; or it could be he lacked that certain something; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like Greer Garson.
0.97 	 This movie is goofy as hell!
0.66 	 The characters are actually slightly developed, too.
0.87 	 One thing I hate, though, was the hairdryer-weapons.
0.52 	 What was that all about?
0.76 	 It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would of made so if He's going to lend his name to it, than it has to be good right?
0.65 	 None of it really worked out.<br /><br />Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter.
0.93 	 I really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories.
0.63 	 None of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case.
0.99 	 So does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants?
0.95 	 I think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, with the exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ" maybe.
1.0 	 Sure I don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance Caleb Deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that I don't like Robert Richardson's work, he really did some amazing work for most of Oliver Stone's work but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award way more.
1.0 	 Also I would had liked seeing Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music.
0.64 	 But oh well, there is no way the Academy Awards can please everybody of course, I understand that.
0.95 	 There will always be people complaining about the winners.<br /><br />It also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners.
1.0 	 And were is Sean Penn's sense of humor?
0.86 	 I'm sitting here Nov 2006 and I still can't help rave about this movie.
0.96 	 Running Man, Predator, and Total Recall (1990).
0.61 	 The cheesy one liners by Arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion.
0.5 	 I find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in Predator and Totall Recall.
0.82 	 Also the computer graphics of the "The Running Man" game show intro would not look like that in 2017.
0.95 	 Not once during this movie did I want to get up and not care about the ending which is something I do often with today's movie's.
0.74 	 Now I would not have elected him governor but that's California for you.
0.99 	 When the stalker is dead...he's dead.
0.99 	 It doesn't go on for 20 minutes each.
0.58 	 If you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
0.81 	 the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A. DuPont, first graduate of the May Class; and George Custer, last grad of the June Class.
0.97 	 With a Bo Derek movie, the audience get just what they expect.
0.93 	 The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive.
1.0 	 He is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes.
0.98 	 Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes.
0.97 	 If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada.
0.84 	 Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a news stand, and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station.
0.82 	 I am still amazed this was shot over 12 days, oh the glory days of Hollywood, when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell...
0.99 	 Denise Crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card.
0.96 	 Only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once Gage comes back from the "Semetary."
0.8 	 A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive.<br /><br />Survive?
0.52 	 I am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that!
0.73 	 I suppose that, for Yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower.
0.88 	 If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film.<br /><br />There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die.
0.92 	 This film is also about a sort of living dead.
1.0 	 The often-reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a "delightful romance" and that Sanders is "superb."
0.92 	 The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as *Marie Antoinette*, and certainly the deplorable *Forever Amber* (which screams for a classy remake).
0.72 	 I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid, breast-heaving potboilers.
0.7 	 I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role.
0.99 	 The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery, working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline.
0.73 	 This is a film i decided to go and see because I'm a huge fan of adult animation.
0.62 	 Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer.
0.57 	 I would recommend it.
0.75 	 The only good thing about this movie, is the soundtrack.Some good songs, and that is why I give 2 out of 10.
1.0 	 Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living.
0.95 	 He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very good on mainland without his skis... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that's all.
0.99 	 She obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs.
1.0 	 I have to be honest, i was expecting a failure so bad, because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money.
0.74 	 But that wasn't the case with this pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie.
0.97 	 While the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end, it works.
0.58 	 8 out of 10
0.82 	 Just one year after "The Breakfast Club", a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo's Fire" (who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles.<br /><br />Was it the directing or the writing.
0.94 	 Since it was the same person (Joel Schumacher) it must be both.
1.0 	 But then Schumacher has since given us "The Phantom of the Opera", "Phone Booth", "A Time to Kill", and two Batman movies, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman Forever" which range from good to great directing.
0.77 	 Something went wrong on "StEF" because it has no genius whatsoever, no comedy worth anything, and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life.
0.98 	 Billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but Wendy "is not ready".
0.98 	 Wendy, in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends.
0.98 	 Later in the story, when Billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together.
0.99 	 Billy is leaving for New York, deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter, he convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect "going away gift" from her to him.
0.68 	 And Wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, seems not to be phased at all by this despot.
0.75 	 Give me a break.
0.99 	 The one thing she can only give once, she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends?
0.64 	 However, coming out of the theater, those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie.
0.89 	 It never did.<br /><br />If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie.<br /><br />I registered for IMDb comments just in the hope that perhaps I can warn others against viewing this movie.
0.8 	 Befriended by a lame con-man (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in Florida, a land his friend "Ratzo" dreams of living in.<br /><br />But even in this final quest, the two are losers.
0.93 	 I, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97.
0.9 	 It was a below average film at best, defiantly not the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fanboys like to make it out as.
0.78 	 Considering the lack of art with in African cinema (or Black American Cinema).
0.93 	 But the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short.
0.84 	 But considering the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's last venture 500 Years Later, music is to be expected.
0.79 	 But from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problemÂbrilliant stuff!
0.72 	 It is not a strictly biographical film; it is "loosely based" on the facts.
0.6 	 The soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds, starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits, accompanied by wordless wailing.
0.99 	 There are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat, unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass.
0.65 	 He is always frantically busy, scurrying from appointment to appointment, never at rest.
1.0 	 But his activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable.
0.92 	 It is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions, including a perpetual motion machine (a true detail from the book - he did claim to have invented many machines); he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself.
0.55 	 And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film, from the opening giant wheel in the movie house, to Petiot's bicycle (with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives), to the Victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill.
0.9 	 Disposing of bodies?
0.51 	 His insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in Paris; when killing, robbing and disappearing are happening all around, nobody pays attention as Petiot tosses more corpses on the pile.
1.0 	 Envy stars some of the best.
1.0 	 Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and the great Christopher Walken.
0.99 	 With such a cast, one can only expect the best.
0.88 	 However, with "Envy", no one could save this disaster.<br /><br />Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers at a sandpaper factory.
0.99 	 Nick is a dreamer who's always coming up with new ideas for inventions.
0.74 	 Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product.
0.99 	 He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50/50.
0.98 	 He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy deserts.
0.98 	 Tim starts feeling envy for Nick.
0.77 	 Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character named "J-man", made this movie funny.
0.95 	 Such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it's actuality.
0.61 	 10 out of 10.
0.99 	 First off, I'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing.
0.92 	 MST3000 made it's living off that.<br /><br />If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle on this sucker.
0.51 	 The adolescent boy attitude toward sex, with the "gigolo" captain (good call on that one, guys!)
0.8 	 On paper, the script seems hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes - I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the 70s/80s.
0.73 	 FranÃ§oise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts.
0.96 	 She once lost her child daughter in Berlin, who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket, in just one moment of inattentiveness.
0.71 	 But in the end she is empty-handed, Toni has disappeared with a man, and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman.
0.58 	 "Marie is dead," concludes FranÃ§oise's husband, and the statement could not be more disillusioning.
0.77 	 Nina is just a "niÃ±a", a girl without name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment.
0.99 	 Therefore, in the end, we see Nina all alone, about to walk along the road that has opened up before her, into a future that seems joyless and uncertain.
1.0 	 The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy.
0.99 	 The cast helps very little.
0.76 	 Not a good rating to be sure, but generous given all the problems I have with the movie.
0.87 	 It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera.
0.93 	 This is a pass all the way!
0.77 	 Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think.
1.0 	 How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film?
0.97 	 Surely they jest.
0.97 	 His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least.
0.85 	 Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil.
0.61 	 In A Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.<br /><br />Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs.
0.55 	 What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film Â the clichÃ©d kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like.
0.63 	 Pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood.
1.0 	 Being a big fan of the "other" PLANET OF THE APES films, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton.
0.83 	 I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter.
0.73 	 That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better.
0.74 	 The only major fight scene in "Beat Street" was when graffiti artist Ramon (which in the movie was abbreviated as "Ramo") is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail.
0.96 	 Well, although that chase scene ended tragically, it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot.<br /><br />Most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hip-hop culture, and rap music.
0.65 	 A lot of rap music appeared in the flick, because hip-hop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life.
0.72 	 In this her last film, her performance is very average and even unassured.
0.95 	 And that's the problem with this film.
0.99 	 You'd think that would be a no-brainer, but nooo.
0.96 	 She looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role.
0.73 	 I found her "I could die at any moment" look quite disconcerting, and it greatly detracted from her supposed "hotness" and the "sexual tension" the film intended to create.
0.65 	 The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death "poetry".
1.0 	 To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear.
0.59 	 The film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it.
0.9 	 It should have never been aired.
1.0 	 It's not great.
0.52 	 You should never see it.
0.99 	 Turn to the THE CW for Smallville.
0.99 	 Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, Those are much better family shows.
0.63 	 So believe me on this, I've watched it before.
0.78 	 So do me a favor, and never watch this show.
0.95 	 The odd thing is, it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in Cinema fiction.
0.98 	 I would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts.
0.67 	 However, much was right.
0.86 	 No wonder the sequence ended 'That's Entertainment' after all other MGM musical highlights had gone by!
0.53 	 Although the voice overs by the cast (Craig, McCormack, Pryce etc.)
0.97 	 We have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies.
0.84 	 Some folks might think that was an improvement.
0.96 	 I don't.
0.92 	 He's initially in it for the bucks, but eventually falls for her.
0.99 	 The results are predictable.
0.8 	 You get a little bit of everything in this movie.
0.99 	 We never get to meet the parents, but they must really have been screwed up The cast is practically unknown.
0.99 	 One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar.
1.0 	 The acting is so bad it's hard to believe.
0.6 	 It was released under the United Artists umbrella by a company called Bel-Air Productions.
0.75 	 It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits.
1.0 	 The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke.
1.0 	 It was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene.<br /><br />I can't explain it - not even to myself - but I gave this pile of trash an 8/10.
0.76 	 I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad it's good", but I don't think I ever ran into the phenomenon before.
0.51 	 these scenes were weak and unoriginal(obviously).by the way,the movie is set in Australia,so if you're a sucker for a chick with an Aussie accent(like me)you'll be in heaven.if you not,than it just might grate on you.one other great thing about this movie:beautiful Kylie Minogoue(just don't get too attached to her)there is one non Aussie accent,courtesy of Molly Ringwald.overall,there are more reasons to watch than not.i enjoyed it and had some fun.so,i have to give "Cut" 8/10,which may seem too high to some people.
0.87 	 I mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment?
0.71 	 Louis Sachar thats who.
0.78 	 For example Caveman/Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there.
0.68 	 Weight wise and height wise but ZigZag/Ricky was taller and Armpit/Theodore was bigger.
0.98 	 Also X-Ray/Rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't.
0.98 	 The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long.
0.93 	 I would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion.
0.96 	 Belmondo is a tough cop.
0.97 	 He goes after a big-time drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a great villain - see "Sharky's Machine"; but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma).
0.94 	 He goes to the scuzziest places of Paris and Marseilles, asks for some names, beats up some people, gets the names, goes to more scuzzy places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.97 	 I have seen this movie so many times and I find it even actual these days (2003) when Italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship (or the US for that matter).
0.99 	 I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write.
0.76 	 2 thumbs up.
1.0 	 "Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for Midwest meth, but it comes across as a hard R rated "Reefer Madness".
0.83 	 It wasn't until the end of the film that I realized I was supposed to think these two were recent high-school graduates to explain some of their naivetÃ©, as we are bombarded by their school photos, but if so, they even looked older than the folks on "The O.C.".
0.99 	 Rosanna Arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano.
1.0 	 <br /><br />With a limited budget, the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly, with quite scary hallucinations.
0.83 	 We certainly see them go crazy.
0.69 	 <br /><br />While the Iowa locations are used very well (including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery), the accents and church references are confusingly Southern Baptist.
1.0 	 Guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner-city drug-dealing movie.<br /><br />The songs of Iowa's best known bard Greg Brown are used throughout, but oddly are not listed in the credits.
0.81 	 Because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in India.<br /><br />No wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women.
0.99 	 That of course is the problem with taking, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago.
0.99 	 It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults.
1.0 	 It is a complicated and emotional story for kids.
0.52 	 There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic", because that was the easiest way of explaining it.
0.58 	 Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look, with its strangely darkened skies.
0.73 	 The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth.
0.81 	 It has people on it that look like humans.
0.96 	 The skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing.
1.0 	 The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is if we forget how to love.
0.74 	 It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.<br /><br />I unfortunately did not watch the end.
0.53 	 I hated it.
1.0 	 A very cocky "fixer" of sorts makes a nice idea.
1.0 	 Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable but nothing new.
0.96 	 This film is and always will be a PERMA-TURD.
1.0 	 The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so bad.
1.0 	 Should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated, ignore them... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music.
0.96 	 See this movie if you can, it may be light but it is still completely amusing.
1.0 	 No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused.
0.94 	 The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without dancing.
0.98 	 Give this film a chance even if you don't like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one.
0.85 	 No, it is not high art by any means.
0.95 	 Nor is the script anywhere close to a Woody Allen or Mel Brooks.
0.69 	 BUT SO WHAT!
0.98 	 Not much, really, except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and, having done that, has apparently dropped into obscurity.
0.91 	 John, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the Killer Tomatoes.<br /><br />The script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie.
0.75 	 And Mark Price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar Michael J Fox.
0.96 	 He's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban "cave".
1.0 	 Needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion.<br /><br />There's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script.
0.79 	 I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar, but they should have.
0.91 	 Of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant, so it's just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own.
1.0 	 Yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high-point.
0.63 	 Not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have.
0.92 	 An unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he starts dwelling on thoughts of decay, even imagining it where there isn't any, and also equating decay with corruption of society in general.
0.74 	 Having witnessed his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) getting it on with their pool boy, he determines to punish her.
0.99 	 At the same time, he's under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S.
0.98 	 Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre, trying not to let anyone see.
0.99 	 The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue.
0.86 	 Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us.
0.61 	 Must have been '70 when I saw it.
0.69 	 All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight.
0.84 	 Who be the next Napoleon then?
0.73 	 Benjamin?!
0.51 	 !
0.99 	 Show some effort in your work.
0.75 	 Give me a break.
0.75 	 The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town.
0.98 	 Robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul.
0.97 	 Instead Clay makes Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd.
0.98 	 One wonders how much experience of real life this young director has.
1.0 	 Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control.
0.96 	 The film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits.
0.94 	 The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern male.
1.0 	 This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it is his last.
0.92 	 The problem is that it is TOO intense.
0.99 	 That is the risk you take in modern action films.
0.56 	 This is way overdone.<br /><br />Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a "B" film.
0.97 	 The best part of it is Scheider's dialog: the only "A" part of this "B" film.<br /><br />The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes.
1.0 	 One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines.
1.0 	 That was memorable.
1.0 	 Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested.
0.98 	 She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance.
0.58 	 Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park?
0.99 	 A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples.
0.97 	 Or where they designed to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope so).
0.51 	 The whole was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part.
1.0 	 at first you don't know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film.
1.0 	 until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school.
0.95 	 until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods.
0.56 	 they is a lot to say about this movie.
0.73 	 they burn all there stuff.
0.95 	 in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into I'm not saying its right but many people do do things like that.<br /><br />and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film.<br /><br />so thats my review on zero day.<br /><br />and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up.
0.71 	 I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time, or my friend's.
0.51 	 I think this story is not worth telling.
0.98 	 I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn.
0.95 	 The director is not a great actress, though she did a lot of movies in Holland, and the young woman who took the main part is a TV-personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism.
0.88 	 I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing.
0.76 	 Everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting.
0.68 	 It gets it's meaning across.
0.91 	 All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie.
0.73 	 It never fails to enthrall me.
0.56 	 Gunga Din, anti-Nazi tract?
0.77 	 Not quite.
0.99 	 The Fat Dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "Condors", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor.
0.95 	 The kidnappers happen to be former business partners of the son's father and are looking to exact some revenge on him.
0.96 	 Once you've figured out what is going on, the engaging Maria Schneider (as Michelle) and endearing John Whittington (as Boots) can get you through the film.
0.98 	 There are a couple of female nude scenes, which fit into the storyline well.<br /><br />**** Wanted: Babysitter (10/15/75) RenÃ© ClÃ©ment ~ Maria Schneider, John Whittington, Vic Morrow
0.97 	 Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /><br />Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /><br />Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <br /><br />Review: <br /><br />To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning.
0.9 	 And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead.
0.55 	 These things are raking in the dough!
0.74 	 So Zombie 3 was born.
0.96 	 The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we've seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead.
0.82 	 Canister gets released into the general population and shebang!
0.98 	 First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick.
0.81 	 The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4).
0.99 	 They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good.
0.62 	 And god love them, they did.<br /><br />And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its "director".
0.86 	 Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there's a lot of gore and guts involved.<br /><br />Here we get neither!
0.87 	 Well there's some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people.
0.98 	 That was cool.
0.98 	 In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn't even take it to seriously.
0.58 	 And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick.
1.0 	 And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies.
0.87 	 And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films.
0.88 	 It's our prom'.
0.51 	 (P.S.
0.83 	 JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing.
0.95 	 The climactic ending is a bit ludicrous, but JUST CAUSE is worth a look on a slow night.
0.94 	 Kubrick meets King.
0.56 	 It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, I remember.
0.6 	 Then the movie came out, and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since.<br /><br />The King cultists say Stanley Kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it.
0.61 	 They talk about Steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.This is a film, they insist: It should be considered on its own.
0.99 	 The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.)
0.95 	 has a reputation as an novelist of social manners.
0.97 	 Maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics.
1.0 	 But the little blue-collar town of Sidewinder, Colorado doesn't exist on any map in her Francophile universe.
0.93 	 <br /><br />Kubrick the Anglophile probably found her congenial, however.
0.96 	 He, of course, is the real auteur.
0.81 	 Or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father?
0.85 	 One notes how whenever Jack Torrance is seen talking to a "ghost" he is in fact looking into a mirror.
0.99 	 Are we to seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness stems from a some sort of "past life" experience?
1.0 	 Maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror.
0.67 	 Whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways, rational and supernatural.
0.97 	 and "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!")
0.8 	 merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy.
0.59 	 (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: "Whew!
0.97 	 Yikes, now I really am afraid.<br /><br />Given Jack Nicholson's brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling, eyebrow-wiggling, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted.
0.98 	 The performance of Shelley Duvall, as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken," is best passed over in silence.<br /><br />This movie simply doesn't succeed -- not as an adaptation, not on its own terms.
0.99 	 Karishma Kapoor is an actress i hate, this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes.
0.58 	 This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama.
0.75 	 Well done!
0.77 	 The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story.
0.55 	 The film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like "Seven Samurai" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the "townsfolk" finally find their backbone and want to help.
0.92 	 And I'm not talking about the glossy, glamour version of Hollywood violence.
1.0 	 The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate.
0.85 	 You know a movie will not go well when John Carradine narrates (a.k.a.
1.0 	 The narration is his character's last will & testament.
0.98 	 It stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants.
1.0 	 If all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants.
1.0 	 To be eligible, they must live in the family estate for a week.
0.95 	 You will be happy to still be alive, but the pain might be too great to bear alone.
0.85 	 Share children, share.<br /><br />-Celluloid Rehab
0.7 	 Curiously, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth--not Buddy the Gorilla's-- that emerge as the focal point of "Buddy", a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope.
1.0 	 Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life.
0.96 	 The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity.
0.74 	 The movie never sparkles with the kind of "family film" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real).
0.99 	 But, at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up.
0.81 	 <br /><br />There are some good ideas though.
0.93 	 Some of the comic elements are actually efficient, especially the opening scene.
0.96 	 <br /><br />The trailer I saw was very dynamic, that is not true for the film.
0.97 	 Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved.
0.97 	 The theater setting for a slasher film predates Soavi's film of the same name and Argento's OPERA (both of which are better than this one ) by five years though, and Neumann is pretty hot.
0.99 	 "Three Daring Daughters" is a sickly sweet, rose-colored look at divorce, remarriage, and single-parent living.
1.0 	 Obviously, social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise, and then dates and marries a band conductor.
0.68 	 <br /><br />Admittedly, this movie was released in the nineteen forties.
0.52 	 Only a love for old style Hollywood romance and comedy could make 'Daughters' a tolerable film.
1.0 	 It's kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece.
1.0 	 It is a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more from a film.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.92 	 but there is much poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere.<br /><br />One thing further to be said is that it documents a mid-century English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality.
1.0 	 Having grown up in America just a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense.
1.0 	 The concept isn't always successful, let alone plausible, but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy.
0.96 	 Barely set up for the night, they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children, the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh.
0.72 	 "The Forest" is a weird and unusual film, to say the least.
1.0 	 It's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting, but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open-minded fans of 80's horror.
0.96 	 The murders are fairly gruesome and will-filmed, including a slit throat and a painful saw-massacre, and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful.
0.82 	 The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists, the less it makes any sense, so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer.
0.8 	 I don't watch soaps.
0.58 	 I made fun of them it when I was ten (it was so easy).<br /><br />But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way.
0.91 	 I found the story pretty damn funny.
0.96 	 The fashions of the 80's - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just top it off.
0.99 	 The huge hair, the high heels, and the histrionics - what a combination.<br /><br />And all the actors just go to town, chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile.
0.59 	 And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film?
1.0 	 ).<br /><br />Admittedly, I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe.
0.96 	 Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times?, as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don't know who and I'm so done with it now, I could spit peanuts if I had them.
0.9 	 Gabriel, it seems, is just a little more than freaked out by the possibility to be drafted, and so in his own radical mind-state he does what he can to keep out.
0.98 	 <br /><br />But what drags down the film is that elements involving the characters aren't explained to the degree one might wish more.
0.99 	 Gabriel is perturbed by what's going on in Vietnam, but what else is there?
0.56 	 I feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues.<br /><br />In contrast to the other comment, I do not think this movie is anything like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick flick.
1.0 	 The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis.'
0.7 	 It looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station, just prior to demolition.
0.85 	 However, it's made me think so much.
1.0 	 I have tried to give mumblecore a chance, but lets be honest its just horrible.<br /><br />I am not out of sync with cinema, I appreciate Dogme95 films, Idioterne is one of my all time favorite films.
0.8 	 He's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e.
1.0 	 one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion (or, more accurately, by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God), but that said he never looks at its positive side.
1.0 	 She's dead now of course, but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries, which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills, get their tattoos removed, and to become responsible members of society, or he could visit USC's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies, which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians, diplomats, and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day.
0.96 	 Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies.
0.9 	 Serrault's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then later....<br /><br />The "message" of GARDE A VUE, if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to, if necessary, close cases at the expense of justice.
0.67 	 If you can find this movie you are indeed lucky.
0.95 	 Mainly because he simply doesn't understand things, like why his father is hardly ever there for him.
0.53 	 There is the American Indian legend, but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it, it is explained to him like bluntly and simplistically.
0.81 	 And the final question the film asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there?
0.56 	 I got to see this just this last Friday at the Los Angeles film festival at Laemlee's on Beverly.
0.54 	 I thought the main actor demon guy was really good.
1.0 	 Either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short.
0.95 	 The girl did an okay job.
0.92 	 We won't even talk about the last film in the block which I left.
0.99 	 And only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation.
0.99 	 After murdering several hundred men, women and children, Seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts.
0.85 	 Buried alive, he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch.
0.75 	 Needless to say, more gruesome murders ensue...
1.0 	 By doing this they will change the world forever- Gryll and Jed's music will never be made leaving a world of war, famine, and hatred, and more annoyingly, bland boy/girl group pop music.
0.87 	 In the words of Kenneth Reeves- 'Wow!'
0.89 	 There are at least 6.
1.0 	 The 1963 version of "The Haunting" has been one of my favorite horror films for years, so I anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of trepidation.
0.94 	 It hardly seemed that any follow-up could exceed or even equal the original masterpiece.
0.77 	 Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again (as she did in "Entrapment") that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her.
0.93 	 The female lead, who did great in an episode of "The X-Files," looks lost here as Eleanor, an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity.
0.99 	 I don't think he changes expression once during the entire film.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />The reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the manifestations were a result of Eleanor's precarious mental state.
0.99 	 No spirits are actually seen in the original, leaving much up to the imagination--a hallmark of other great horror films like "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project."
0.95 	 The f/x aren't even that great, considering they were done by ILM.
0.96 	 The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson film "The Frighteners," which I saw just before this one, were a lot better.
0.84 	 3/10 stars.
0.9 	 I am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much.
1.0 	 Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which Wendy was striving to win.
0.9 	 It all ends like a typical feel good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end.
1.0 	 This star-studded British/Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see of it.
0.67 	 Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have.
0.56 	 There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and that's it.
0.58 	 And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics I've never heard before.
0.92 	 On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, some nice scenery-chewing by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas.
0.88 	 I will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then.
0.73 	 Much much better than 90% of the Scream rip-offs out there!
0.91 	 Witty.
0.91 	 Quirky.
0.94 	 Genuine.
0.95 	 Surreal.
0.95 	 Butterfly wings?
1.0 	 One could ask what all of these words best describe, and some (those in fuse with the international film community) may quickly say Happenstance, but others may jump aboard the more American train and immediately yell, The Butterfly Effect.
0.96 	 Sure, we all loved her in Amelie and thought she was the daughter of Jesus in The Da Vinci Code, but in this film first-time director (of a feature film at least) Laurent Firode doesn't give Tautou the opportunity to shine.
0.76 	 Sadly, he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of "random chance" to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer (never a true boil).
0.95 	 Firode has ample, and I use "ample" as a small word, moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story, a genuinely whimsical fairy-tale of love and coincidence, but instead he fell face-first into a mud-bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.<br /><br />Tautou's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box, but do not be so taken immediately as I did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into Tautou's French cinema.
1.0 	 Firode's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly (albeit confusing) ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing "melodrama".
0.75 	 Firode fails by giving us, the audience, too many characters.
0.98 	 With too many characters he gives us too many random interventions, and by the end you don't really care who is who, or what is what, or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival.
0.91 	 It just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.<br /><br />Firode fails because he focus' so intently on the minor details that, for one of those rare film occurrences, he actually forgets the central focus.
0.85 	 I can say that there was no defined central focus to Happenstance.
0.98 	 In the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight, but we never go back to that throughout the film.
0.72 	 I don't need my hand held through films.<br /><br />I will give this film one star for credit.
0.98 	 This is a rather difficult genre to master successfully.
0.99 	 Time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for, but with Happenstance it works because Firode semi-explores the different avenues.
0.97 	 While I will counter with saying that he does not do it well, it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment.
0.94 	 I think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken.
0.94 	 Marketing is something that I didn't mention before, but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an Amelie 2 (per the title released in Hong Kong), and why would you place Tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all.
0.69 	 <br /><br />The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are actually outraged that people making their beaded necklaces were getting paid like $0.10 per hour to do so.
0.96 	 You also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the bead factory, but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and/or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor.<br /><br />I have wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how completely grueling and arduous it would be to make them.
0.83 	 And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
0.84 	 This is a sad state of affairs.
0.92 	 The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night lineup.
0.99 	 Whatever happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis, and BSG on Friday nights?
0.81 	 The basic premise of "Miami Golem" most definitely deserves a spot in the top, say, fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down!
0.99 	 I was prepared from something convoluted, because the film was directed and co-written by Alberto De Martino, who was one of Italy's most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers.
1.0 	 Not all of De Martino's films are worthwhile, but some of them are extremely underrated, like "A Special Magnum for Tony Saitta", "Holocaust 2000" and "Formula for a Murder".
1.0 	 The concept of "Miami Golem" contains elements from numerous great Sci-Fi and adventure flicks (like "Alien", "Starman" , "Close encounters of the Third Kind", "ET", 
) but I wouldn't exactly call it a rip-off.
1.0 	 It certainly doesn't always make sense (most of the time it doesn't, actually) but "Miami Golem" is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and I fascinated from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but I'll try anyway.
0.92 	 With the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise, Craig Milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus.
0.94 	 Laura Trotter is probably the least sexy female lust-object ever, and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic VHS cover must have felt exactly the same way, because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie.
1.0 	 And, finally, there's the unforgettable scene where David Warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol!
0.71 	 I don't think even John Rambo can do this, while he's a beefcake Vietnam veteran and Warbeck's character is a simple TV-reporter.
0.95 	 Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to a planet, assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there, since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours.
0.97 	 There is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like:<br /><br />McCoy- Where did they go?
0.82 	 Atoz- Wherever they wanted to.<br /><br />The misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily, but for plot purposes, it isn't, and soon Kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are sent to an ice age, 5000 years in the planet's past.
0.52 	 Yes, you heard me.
0.99 	 The stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better.
1.0 	 The color was wrong, they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be.
0.96 	 How can someone NOT like this movie???
0.54 	 !....I mean he took the Carrot and he...well you know HAHAHA..How is that NOT funny?
0.72 	 Anyway, the plot focuses on Gino Costa, a handsome drifter who, by chance, stumbles upon a cafÃ© where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works.
0.92 	 He soon learns that she's married to Giuseppe; a big fat annoying man, whom Giovanna can't stand to have even touching her.
1.0 	 Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much, however, and with a running time of almost 135 minutes, I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length.
0.63 	 I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film, but it's not a 'great' film.
0.88 	 There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on, and by not always focusing on the characters themselves; the film is not as interesting as it could have been.
0.74 	 I've heard that before - where?
0.94 	 It's "Waltz No.
0.69 	 What a treat!
0.96 	 As a fan of Glenne Healdy's, I was surprised of her british accent.
0.94 	 The only exception for this film was the ending.
0.93 	 The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N.
0.69 	 The broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making.<br /><br />What's surprising and disappointing about WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clichÃ©s of Hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film formulas.
0.99 	 While Vipul Shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in AANKHEN, he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of WAQT that is based on something as conceivable as a father-son relationship.
0.93 	 If you are not one of the two, you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life.<br /><br />Add to it director Vipul Shah's easy handling of the screenplay.
0.84 	 With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker.
1.0 	 Ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation.
1.0 	 What with the director forcing in song-n-dance every now and then in the first half.
0.52 	 Out of reason!
0.99 	 and the audience Out of seat.<br /><br />The film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half.
1.0 	 The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements.
1.0 	 The much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either.
1.0 	 However Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous.
0.88 	 Imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this (unintentionally) hilarious histrionic.
0.92 	 Also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son.<br /><br />Anu Malik's music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings.
0.89 	 After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly enjoyed watching "Fried Worms".
0.98 	 For once, I did not guess the ending!
0.99 	 "He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!"
0.78 	 With this movie, they've made a good effort at achieving that title.
1.0 	 The Scarecrow going around killing people isn't the least bit enjoyable.
1.0 	 Some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it.<br /><br />Pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely.
0.97 	 The wardrobe and set was surprisingly good.
0.64 	 It had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow, this film is finally going some place, then the credits roll.
0.98 	 Good grief.
0.85 	 <br /><br />I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting.
0.96 	 Actually, that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well.
0.69 	 All of what you see was the desired effect.
0.84 	 Perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before, although that's what sets it apart.
0.81 	 The plot really isn't all that hard to follow, if you actually focus on what's going on.
0.82 	 Maybe it's just me because I see movies from many different aspects such as the acting, the plot, etc.
0.56 	 I'm no "interpreter" or anything who picks movies apart, it just comes to me.
1.0 	 A particularly funny moment is when one member finds out his home is gone, and becomes homeless, leaving Randy no choice but to shoot him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the four boys set out to solve the problem, with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message, but being seriously uninspired.
0.94 	 Matt and Trey played it safe this week, and didn't really critique the homeless problem, just lampooned it.<br /><br />The shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist shoots himself in an attempt to avoid the homeless.
0.99 	 This is the first time a suicide on South Park goes wrong, and we watch the poor man miss his brain and then attempt to shoot himself many times while he painfully dies.
0.73 	 (Though capable of mind control and zapping objects from afar, it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons.)
0.91 	 The script clomps from event to event,leaving puzzlers aplenty.
0.6 	 Inquiring minds want to know!
0.65 	 Writer-director Mario Gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming a stack of UFO-themed tabloids as he took in a Sunn Classics double feature.
0.83 	 Watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman's "The Player," when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers.
0.55 	 The direction must have been "you're lonely, pout for me."
0.98 	 I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks.
0.87 	 It's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, "made in Canada," ha ha.
0.95 	 The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color.
1.0 	 this movie was fantastic great movie all through scary as hell.
0.66 	 RIGHT!
0.67 	 right?
0.68 	 its a movie yes but most evil movies or praised movies like this are meant to make sense but it didn't.
0.99 	 The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile.
0.82 	 It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment.
0.59 	 I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks.
0.93 	 Genius!
0.75 	 Let me put it another way: balls.
1.0 	 Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard.
0.63 	 I have lost count of the number of versions going around.
0.8 	 If you haven't seem EMMA, I'll only say that self-sufficient Emma does get her comeuppance.
0.79 	 They could almost have had a psychic connection to old Jane!
0.52 	 After watching it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life really was.
0.99 	 I like romantic comedies sometimes.
0.91 	 It's not something you are going to do all the time, but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being.
0.79 	 I know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy, but you usually don't really care because you are laughing.
0.72 	 Sure, this is how all movies work, but you shouldn't notice that it's happening.
0.51 	 Inelegant.
0.68 	 That's the term I should use.<br /><br />There was almost no one in the movie who was really likable.
0.63 	 Also, almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation.
0.51 	 A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out (and bathe with) with a woman he is attracted to?
1.0 	 Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, appealing women.
0.97 	 1st the good news.
0.87 	 The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story: Buzz Aldrin.<br /><br />And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLIES, for krissakes!
0.76 	 Flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless.
0.53 	 This one's got even less empathy going for it.
0.98 	 ...may seem like an overstatement, but it is not.<br /><br />What is so hard to comprehend is - why didn't they make more musical shorts like this?
0.96 	 I guess not.
0.71 	 This is one exception - the only one?
1.0 	 Crazy, man.<br /><br />A pity there were no sequels.
0.95 	 I saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time... What stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say.
0.65 	 This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through... they don't break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.<br /><br />These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they're not that different.
0.99 	 Anyway, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and had to watch it again... sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.<br /><br />Now, what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness.
0.78 	 Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes.
0.92 	 I guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.<br /><br />Considering the target audience, who I'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues...
0.97 	 Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt.
0.89 	 I'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers.
0.88 	 The plot such as it is involved young Susan Berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there.
0.74 	 No wonder he's not gone anywhere.<br /><br />I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar East Village locations where the film was mostly shot.
0.81 	 I'll stick to Bing Crosby.
0.81 	 "How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities.
0.99 	 It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities.
0.95 	 Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title.
0.97 	 He is uproarious, daring, and moronic.
0.85 	 This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on "eye candy" material.
0.9 	 However, I think that Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison; even though Team Weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise.
0.83 	 But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here.
1.0 	 (It should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous CGI creatures flitting around on their ankle wings, or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis.
0.97 	 As in Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary).<br /><br />It's a pity it's not available in DVD, especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the Odyssey that one can find in video stores.
0.6 	 <br /><br />If you like Werewolf films I strongly recommend these: Werewolf of London (1935), The Wolf Man (1941), Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), House of Frankenstein (1944), Abbott an d Costell Meets Frankenstein (1948), The Curse of the Werewolf (1961), An American Werewolf in London (1981), Silver Bullet (1985), Werewolf (1987), The Monster Squad (1987), My Mom's a Werewolf (1989), Project: Metalbeast (1995), Bad Moon (1996), Werewolf (1996), Dog Soldiers (2002), Underworld (2003), and Van Helsing (2004)!
0.92 	 The plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity, the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and cheesy in all the right places.
0.99 	 Very funny to watch "Beretta's Island" as kind of natural trash-film.It is like answer to Jess Franko's type of b-movie.Bodybuilders strikes back (!face to face!)
0.98 	 Nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes.
0.93 	 Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breaking-up phone connection just eludes me; shouldn't she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in?
0.54 	 Besides, what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the FBI does investigations.
0.64 	 Quite the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which is from Domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.<br /><br />The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle.
1.0 	 I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (Chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example).
1.0 	 I've laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even enjoyed him in Dude Where's My Car?.
0.99 	 Nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining.
0.8 	 Perhaps the MTV writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the President from Air Force One.
0.98 	 And would someone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody?
1.0 	 The guy looks 30, trying to act 19 again....give it up, show some class (like in your best actor academy award speech) and act your age!<br /><br />I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the speech by Gollam for Best Visual Performance.
1.0 	 This was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening.
0.99 	 I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work.
0.91 	 An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.<br /><br />The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold.
0.9 	 I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4).
1.0 	 Especially for such an overhyped film.
0.83 	 Clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it.
0.99 	 It didn't even bother me Jolie appeared so little.
0.99 	 CAMILLE 2000 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Panavision)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst visiting Rome, an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovo's wealthy father (Massimo Serato), and Fate deals a tragic blow...<br /><br />A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas' 'La Dame aux Camelias') by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who, along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of 'Adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's.
0.98 	 Production values are handsome throughout, and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync dubbing.
0.97 	 Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees.
0.7 	 Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed.
1.0 	 Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.
0.53 	 this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production.
1.0 	 <br /><br />A second good point....this would make a great date movie.
0.53 	 This is the first movie set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th Century other than serials such as "Flash Gordon".
0.95 	 it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline.
0.72 	 The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language.
1.0 	 Still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release), I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and, the "General Lee" is still good to go.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Hunky cousins Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage.
0.54 	 Of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams.<br /><br />If you watched Long Way Round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly I find more amusing than offensive.<br /><br />I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie's hair, but he had it styled before Dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged; tho' I could have lived without the 'flame' undies lol As with LWR, the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself.
0.84 	 I nearly cried when Charlie broke his hand, and winced at every bruise he sustained while training....and of course the death of Andy Caldicott...that was an appalling tragedy, but then every year there's something.<br /><br />Russ drives me nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in LWR.
0.93 	 - they had months to prepare the X5, and still the day before the team left for Lisbon, Scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race; 2. the Dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider/driver retrieval plan - leaving Matt (and presumably a large number of other riders/drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence; 3.
0.94 	 I went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession.
0.98 	 I was not expecting much of anything.
0.95 	 After all, a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer?
0.9 	 <br /><br />Wrong!!
0.81 	 The story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up Hollywood special effects.
0.54 	 As the credits roll by, you suddenly realize you were glued until the end.<br /><br />At times, the acting seems a little over the top.
0.82 	 Otherwise, I wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed.<br /><br />It's worth seeing more than once.
0.98 	 I find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something I either missed or forgot about the first time or two around.<br /><br />I completely recommend this movie.
0.69 	 Whoa there!
0.99 	 A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years.
1.0 	 He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he becomes attracted with her ability.
0.98 	 His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor.
1.0 	 But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega.
0.77 	 This low-budget movie does not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes.
1.0 	 Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family?
0.73 	 Or was a clash of classes, and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes?
0.94 	 My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Um Astro em Minha Vida" ("A Star in My Life")
0.53 	 Sometimes the pace bogs down, but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story.
0.82 	 Make room for some Oscars!
0.69 	 Lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids.
0.55 	 In this movie characters can DIE, and be sent to HELL!
0.94 	 She fits the role of lead Ruby like a glove, almost as if she didn't have to act.
0.62 	 Let me be clear.
0.64 	 For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters.
0.99 	 The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play.
0.62 	 THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION.
0.99 	 I don't doubt any second that there are people who'll like this sense of "humor", but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers.
0.91 	 I'm working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: At the movies it was a nice (but no big at all) success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast.
0.64 	 In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore.
0.83 	 Why?
0.63 	 They're kids and they act like kids would.
1.0 	 <br /><br />They're blunt, awkward and annoyingly confused about everything.
1.0 	 Yes, this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I don't think so.
1.0 	 Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying, but she was pregnant and a teenagers?
1.0 	 The plot was VERY predictable and but so what?
0.97 	 I believed them, his stress and inability to cope - her brave, yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together.
0.98 	 I think the characters, acted by anyone else, WOULD indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't.
1.0 	 I felt angry at her for that, I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her.
0.53 	 I just wish they'd release it on DVD because I'm wearing my tape version out!
1.0 	 This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized.
0.59 	 I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation.
0.74 	 <br /><br />The picture is an interesting and deliberate whodunit,it's a laborious and intriguing suspense tale.The personages are similar to Agatha Christie stories, all they are various suspects.They are developed on a whole gallery of familiar actors well characterized from the period represented by a glittering casting to choose from their acting range from great to worst.
0.89 	 Harry Callahan himself is dirtier than ever.
0.77 	 Not afraid to make use of his 44.
0.87 	 This episode apparently grew out of the cold war.
0.88 	 There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed.
0.6 	 Here are some of Slavoj utterances (most as paraphrases): "desire is a wound on reality", "fantasy realized is a nightmare", "music is the opium of the people" (borrowing from K. Marx), "of all human emotions, anxiety is the only one that is not deceiving".
1.0 	 For the theater goer it is irrelevant.
0.8 	 Among the cast, Sam Raimi, director of "THE EVIL DEAD" films and "The Gift", appears here as Arkin's bumbling right-hand man.
0.61 	 Saw it as many times as I could before it left the scene.
0.77 	 Only wish I could find it again!
0.92 	 Would certainly buy/view it if I could.
0.51 	 But once I saw this, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather".
0.95 	 "Santa Claus" is a jolly film about Santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels demonic watching it.
0.96 	 Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that I'm sure has turned many kids off of Christmas.
0.6 	 The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits along with all of the performances and dialog.
0.99 	 Santa lives high above Earth in the North Pole where he, and kids from all around the world get ready for Christmas.
0.97 	 Santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in Mexico.
0.55 	 Probably one of the strangest scenes is Santa shooting Pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while Pitch dances around in pain.
0.79 	 The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore.
0.83 	 If you think this sounds interesting, think again.
0.88 	 The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed... you name it.
0.99 	 Only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all.
0.96 	 But even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion, and, when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end, sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one's shoes wet.
0.93 	 As a police detective, Dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked, but he possesses a mean-streak that he can't escape.
0.83 	 Gary Merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss Scalise, but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role, and I think that an actor like Richard Conte (who played Mr. Brown in 'The Big Combo (1955)') would have better suited the character; I hadn't realised this, but Conte appeared just one year earlier in Preminger's 'Whirlpool (1949).
0.99 	 The taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified Dixon as the perpetrator, but Preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes Dixon on the stairs.
0.51 	 And why, for that matter, couldn't the taxi driver's testimony have immediately absolved Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully) from suspicion of murder?
0.89 	 I had an open mind.
1.0 	 Just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy.
0.77 	 This is one of them.
0.69 	 I know, I know it's a comedy.
0.97 	 But I was just not impressed.
0.66 	 <br /><br />2/10
0.8 	 Not really a big box office draw, but I was pleasently surprised<br /><br />with this movie.
0.98 	 To say that Pacino went over-the-top in here would be an understatement.
0.79 	 Sure at times Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all.
0.51 	 Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there.
0.73 	 When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised.
0.99 	 The music was a little bit too 80s-ish for me but it didn't annoy me.
0.89 	 He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and self consumed.
0.55 	 Yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster.
0.62 	 A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface.<br /><br />The good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the Tony Montanas' are not the real problem.
0.97 	 If we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't.
1.0 	 He is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it.
0.51 	 The Tony Montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society.
1.0 	 This in no way excuses people like him.
1.0 	 Instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer.
0.53 	 Despite being made in the early Seventies, it certainly doesn't look particularly dated.
0.79 	 This seems to be generally overlooked (yet in retrospect quite understandably so).
0.93 	 We know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are, like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell.
0.99 	 The conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic.
0.98 	 There are no demons or bogeymen here.
0.97 	 The predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists.
0.97 	 They shock because their evil is petty and tangible.
0.72 	 The film has no peripheral characters.
0.86 	 To conclude, I must speculate as to if and when 'Deliverance' author James Dickey's 'To the White Sea' will be made.
0.98 	 There was the suggestion a few years ago that the Coen brothers might be producing it, but that eventually came to nothing.
1.0 	 Being an avid Coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on TTWS, rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts.
0.99 	 Returning to 'Deliverance', it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest, unnerving brutality being made in these times, and that is pretty shameful.
0.97 	 We, the cinema-going public, are all the poorer for this.
0.99 	 I really thought they did an *excellent* job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, I don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible, it moved me to tears (I guess it moved about everyone to tears) but I try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one got me.
0.81 	 Compared to that, I feel like our own trials are nothing.
0.99 	 Well, not nothing, but they hardly match what they had to go through.
1.0 	 He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too.
0.9 	 We all have seen some unending epics in our times, but this one really tops them all!
0.56 	 At almost 4 hours length, it could have rather been made into a tele-serial.<br /><br />What starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace.
0.97 	 Nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them...
0.69 	 But they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters.
0.85 	 and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records, beyond a point of sorting them out, so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie...<br /><br />Watch it only if you want to test your patience!!
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama, but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles, rough fist-fights, lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity!
1.0 	 Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes?
0.65 	 Well, Bo does that to his sister and, judging by her dubbed laughter, she doesn't mind at all.
0.61 	 Sick, dude!
0.99 	 Most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause (and I bet the actors understood even less) but whatever!
0.96 	 The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded.
0.72 	 The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly Â and I won't reveal for what reason Â Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes.
0.98 	 Bo's principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent, the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film, there's the obligatory "we're-falling-in-love" montage and loads of other attractions!
0.99 	 There, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter.
0.82 	 I give this movie a 9.5, because, I am very picky when it comes to books to movies, (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY).
0.94 	 Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite by way of a nasty English fog preventing travel.
0.65 	 And she falls for him.
0.94 	 To make matters worse, and more amusing, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear Larry thinks must be Oberon!
0.5 	 This was filmed in early Technicolour that looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than Michael Jackson), but perhaps the print needs cleaning up.
0.6 	 Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />So I'm posting my corrections out of my frustration: -The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia.
0.54 	 -Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit.
0.98 	 but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />That was all.. Lenge leve Norge !
0.51 	 then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it.
0.96 	 Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story.<br /><br />To have a chance at obtaining an education, Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy, anyway.
0.68 	 I actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it.
0.99 	 He interviews her on her yacht.
0.85 	 Davis and Brent carry the picture.
0.78 	 Though it's fairly predictable, it is also fairly entertaining.
1.0 	 It's far from her best.
0.83 	 Seen today, some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are, but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation.
1.0 	 About the only serious negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and "nuts" like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably won't notice.
0.74 	 I did watch it for over 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off.<br /><br />The best part of it was William Shatner dancing on the stage.
0.78 	 I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end.
0.85 	 The creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments, little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies, and even a scene ripped from the pages of Wile E. Coyote!<br /><br />Don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people- this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking, and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they won't know they're being mocked..).<br /><br />-Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get a 'Zag-nut' bar....<br /><br />-Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ/entertainer
0.83 	 Most of us, I suspect.
0.92 	 is not a movie about dancing.
1.0 	 He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule.
1.0 	 It is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race, which is thrilling.
0.68 	 Although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed, in several screen shots, it does have a sense of; getting the "nitty gritty" out of the way, focusing on those key relationships which make "office politics" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used purely for comic effect.
1.0 	 T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions.
0.9 	 Rekha is good, but then - she's always good, and here she's nothing more than such.
1.0 	 She makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that.
0.92 	 In conclusion, nothing great at all.
0.76 	 There were far too many to mention them here but I have to say two which struck me as particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona (i.e.
0.92 	 Considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and I even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound.
0.76 	 This movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all.
0.98 	 I'm amazed that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended.
0.72 	 Christ.
0.59 	 and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.
1.0 	 This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever.
0.87 	 Me and some friends then watched it, admittedly whilst rather drunk.
0.97 	 It soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film.
0.97 	 At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered.
1.0 	 We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed, this wasn't a work of abysmal film.
0.74 	 I actually didn't start watching the show until it came on FX.
0.95 	 I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it.
0.57 	 I was so upset that I had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v.
1.0 	 They would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid, but not That 70s Show.
0.67 	 She made a wise decision.
0.95 	 Brilliant technology.
0.85 	 <br /><br />George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you were well paid.
0.96 	 You might have even liked it.
0.93 	 Look at the comments.
0.67 	 In fact one almost can't help drawing comparisons to the last 'Prime Suspect', as one of the sub-plots focuses on a single, cynical female cop approaching retirement: and it's not just the absence of Helen Mirren that makes the comparisons unfavourable.
0.95 	 There's a lot of earnest over-emoting, manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic, in another suspicious.
0.95 	 But it's a sad sign that the BBC, which once made the likes of 'The Singing Detective', boasted of this of "possibly the best drama of the year": for there's little true originality on offer here, and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing.
0.75 	 Admittedly, I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure.
0.98 	 I hoped this film, of which I'd heard almost nothing growing up, would be a nice little gem.
0.99 	 An overlooked, ahead-of-its-time, intelligent and engaging city-political thriller.
0.96 	 It's not.<br /><br />City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters, names, and "realistic" citywide issues, that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating, that once you find out the truth, it will blow your mind.
1.0 	 And theoretically, this setup allows for some thrilling tension, the fear that none of the characters are safe, and anything could happen!
0.84 	 I don't think we're left with that in City Hall, and while it's a very full film, I don't find it altogether rich.
0.77 	 NBC used to air what appeared to be the "director's cut", with at least an hour of extra footage--mostly flashbacks--injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a "Gilligan's Island" episode.
0.71 	 Most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players have a little fun: Lee Grant is an obnoxious drunk, Brenda Vaccaro a no-nonsense stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting oldsters.
0.76 	 This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.<br /><br />This is the story of a cop (Om Puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer.
0.98 	 The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops.
0.92 	 <br /><br />This movie was a moderate box office hit.
0.61 	 After a dazzling opening shot, flick quickly settles into B-movie formula.
0.68 	 Sadly, this is also, where a major drawback of the movie is revealed.
0.83 	 The supporting cast is somehow similar, from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
0.87 	 I admire the effort (though slightly failed) on the attempt at showing the Christian people in a different way...even though they did that, the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish.
0.75 	 there you go.
0.96 	 The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless.
0.8 	 The estimable theater veteran Rosemary Harris (now better known as Peter Parker's aunt in the "Spider-Man" trilogy) has precious little time as the mother, as does Amy Ryan as Hank's bitter ex-wife.<br /><br />There are scenes that border on excessive, especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers, but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable.
0.69 	 Very, very odd.
0.8 	 If any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one.
1.0 	 However, the movie was terrible at editing.
0.59 	 The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs, yet they feel out of place.
0.97 	 Like Karisma is getting beat up, and the same time SRK is fighting (comically) with the police officers.
0.97 	 On top of that, the movie is overly glossy in the beginning.
0.99 	 The direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about.<br /><br />I have to say that the actors' were chosen very wisely.
0.97 	 Without them, this movie would not have an impact.
0.67 	 What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date.
0.88 	 Though she doesn't have much to say, her facial expressions and body language was good.
0.97 	 The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances.
0.92 	 Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do.
1.0 	 Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role.
0.95 	 And boy Aish is mad hot.
0.98 	 However, the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever.
0.91 	 People may have come to the movie for Aish, but they won't brag too much about it after-wards.
1.0 	 Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about.
0.97 	 Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie.
1.0 	 Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see.
0.6 	 They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events, excluding people, and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30's.
0.56 	 There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and W.D.
0.69 	 Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night.
1.0 	 Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt, with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong, independent lady-flier who's never been in love.
0.78 	 Intriguing early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, playing an Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix who's been too self-involved to give herself over to any man.
0.95 	 A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate-watchers.
0.83 	 Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys?
0.6 	 Then the fun really begins.<br /><br />The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously.
0.88 	 The camera work is OK for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for.
0.97 	 What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned?
0.97 	 The box art for the video markets it as a "fun throwback" to 1950s giant bug movies.
0.9 	 The annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth.
0.83 	 The boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats.<br /><br />The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location.
0.91 	 The rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness.<br /><br />Which brings us back to "ALIEN".
0.53 	 Problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous "foreboding tunnel" shots.
0.97 	 I take it "Blue Monkey" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag.
0.56 	 His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces (Adams's attempted post-incident assaults on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide-attempt confession).<br /><br />The quandary comes from the central protagonists' performances - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault (he'll end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary.
0.8 	 And it happened!
0.74 	 But she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman<br /><br />2.
0.98 	 That's what made the original zombie classics good.
0.99 	 Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.
0.99 	 Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.
0.87 	 Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good.
0.95 	 The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.
0.93 	 Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.
0.83 	 I dug this out and watched it tonight.
0.71 	 I honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time I saw it.
1.0 	 (Only 2 of them are among "the amazing 5".)
0.64 	 LACK OF MONEY in NO WAY explains what I saw on the screen!
1.0 	 The best thing I can say is, I think it would make a great double-feature with the 1966 BATMAN feature-- and probably a great triple-bill with that and the 1980 FLASH GORDON.
0.99 	 Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, The Lone Ranger-- all "murdered" by Hollywood types who think, "OH, comic-books!
0.93 	 Despite the script and the directing, Ron Ely is GREAT.
1.0 	 Bill Lucking (who later was a regular on THE A-TEAM) is terrific.
1.0 	 Eldon Quick (who I've seen somewhere else, but can't recall where) is terrific.
0.97 	 Paul Gleason-- who I absolutely HATED with a passion and a vengeance in THE BREAKFAST CLUB ("teachers" like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere), may be the best of the "amazing 5" in the film.
1.0 	 Pamela Hensley-- though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story-- is terrific.
0.79 	 Take yer pick.
0.99 	 (Ardala actually got plastic surgery in the George Tuska strips-- after, she was stunning!
0.94 	 )<br /><br />Paul Wexler, funny enough, I saw just last week in a GET SMART episode.
0.94 	 I don't know, because that character sure wasn't in the movie the film takes its title from.
0.54 	 The cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
0.93 	 When I read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a God, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, I though that was clever and original concept.
0.75 	 It can.
1.0 	 ), he's a man with a job he completely DESERVES (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and OH HORROR!!!!
0.91 	 Dog who is not house trained!!!
0.85 	 And what does Bruce do when God gives him his powers?
0.95 	 No, wait, a smart kid would probably use his God powers better than Bruce.
1.0 	 Pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!!
0.99 	 Not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!!
0.99 	 Aniston here is understated.
0.69 	 I would give three stars, but I doubt movie deserves a one.
0.99 	 But OK, there were few funny moments, and Freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.
0.72 	 After reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed.
1.0 	 Most importantly where is the lightness?!
0.99 	 From the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie.
0.67 	 I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here.
0.96 	 In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street, who is on his way to see Sabina.
0.57 	 The introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives Tomas' story more significance than it does make it light.<br /><br />There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is Kundera's style.
0.59 	 This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film.
0.99 	 The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman!<br /><br />Writer: That's great!
0.57 	 A work day is eight hours long.
0.91 	 When watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some sort of message.
0.81 	 Look at Morgan Freeman!"
0.95 	 Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery, the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident.
0.76 	 Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney (Corbin Bernsen of "The Dentist") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, Abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff.
0.77 	 The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons.
0.65 	 It's a real shame Eureka Video have stopped releasing this comical gold on DVD.
0.77 	 <br /><br />I have just bought Baseketball on DVD and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it.
0.95 	 <br /><br />P.s Does anybody think its weird for me to like them both?
0.7 	 hehe
0.86 	 This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes.
0.66 	 I have given this show (I have only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes/set-ups appear to fail.
0.56 	 She reminds me of that New York painter who throws paint upon a canvas, calls it art and sells it for a lot of money.
0.76 	 Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula?
0.97 	 They accidentally hit a deer while driving there.
0.98 	 This angers some of the locals--especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things slowly (VERY slowly) go wrong.<br /><br />I was expecting the worst when I started watching this.
0.84 	 The bulk of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative.
0.8 	 Well...I disagree.
0.93 	 First off it's NOT a horror film.
1.0 	 The horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes.
0.83 	 ); pretty good acting by Sullivan (only 10 at the time!)
0.6 	 and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic ending.<br /><br />I think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film--which it isn't.
0.86 	 So, if you can ignore that, I think you might like it.
0.55 	 I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan.
0.97 	 Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.<br /><br />One disappointment was the animation.
0.83 	 A not bad but also not so great heist film.
0.93 	 Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself.
0.94 	 Mayhem ensues.
0.76 	 Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan).
1.0 	 Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma.
1.0 	 The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance.
1.0 	 The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
1.0 	 It was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind.
0.61 	 It consists of two things.
0.71 	 This footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort.
0.54 	 It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies.
0.97 	 Most folks might say that if one were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie,you must be really bored.
0.81 	 Actually,I had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the TV and there it was,"Paulie".
0.93 	 As you know,if you don't already Paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner.
0.92 	 People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves.
0.98 	 Especially the owner of an animal research lab.
0.87 	 Paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of Paulie's vocal ability.<br /><br />Throughout the film Paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him,several other animals and finding the location of Paulie's owner.
0.94 	 <br /><br />8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown.
0.98 	 That part might bother younger children.
0.59 	 (END)
0.94 	 Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight singing star.
1.0 	 The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, "Evergreen."
0.98 	 Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star.
0.95 	 She is too confident, too professional.
0.99 	 And, the first episode, Broken Bow, did have some problems.
0.78 	 But, overall it was solid Trek material and a good romp.<br /><br />I'll get the nits out of the way first.
1.0 	 The opening theme is dull and I don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for.
1.0 	 What was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room.
0.92 	 They need to cut that nonsense out.<br /><br />But, the plot was strong and moved along well.
1.0 	 How did the Klingons go from just insulting to war?
0.6 	 How did the Federation form and just who put Earth in charge.
0.92 	 The comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn't get it.
0.92 	 The movie is campy- yes!
0.53 	 When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right.
1.0 	 In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in.
0.55 	 There are some laughs, but they are few and far between.
0.89 	 This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as "Anchorman" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.<br /><br />"Stripes" further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability.
1.0 	 Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis.
0.89 	 These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.<br /><br />Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in "Stripes" revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny (like I didn't) you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in "Stripes" funny either.<br /><br />"Stripes" is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching.
0.98 	 If you want to watch an early 80's "buddy" comedy I would recommend "Stir Crazy."
0.98 	 Like "Stripes" the humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes" it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.
1.0 	 You are wasting your time and life is short, go see the new Brangelina Jolie movie, have a good cry, go out & buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better, and leave us alone.<br /><br />Don't let the door hit you on the way out either.
0.77 	 THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is a grade B minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of Oklahoma by a young, TV friendly cast & crew, and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects, wakes up in a hospital, and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump.
1.0 	 But once he starts oozin' with Rick Baker's extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny, viscous blebs of grease.<br /><br />The film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points: There are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care, really.
0.87 	 The arid, cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same, and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that Cameron Mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in WITHOUT WARNING ... which also had a sick sense of humor, a TV friendly cast, and some pretty outrageous gore.
0.51 	 I definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies, as well as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is of no surprise considering that director Jonathan Demme is a part of MELTING MAN's cast.<br /><br />Essentially, as others have pointed out, this is a 1950s B movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects & the inevitable boobs.
0.86 	 Why can't people have made more movies like these?
0.99 	 This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me.
0.54 	 But some observations:<br /><br />1.
0.5 	 If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees?
0.92 	 The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary-schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary-school level of skill.
0.88 	 The movie "Holly" is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and smuggled across the border to Cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous "K11" red light village.
0.54 	 Patrick and Holly have an immediate bond over their "stubbornness", but this is all disrupted when Holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears.
0.92 	 A mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead, so Holly is then left on her own.
0.99 	 "I'm not trying to save 60,000," he tells her, "I'm trying to save one."
0.99 	 Patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior, but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world.
0.83 	 This enrages Patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar.
0.99 	 Eventually, Patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of Holly, who is hiding behind a pole.<br /><br />The movie "Holly" may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters, and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region, but the film's dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference.
0.55 	 I had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of Heaton.
0.84 	 My favourite scene had to be the bit where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the marsh and Spike runs off I generally thought Spike wasn't coming back.
0.84 	 I have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this I would have probably never seen it.
0.68 	 I am a huge John Denver fan.
0.94 	 it would have been better (although this of course was covered, I do not think it got as much time as it warranted).
1.0 	 <br /><br />And for many people who are not absolutely nuts about surfing, at times hearing them go on and on about specific locations and specific surfers could become boring.
0.82 	 It was far too tantalizing to myself to hear these stories, and then be unable to see them.
0.98 	 People are expected to suffer.
0.99 	 To get hurt.
0.98 	 To bleed.
0.97 	 And i think that what the film shows, isn't done for pure shock-value or presented in a distasteful way.
0.51 	 But sometimes, a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work.
0.65 	 And a great movie it is.<br /><br />The only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100% clear, and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie, it all made sense.
0.88 	 But it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story, so i still give this movie a 9.
0.85 	 Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes?
0.57 	 I'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for self-conscious parody.<br /><br />Splatter University is another film for the masochists in the audience.
0.79 	 Let's see if I can summarize.<br /><br />After learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital, the action moves to a Catholic university (I don't recall the name, but in honor of the title, let's call it St. Splatter).
0.87 	 It was good to see Ape the ape back, but wasn't as fun as the first, they should of had the new George as Georges son grown up, and still had Bredon and (whats her face) in the film, that would've been a bit better then it was.
0.63 	 I have copy of this on VHS, I think they (The television networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years.
0.91 	 This movie is as much fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive a city bus.<br /><br />John Hood, (Peebles) has just got out of prison and he's headed back to the old neighborhood.
0.97 	 In serving time for an all-to-nice crime of necessity, of course.
0.93 	 <br /><br />And please, watch responsibly.
1.0 	 If this is based on the true-life relationship, as purported, between Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I'm thrilled I do not know them personally.
0.8 	 Yes, that's absolutely right: the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless, goofball comedies {I'm not complaining; I've always been a fan} has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud.
0.61 	 When Alan and Charlie meet for the first time in years, the latter doesn't even recognise an old friend, having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life-crippling experience.
0.99 	 Indeed, at first he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of his family, and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling.<br /><br />Initially, it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device.
0.91 	 Yet it yielded one of their bigger hits It Never Entered My Mind.<br /><br />Nevertheless except for one minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the entire Broadway score was scrapped when RKO bought the film rights.
0.82 	 Only Michele starts looking at another.<br /><br />It's a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals, but RKO invested this film with a good cast of players.
0.94 	 Both of them were denounced by the president of the union, James C. Petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again.
0.74 	 I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan.
0.64 	 I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play.
0.61 	 The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less.
0.93 	 He can only fight when he's asleep - it's hysterical!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good.
0.9 	 Hence, I rate it "only" a 7 out of 10.
0.92 	 I wouldn't be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was.
0.94 	 Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd.
0.94 	 Still, part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba.
0.98 	 It's clear Soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past.
0.86 	 To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted.
0.99 	 The country's treasury was left empty.
0.95 	 Loony Tunes have ventured (at least) twice into the future.
1.0 	 The first time was with the brilliantly funny "Duck Dodgers".
1.0 	 WB cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor, appealing at least as much to adults as to children.
0.96 	 What's confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count-up to 2772 from the 21st Century.
0.85 	 And of course these guys are the only characters that laugh Â the usual evil laugh, of course.
0.87 	 Animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and (occasionally) their henchpeople and/or henchthings.<br /><br />In point of fact, the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get-go.
0.97 	 The superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities, but sometimes not.
0.59 	 Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as "Bugs-like".
0.69 	 What we have here is basically the silly and drekish "Teen Titans", including its overly "modern" animation "look", but with animals.
0.76 	 Adding to the fun could have been, say, Jupiter Sam Â as well as The Fudd, still hunting wabbits Â as well as Tech E. Coyote converted into a really neurotic villain Â and so on.
0.7 	 Ah, the sadness of missed opportunities
.<br /><br />Sadly, this whole production has gone into too much overtime (that is, a 2nd season).
0.99 	 Nevertheless, we can rejoice that there's something new out there for the 14-going-on-9 crowd.
0.96 	 The rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of Duck Dodgers.
1.0 	 Both my wife and I were in a great mood before starting this film, and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie.
1.0 	 We knew we hadn't rented Citizen Kane, and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever.
0.82 	 In order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be: children's.
0.67 	 I felt duty bound to watch the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of "Jane Eyre," because I'd just written an article about the 2006 BBC "Jane Eyre" for TheScreamOnline.<br /><br />So, I approached watching this the way I'd approach doing homework.<br /><br />I was irritated at first.
1.0 	 The lighting in this version is bad.
1.0 	 Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters.<br /><br />And the sound is poorly recorded.
0.79 	 They are too fussy, too Martha Stewart.
0.88 	 He just blew me away.
0.95 	 Welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when he shouts "Enough!"
0.96 	 It's stunning.<br /><br />And here's the key thing -- the actor performing Rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret.<br /><br />No other actor I've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does.
0.64 	 Dalton hits it out of the park.
0.71 	 If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar, i would say, "That guy is trouble.
0.9 	 Don't even look at him."
0.74 	 No, folks who know "Jane Eyre" only from the 2006 version, Bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips.
1.0 	 Rather, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and NOT pretty.<br /><br />Zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose.
0.98 	 She is no fashion model.
0.93 	 It is Christianity, and a Christian God, who convinces poor, plain, obscure Jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal.
1.0 	 The opening gag - dealing with bedwetting - is in poor taste, but is quickly forgotten.
0.5 	 I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had already anticipated.
0.59 	 The trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal Sheriff Dean.
0.97 	 Then it's lets-rip-off MACON COUNTY LINE-time as Dean stalks, traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one.
0.78 	 The ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film; it's also a study in despair.
0.81 	 SHALLOW GRAVE is a must for misanthropes, misogynists and nihilists the world over.
0.52 	 Hysterical if viewed through the eyes of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which I rate as a 10.
0.99 	 But then, had good judgment prevailed and "Final Justice" never was, then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice-over in "Mystery Science Theatre 3000"!
0.84 	 Then he goes about making a pot.
0.71 	 He sets about it, fainting from exhaustion, but eventually completes the task.<br /><br />In a marvellous sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings, which keep him in thrall, and he escapes back home.
0.89 	 The hand, for instance, is clearly someone's hand in a glove.
0.68 	 What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer.
0.98 	 <br /><br />On the plus side when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long.
0.78 	 Pretty good for straight to video.
1.0 	 For fans of the series it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins even exists.<br /><br />Tremors 4: The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10.
0.97 	 I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye.
0.76 	 The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it.
0.57 	 The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie.
0.89 	 Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead.
0.99 	 Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.
0.89 	 Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better.
0.94 	 Rather risquÃ© for 1931!
0.76 	 Probably the worst "major release" film I have seen in my life.
0.9 	 Probably, because of Steven Martini.
1.0 	 This movie was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama during the Independence war.
0.55 	 Finally, this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me: A painful one...
0.98 	 The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately.
0.83 	 I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh.
0.91 	 There are plenty of more enjoyable ways to spend an hour and a half such as watching paint dry or reading the dictionary.
0.86 	 I really like the ending.
0.98 	 It's true; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy.
0.52 	 I did force myself, however, to watch it all in one sitting, because I find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it.
1.0 	 She also happens to have a crazy brother Carl who lives in the woods, because her mother's hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house.
0.97 	 After hanging with Marion for awhile, Terry (our "hero") and Nancy decide they must contact their parents.
0.86 	 Despite everyone's warnings, Nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone (her fate is not hard to predict).
0.99 	 When Terry discovers that Gloria has disappeared from her room, she decides something isn't right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends.
0.99 	 That may be easier said than done, however, with crazy Carl lurking around
 <br /><br />After viewing Unhinged, I read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that Unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end.
0.93 	 Normally for the slow-building tactic to work, the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger.
0.96 	 Specifically, the ending was one of the best I've ever seen in a slasher film; you just do not expect that to happen.
0.98 	 Just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular.
0.87 	 Unhinged only grasps one part of this concept.
0.75 	 The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl.
1.0 	 It almost seems like when the action music kicks in, the most impressive stunt is running.
1.0 	 The movie is great sleep therapy.
1.0 	 This movie is highly recommended to pass.
1.0 	 I was excited to view a CataluÃ±aÂ´s film in the BerlinÂ´s competition.
0.97 	 The revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in Spain about Catholicism .
0.83 	 This is a travesty.<br /><br />First things first.
0.61 	 The story.
0.75 	 Anakin's evolution?
0.82 	 The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it.
0.51 	 He even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.<br /><br />What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling him legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith?
0.79 	 Everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house.
0.97 	 Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.<br /><br />In one specific fight scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart.
0.9 	 All the dialogue was of tremendously low quality.
1.0 	 We knew Luke and Leia are brother and sister, we knew Luke is Anakin's son, we knew Obi-Wan and Yoda go to exile, we knew everything.
0.66 	 Nothing new is offered in this film.
0.58 	 That is what this is.
0.98 	 If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic, does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic's sequel?
0.97 	 Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories, as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re-experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies.
0.98 	 The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script.
0.6 	 Don't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary, menacing and disturbing?
0.6 	 With his excellent film, Alexandre Aja nearly single-handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes, as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for.
0.98 	 Also, Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic "High Tension", but who is this new director?
1.0 	 Aja's "The Hills Have Eyes" was an unexpected hit, appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over-enthusiast target groups.
0.99 	 It's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive, especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year-old son.
0.67 	 Joe "heroes" and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills, this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original.
0.99 	 For example, wallets falling out of people's bloodied heads, women without any muscle power cast as tough-ass soldiers and Â my personal favorite Â assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications.
0.94 	 no movie with dennis hopper, gary busey, erika eleniak, tom berenger, dean stockwell, marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here.
0.99 	 I always thought Hyde was talented though, Faith is an interesting album.<br /><br />But on topic here folks.
0.99 	 Though Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but that's this film's only such redemption.
1.0 	 Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love?
0.65 	 If they gave an award to shows that suck THIS one should sweep the category.
0.98 	 Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining.
0.64 	 Now this film isn't going to scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reason and a smaller one- well, that's three reasons, isn't it.<br /><br />The first reason this is interesting is the special effects.
1.0 	 I found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular.
0.61 	 To see the hair growing on Marsha A.
1.0 	 Theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film.
0.85 	 I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing that I can tell you right away, there is NO comparison.
0.99 	 A martian that took different shapes.
1.0 	 In contrast, in the original, characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin.
0.57 	 He wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for 30 years as a sort of homage to the TV series.
0.95 	 He is also a drunk, a womaniser, and in the middle of a mid-life crisis.
0.98 	 They meet in the hotel bar late one night, after they've both had a few too many margaritas.<br /><br />Sounds like the set-up for a by-the-numbers comedy thriller, doesn't it?
0.97 	 But it isn't.
0.98 	 It avoids every twist that the above summary would suggest, sometimes even setting them up just to gleefully tear them down.
0.98 	 It is a film that respects it characters enough to just let them get on with it, without feeling the need to shove them into needless plot contrivances.<br /><br />Brosnan's hit-man will inevitably be compared to his Bond, but this is unfair to both performances.
1.0 	 The script isn't quite as good as could have been after maybe another rewrite.
0.92 	 One or two lines seem a little forced, and a couple of the jokes need a little more work.
0.74 	 The film feels no need to put the characters in any outlandish situations (other than meeting a hit-man, and said hit-man turning up on your doorstep).
0.58 	 And he really means it.
0.59 	 These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder.
0.94 	 There are a few gem moments for zombie fans, but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror.<br /><br />The zombies also take a long time to make their appearance.
0.87 	 The hero of the movie is an ex-Vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob.
0.95 	 The main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail.
0.54 	 But the badie psychotic head scientist/military guy has other plans in mind.
0.58 	 He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make ....da da da.... super soldiers!
0.99 	 She goes to the prison to see what's going down, the military guy calls in a few SWAT teams from his secure position outside the prison, and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out.
0.68 	 Meanwhile, the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother.
0.68 	 Still, the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film, when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner.<br /><br />The main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end.
0.55 	 Did this movie depth?
0.69 	 Character development?
0.9 	 Plot twists?
0.95 	 It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV.
1.0 	 Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly's mom.
0.89 	 Jaime is....well...GORGEOUS!
0.99 	 Some of the lines were corny, but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to English.
0.87 	 Finally the under dog get its shot, and Williams can save face, instead of being the clown.
0.64 	 The extreme parsimony of the movie, having a simple, slow story, just one actor and hardly any special effects, exerted a strong magic.
0.99 	 I therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grown-up woman, and her son) are introduced.
0.93 	 Another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: I couldn't bring an English pop-song together with French mountain glory.
0.92 	 Obviously, not everybody does.
0.81 	 Okay...so i've seen a lot of really odd/unusual movies in my day.
0.98 	 Fear and loathing in Las Vegas comes to mind when I think of that.
0.92 	 Well not anymore...from here on out, whenever someone asks me, "hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?"
0.75 	 Slipstream is what i'll say!
0.73 	 And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the movie, it was obvious that this was going to be one of those "trippy camera effect" movies.
0.97 	 The thing is, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but the only difference is that his trip was entertaining to watch, not painful!
0.99 	 Honestly, I had a real hard time even finishing Slipstream.
0.86 	 Point is, this movie hurts your brain when you watch it....it makes very little sense, it takes all of your concentration to even remotely try and understand what is going on and even at the end, the only thing you can be happy about is that it's over...and you can say you actually sat through it!
0.84 	 Next time, try something that relies a little more on great storytelling than camera techniques that tend to leave the viewer with a headache.
0.8 	 Sheesh.
0.99 	 He's the bad boy every woman secretly wants.
0.96 	 I recall, many a night, passing out to this fine feature film in college, and pondering the sheer awesomenes of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of .<br /><br />There is lots of singing.
0.85 	 But there is much more to this movie.
0.87 	 There are fat children (clay).
0.97 	 There is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off (obviously clay too).
1.0 	 This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of Conan Doyle's famous novel 'The Lost World'.
0.78 	 And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World.
0.98 	 Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make.
0.52 	 I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film.
0.86 	 It's great to see J.Beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes.
1.0 	 There is no real emotional depth to the story.
0.59 	 It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br />
1.0 	 Devil Dog sets your heart racing.
0.72 	 It's brilliantly paced, the ending comes like a bolt out of the blue and plunges itself into the very centre of your being.
0.98 	 FANTASTIC!
0.99 	 There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism.
1.0 	 "Boom" has garnered itself a something of a reputation.
0.99 	 It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some may wish to add "Secret Ceremony"), managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work, the wonderful "Go-Between".<br /><br />Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams.
1.0 	 From the mid forties until the early sixties, Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status, remaining in theater repertory throughout the world, many becoming much praised films.
0.66 	 When William's muse deserted him, probably owing to his notorious substance abuse, it deserted him for good.
1.0 	 Williams at his best is an actor's dream providing many unforgettable performances.
0.92 	 (Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in "Night of the Iguana" ? )
1.0 	 Taylor in particular, shone in both "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer".
0.91 	 There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare, to which he replied "if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams".
1.0 	 Following his short lived theatrical stardom, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood.
0.53 	 A rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested.
0.72 	 is it funny?
0.87 	 So you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right?
0.74 	 So there is some kind of dupery involved.
0.81 	 Do not be duped by 'The 4th Man"s deceptively alluring packaging or mr. Voerhoven's reputation as a good director etc.
1.0 	 Already writer-director Preston Sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue.
0.95 	 (No wonder the Coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to Sturges.
0.95 	 If you've seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one.
0.65 	 It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior.
0.9 	 Before Willie Garvin.<br /><br />The pace is a trifle slow, and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes.
0.88 	 Sadly.
0.94 	 I feel magnanimous even referring to it as a "movie".
0.77 	 But it goes rapidly downhill from there.
0.72 	 They have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale.
0.78 	 It's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days.
0.91 	 It's a good movie if you plan to watch lots of landscapes and animals, like an animal documentary.
1.0 	 i don't think it's garbage .it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either .
0.98 	 its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster .
0.99 	 After a few lean years, 1968 was a pretty swell time for Elvis: not only did he make that celebrated "Comeback" TV Special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well Â SPEEDWAY and LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE.
0.53 	 - and Thomas Gomez who is particularly amusing as sarcastic Chief Thundercloud who is Meredith's stubborn father still donning his old chieftain clothes in the present day!
0.8 	 On the other hand, the climactic 'destruction of the house' episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here...
0.94 	 But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS one is Z-rated.
1.0 	 The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously.
0.99 	 It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the New York phone book.
0.83 	 This film is none of those.
0.94 	 It doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality.
0.57 	 And the fact that a lot of the film was shot in Huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable.
0.88 	 Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters.
0.91 	 And the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me.
1.0 	 A home atmosphere appears to make the movie's allegory more receptive to viewers.
0.55 	 However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable, heavily moralistic lines that will have no-one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny.
0.77 	 I have never commented on a film before.
0.67 	 It does.
0.98 	 It's been almost 24 hours and I am still completely affected.
0.54 	 I love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end.
0.78 	 If you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it.
0.93 	 Just make sure you have no distractions.
0.92 	 Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida.
0.95 	 Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate.
0.81 	 They find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction.
0.92 	 Neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them.
0.54 	 Meanwhile, Rene, a young naive French woman also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return.
0.82 	 Thus, Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson, he is convinced to leave Dawson after Gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from Dawson.
0.55 	 Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff make a hurried exit from Dawson while they are still alive.
0.95 	 )<br /><br />The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women.
0.71 	 Although she is clearly characterized as a "bad" girl, Jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the US or Yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from Gannon.
0.83 	 She dies as a result and Jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!
0.76 	 ).<br /><br />It's clear that Corine Calvert, as Renee, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda, in Jeff's mind.
1.0 	 (He's not her father).<br /><br />Another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between Jeff and Gannon's gang.
0.81 	 If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk, before Jeff did the same to him.
0.95 	 And how did Jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease?
0.99 	 I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims.
0.96 	 They were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow.
0.7 	 And why weren't most of Ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?<br /><br />You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and Gannon's gang.
0.97 	 Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree.
0.69 	 The film starts off as an okay, albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims.
1.0 	 He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith.
0.81 	 Thanks to Tess' helpful hints, Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty, but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing.
0.52 	 Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world (that's what I would do in his position), Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper.
1.0 	 He annoyingly calls him "Buddy-Boy" all the time and possesses the bodies of Logan's friends and colleagues in order to trick him.
0.98 	 Lou Diamond Philips' performance is adequate enough, but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of "La Bamba" and "Stand And Deliver" serious as a tough copper.
0.94 	 There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson ("Forrest Gump"), Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls") and B-movie horror legend David Gale ("Re-Animator") appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film.
0.5 	 Yipee!
0.67 	 The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip.
0.64 	 Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him.
0.91 	 And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic.
0.9 	 My comment?
0.66 	 It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie.
0.83 	 This was made to win awards - which I remember it duly did.
0.79 	 But it was neither interesting nor entertaining.
0.68 	 I haven't seen the play so cannot compare.
0.92 	 It chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further.
0.9 	 In the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes.
0.83 	 Ben Draper wrote this?
0.68 	 The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film).
0.53 	 Never has a film had so many mistakes in it.
0.68 	 An incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man?
0.76 	 As a sane minded and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie.
0.67 	 Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself.
0.75 	 So she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her, so that she can move on.
0.51 	 But Fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money, and the man standing between her and it is transparent, so that she doesn't even notice or care what he looks like, she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it.
0.97 	 When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to believe it would be as heart-warming as some of the first Lassie films were.
1.0 	 John Ford is partly responsible for that; the IMDb trivia section shows how he tricked McLaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene.
0.96 	 This director also could bring out a lot in his actors, even without such tricks.
0.71 	 It's a rather sad comment on our own set of expectations and prejudices.<br /><br />Ford, as usual, packs a lot into a little bit of film.
0.57 	 I just remember HATING this movie.
0.94 	 Sure, the plot isn't Oldboy.
0.94 	 The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization.
0.97 	 The designs put some of it's other Gundam counterparts to shame.
0.98 	 Char isn't given this label.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems.
0.54 	 The first is the reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks.
0.66 	 But on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old.
0.96 	 <br /><br />The second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year.
0.99 	 <br /><br />But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often.
0.79 	 This movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for Christmas.
0.69 	 One interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there's a Cold War tension portrayed between America and Russia.
0.99 	 Some of the scenes involving Gamera, particularly the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time.
0.85 	 Lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time, most of them broadcast between 11 p.m. Friday nights and 1 a.m. Saturday mornings.
0.95 	 There is a great deal of "steamy" sex, several murders, and all sorts of rude behavior--virtually none of which is either interesting or credible.
0.81 	 Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented.
0.93 	 Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents.
0.65 	 Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges.
0.83 	 Candy is doubly watched (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless.
0.75 	 They can't stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
0.74 	 The film fails to provide a single likable character, and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players.
0.98 	 This is not helped by the acting.
0.98 	 Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance.
0.99 	 Everything works out fine.<br /><br />It's sometimes argued, and I can see why, that Scott's romance with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down.
0.78 	 I could have done without her singing, right enough, but I found the romance rather touching.
0.99 	 Hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher, wearing a pair of spectacles, no makeup, and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast.
1.0 	 The problem is that AFTER her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before, only with a glossier outfit.
0.93 	 But what does a plain-looking woman do?
0.92 	 Henry Kissinger had groupies.
0.98 	 It must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours.
0.97 	 As a kind of a footnote, I must mention that Randolph Scott was rumored to be bisexual by Hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on, and it's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he's putting homely Hilliard off -- "Women don't interest me, sister."
0.97 	 Her performance is accidentally sabotaged by Astaire who slips some Alka Seltzer or something into her water, and she hiccups through her number, burping being too indelicate for the time.<br /><br />As a dancer, I'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur, but I think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film.
0.9 	 I had just taken a water taxi ashore myself.
0.98 	 And they're worn properly, hats down to two finger-widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back.
0.99 	 I'm certain no breach of discipline was intended."
1.0 	 It's what an officer -- a good officer -- would say, and nobody laughs.<br /><br />The series was getting a little repetitious by the time "Follow the Fleet" was made so instead of putting Fred into high society and a tuxedo, they turned him into a gum-chewing swabbie instead.
0.53 	 And the dance numbers are up to the concept.
0.73 	 I have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home.<br /><br />I am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism's effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it).
0.81 	 The footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression.
0.75 	 But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently.<br /><br />Unlike other documentaries on this subject, I don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this.
0.94 	 As a young black/latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me.
0.87 	 Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was simply not properly developed.
0.99 	 I just was not too impressed.
0.51 	 Shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.
0.52 	 Recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co-operation of real life persons; that in itself is an eye catcher.
0.81 	 Worthy of at least an 8 out of 10.
1.0 	 What saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script.
0.93 	 I really expected something more substantial in the terms of action, or plot but I got very little.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was Madonna.
1.0 	 She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad.
0.75 	 The movie at some points just stood still.
0.84 	 You expected something more and you got nothing.
0.6 	 Al Pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good.
1.0 	 I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things.
0.75 	 The thing about this movie is it is good, but it could have been so much better.
0.6 	 <br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />I especially thought the finale was not big enough.
0.96 	 Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
1.0 	 "Everything a great documentary could be"??
0.97 	 Everything but meaning, wit, visual style, and interesting subject matter.
0.51 	 .
0.93 	 Let's be honest shall we?
0.76 	 While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed "global Warming" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it.
0.69 	 A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)?
0.62 	 Hell, even 50-60 years ago?
0.99 	 Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of certainty that the planet is "getting warmer" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best?
0.79 	 Thirty years ago, Time Magazine did a cover proclaiming a "New Ice Age".
0.91 	 The truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Erruptions, Solar Activity & El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed "Global Warming."
0.68 	 Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism?
0.96 	 Anyway, I hear the producers of A.I.T are working on their next film entitled "Gnomes, Fairies & Elves: Our Endangered Friends."
0.87 	 The deceptive cover, title and very small hidden print of Power of Prayer tricked me into renting this movie.<br /><br />It started out really well and pulled me in.
0.99 	 I REALLY liked it.
0.89 	 This movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just got better and better.
0.99 	 I thought: "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh?
0.65 	 Well...we'll see how he does..." Then I saw Peter Falk was in it.
0.95 	 but I couldn't find his number.
0.85 	 Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything.
0.99 	 It just came on and I thought:"Eh, why not?
0.97 	 Trash/bad movies usually ain't bad because I will find them enjoyable.
0.52 	 There is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie.
0.89 	 These pre-code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination.
1.0 	 John Wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach.
0.97 	 The characterizations and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kller's character are pure torture.
0.59 	 Al Pacino, as "Big Boy" Caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters.
0.63 	 And then there's The Kid, a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in, who models himself after his surrogate father, and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up.<br /><br />The supporting players are a Who's Who of character actors.
1.0 	 Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles, the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say.
0.59 	 Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since.
1.0 	 Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.
0.97 	 lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film "HUGE" or a "HIT" with the general movie-going public.
0.75 	 Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.
0.94 	 At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking.
0.99 	 The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!
1.0 	 So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was "overhyped"...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being "overhyped".
0.99 	 Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.
0.92 	 However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!
0.97 	 However, this film might not be for everyone.
0.99 	 DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!
0.97 	 THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard!
0.97 	 The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!
0.92 	 It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before.
0.96 	 They dont make them anymore.
0.58 	 This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete's sake !<br /><br />Anyway, I watch it at least once a week.
0.94 	 No kidding.
0.9 	 I have dissected this movie from end to end.
0.72 	 Think about it.
0.84 	 Was it necessary ?
1.0 	 Could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink ?
0.99 	 Only a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes just kicked the crap out of her husband.
0.95 	 could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way.
0.58 	 It is a documentary of real life.<br /><br />I only wish there was a director's cut....
0.98 	 You can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built.
0.94 	 And you'll recognize the area from any Randolph Scott movie.<br /><br />I won't bother with the plot, since I'm sure it's covered elsewhere.
0.89 	 It's about Thugees, a sect in India, whence our English word "thug."
0.55 	 Dynasties rose and fell.
0.94 	 But it isn't that at all.
0.58 	 Read Deborah Tannen, nobody's idea of an anti-feminist.
1.0 	 And Grant, Fairbanks, and MacLaughlin have got it in spades.<br /><br />Sorry to ramble on about evolution but I'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease.
0.93 	 Did I ever tell you about the horse in Vaitongi, Samoa, that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me?
0.69 	 Only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies.
0.8 	 Yes -- the colonel's got to know.
0.97 	 The only decent film he's done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES.
0.96 	 There was not a single memorable character in the whole film.
1.0 	 Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful.<br /><br />By comparison, JASON X: "FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE" was a masterpiece.
1.0 	 Now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.
0.82 	 So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all by its lonesome self.
0.73 	 I like seeing films based on serial killers.
0.74 	 If you make a movie like this then directing is your hobby-NOT what you should be doing for a living- SHould not make it to the DVD renal outlets for movie buffs like myself.
0.71 	 Don't know who they are?
0.95 	 This documentary (or I should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be, when they have full enthusiasm on something like that.
0.96 	 I recently found this movie on VHS after looking for it for a number of years, I was not disappointed.
0.71 	 Ustinov plays an accountant/embezzler, just released from England's infamous Wormwood Scrubs prison (he had embezzled from the Conservative Party headquarters, selected because he is a Liberal).
0.99 	 Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer obligingly tells, him, "Disconnect blue light."
0.99 	 Using hacking techniques from 30 years in the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate checks written to various bogus companies.
0.92 	 When this movie was released, it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks.
0.99 	 It does, but in a mesmerizing sort of way.
0.51 	 The performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very few stops in between.
0.54 	 It doesn't disappoint, and the convergence proves a double-whammy.
0.98 	 The location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production.
0.76 	 But if you like the muppets I defy you to dislike this one.
0.71 	 Basically the same plot regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx.
0.95 	 With the SyFy Channel's sure-fire recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it possibly go wrong?
0.85 	 <br /><br />Please Read The Full Review On My Blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
0.99 	 <br /><br />The movie "Slugs" is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry.
0.65 	 Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spills some highly volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks a bookcase over on himself, and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes.
1.0 	 They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did!<br /><br />If you hate humans, and I know I do, you'll appreciate "Slugs".
0.64 	 One of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in the film is when an Ann Coulter lookalike, at a residents' meeting in an exclusive gated community, complains of the mestizos, "they have no concept of struggle or sacrifice."
0.7 	 Duh!
0.54 	 )<br /><br />Then the storm starts to gather force as the coup organizers call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters into changing the route at the last minute and marching on the presidential palace, knowing it is surrounded by Chavez supporters and violence is inevitable.<br /><br />Another element of the plot falls into place as snipers on rooftops begin to fire on the Chavez supporters, some of whom fire back.
0.66 	 The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return fire and claims that Chavez supporters are massacring protesters.
0.96 	 Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty!
0.86 	 Needless to say the footage of the empty street was edited out by the rabidly anti-Chavez private TV stations (who had been airing a constant barrage of propaganda calling Chavez mentally ill and sexually fixated on Fidel Castro.)
0.85 	 Chavez eventually surrenders to avoid bloodshed but refuses to resign and is whisked away to an offshore island where a plane awaits to take him - where?
0.97 	 How can the remaining cabinet members avoid arrest and defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are closely linked to the Bush administration?
0.96 	 Not to be missed!
0.95 	 <br /><br />'Dan In Real Life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices.
1.0 	 It has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require, and indeed would be ruined by, any further embellishment.
0.92 	 At the same time, the theme is entirely adult.
0.88 	 Even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old!
0.92 	 In most parts I just didn't know what was going to happen next!
0.82 	 I was like I think this is going to happen, wait I think this is going to happen.
0.88 	 In some parts I couldn't stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally grossed out and I couldn't believe what I was seeing!
0.58 	 I am definitely going to see this movie again!
0.99 	 It is one of those movies where it can't get boring.
1.0 	 If you are confused by allegory, or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy, you won't like this film.
0.91 	 Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the statement of the movie becomes clear.
0.94 	 The only thing odd is the casting.
0.82 	 Who could possibly have wished for a sequel to Bert I. Gordon's legendary bad trash-film "Food of the Gods"?
0.92 	 There's a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and Â it has to be said Â the music is surprisingly atmospheric.
0.64 	 Go nuts!
0.87 	 I am desperate for a good movie that will do ONE of his books justice!
0.86 	 Worth your time to see!<br /><br />Maybe they will make a sequel?
0.57 	 :)<br /><br />8 out of 10
0.97 	 I've seen a lot of crap in my day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake.
0.85 	 I saw a free screening in NY the other night.
0.88 	 I can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers.
1.0 	 One highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg.
1.0 	 It was priceless and was the only scene I truly had a hearty laugh at.
0.73 	 I know I was expecting more from it.
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 A young couple Mandy Pullman (Mitch Martin) and Roy Seeley (Matt Birman) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of Galen.
0.98 	 Dr. Sam Cordell (John Cassavetes) and his daughter Jenny (Erin Flannery) are both new to Galen after the death of Sam's wife.
0.98 	 A local journalist named Laura Kincaid (Kerrie Keane) reports the events and suggests to Sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier.
0.66 	 More rapes and murders occur.
0.81 	 Tim's story and digging into the towns past makes Sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an Incubus - a shape-shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce!
0.93 	 The monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes.
1.0 	 "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it.<br /><br />On the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming.
0.62 	 Next worst is everything about the plot, which is loaded with soap opera scenes.
0.72 	 You need a land ownership dispute for that?
0.86 	 I highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative; it works better than an overdose of demarol.
0.96 	 Unfortunately the movie was rather short, unusually so for a period piece, and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect.
0.84 	 Over the course of the movie, they realize their problems and begin fixing them.
0.53 	 You know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children.
0.96 	 Insted it is more like young adult humor movie.
0.9 	 under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres.
0.87 	 I think in short this means adult humor.
0.86 	 She was actually somewhat endearing in this role.
0.69 	 "I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!"
0.99 	 His deputy asks.<br /><br />Well, no, not really.
0.96 	 What follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the Martian's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of "Big Bean, IL".
0.52 	 Everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes, except for the Sheriff's daughter and her friend, a kid in a duck suit.<br /><br />The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on.
0.99 	 But, like all clichÃ©s, it is based on the truth.
0.67 	 He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better.
0.96 	 I do not want to give away too much.
0.8 	 Emma is that movie.

1.0 	 is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy.
0.83 	 *** from ****
0.98 	 a bit slow and boring, the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman, the brothers sitting on the porch, the wealthy cigar smoking man.
1.0 	 Arthur Penn's film had style, humor, a point of view, and was made by talented people.
1.0 	 The 1967 version strayed from the facts, presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting, and innovative for 1967, and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care.
0.99 	 I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes.
0.66 	 As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff.
0.99 	 The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well.
1.0 	 Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film.
0.7 	 Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.
0.61 	 The couple believe Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit needed to revive Caine's career.<br /><br />"The Trap Is Set
 For A Wickedly Funny Who'll-Do-It."
0.93 	 One thing that did not work (for me) was the curtain call ending; surely, it played better on stage.
0.91 	 The location isn't really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar.
1.0 	 And, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid.
0.99 	 But, the play was so good, "even a gifted director couldn't ruin it."
0.99 	 The BFG is one of Roald Dahl's most cherished books, but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there.
0.92 	 Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first!
0.7 	 One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street.
0.98 	 The figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night.
0.7 	 Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her.
1.0 	 But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG (voice of David Jason).
1.0 	 Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants.
1.0 	 Together they go to the Queen of England (voice of Angela Thorne) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man-eating giants.
0.98 	 Little of Dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily.
0.99 	 One chapter in the book deals with the BFG's love of "whizzpopping" (farting) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious.
1.0 	 I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite!
0.99 	 It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side.
0.95 	 Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ?
0.97 	 Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp.
0.67 	 After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures.
0.6 	 It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately.
0.99 	 Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium.
0.85 	 The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
0.97 	 When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of "making up," and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.)
1.0 	 If anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.<br /><br />And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist.
0.9 	 You don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.
0.88 	 )<br /><br />Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either.
0.65 	 of watching this as a child.
0.75 	 I also recall working on a Saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching it, so I wasn't really paying much attention.
0.99 	 I've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail.
0.89 	 12 years ago, one person mentioned that, possibly, he had seen it, but he thought it merely a dream; a fanciful piffle like wind.
0.52 	 No dreaming now.
0.66 	 Again, I haven't seen it since then, but I can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my VCR.
0.53 	 Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die, Stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant.
0.98 	 My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird.
0.86 	 This movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a Mom (lisa Hartman Black) who acts like a man would in an action thriller.
0.86 	 Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police, here the Mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son.
0.91 	 She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her.<br /><br />Before finally catching up with her son, a lot of bizarre things happen.
0.84 	 The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Children's Play at a community theater.
0.73 	 The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft, and even though it must have taken some time (in a real world), she and the lawyer-boyfriend, and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall.
0.59 	 The lawyer saves her, but they miss a chance to run after the Dad.
0.9 	 At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico.
0.95 	 In some ways, this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive.
0.96 	 On the other hand, seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun (or funny?
0.51 	 ).
0.77 	 What we've got here is a Situation.
0.96 	 At the end they are forced to let it go.
0.95 	 You can't fix people.
0.57 	 Charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating Manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair.
0.96 	 The hair is Sandler's chief prop to show he's deranged.
0.64 	 And the use of music as an escape must hit home to every iPod-wielding subway rider.<br /><br />Charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically Alan, stuck with a controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon begins to envy him.
0.7 	 Charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund (insurance money from the tragedy), and starts dragging Alan off to "hang out," "eat Chinese," buy records, or watch a Mel Brooks marathon at a rep house.
0.74 	 Alan has a new patient who is propositioning him.
0.67 	 Charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family, because to escape his loss, he is pretending he never had one.
1.0 	 And so what if as a roommate Charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste (no Motown)?
0.9 	 He's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners, who lord it over him though it's he who set up the practice.
0.78 	 They're white, by the way, and he's black.<br /><br />There's also the lascivious patient from hell, who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices, but starts looking different when Charlie comes by and notices she's a babe.
0.92 	 His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute.
1.0 	 But there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times, many of the people are too broadly drawn, and the overly grand Hollywood interiors have dreadful dÃ©cor; only the Manhattan streets look real.
0.92 	 There's a courtroom scene that is preposterous, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who's too good to be true.
0.94 	 Alan's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call.
0.53 	 Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, though that's clearly a better movie, in fact a much better one.
0.98 	 Due to her past treatment by men, she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets.
0.63 	 Falling in love with a kind man, her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs.
0.99 	 The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs.
0.55 	 But, as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go, this one is hard to beat.
1.0 	 Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (as Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporting players.
0.99 	 The support cast isn't too bad either.
0.99 	 "Sky Captain" may be considered an homage to comic books, pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres.
0.99 	 One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences.
0.82 	 I don't think this is at all true.
0.96 	 One's expectations of the films,fiction and serials that "Captain" pays tribute to were entirely different.
0.79 	 Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children.
0.91 	 Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama.
0.99 	 One does expect them to be fun, thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic.
0.99 	 Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side?
0.86 	 They can FLY!!!
0.93 	 Only Giovanni Ribisi (who showed himself capable of great nuance here) and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any "oomph" to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he'd only been given the chance.
1.0 	 CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical, when it is used to create creatures who don't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular.
0.57 	 There is no real sense of wonder.
1.0 	 Even so, had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable.
0.57 	 "The Last Samurai" was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that "Captain" didn't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that "Sky Captain" most definitely did not.<br /><br />I'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's.
1.0 	 The original (Jay Garrick) Flash or Green Lantern (Alan Scott) come to mind as being ripe for such treatment.
0.9 	 Maybe the better, more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film.
0.93 	 The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi.
0.8 	 The movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make Pokemon famous.
0.96 	 The movie should better not associated with animes such as Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh.
0.97 	 The drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime.
0.94 	 I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon.
0.52 	 Digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to Pokemon.It's second movie is coming out late 2002.
0.93 	 I remember watching this on prime time when I was about 7 years old.
0.76 	 I was a huge comic book reader at the time, and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily.
0.97 	 The end result, however, was underwhelming.<br /><br />I was aware of the "Emma Peel" Diana Prince stories, as they had only recently come to an end and Diana was returned to her Amazonian form.
0.85 	 Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was no better.
0.54 	 The script had a few good ideas, like the rogue Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring.<br /><br />I think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax.
0.9 	 The budget was also pretty low here, and superheroes don't come cheap.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, if only as a comparison and historical document.
0.52 	 Even Superman 4 is available, and it has nothing over this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman).
1.0 	 It's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions.
0.78 	 Time and time again, I've stated that if people don't want remakes or sequels made, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film.
0.63 	 The plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing here is avant-garde storytelling at work; you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie.<br /><br />Where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound.
1.0 	 What you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice-over which often sounds insincere and worse still is the continuous background music, which goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything.
0.84 	 If you have the book you know what I mean.
0.98 	 The best bit was when Stephen King was in it.
0.66 	 A few of the performances even made me laugh out loud!
1.0 	 The film was was not as I imagined it, after reading the book which was awesome, I imagined it darker and a lot scarier.
0.55 	 Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter.
0.69 	 Husband and wife heated discussions(or should I say fights?)
0.89 	 the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary.
0.87 	 zero special effects...and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet.
0.66 	 (Usually messing up classic characters) No wonder anime is beating American cartoons!
0.93 	 <br /><br />Oh, I just heard of this last night; I live in the UK and when I found out this show first came out in 2005,well, I never knew the UK was so up-to-date with current shows.
0.63 	 Answer: Yes, and this is one of them.
0.8 	 To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES!
1.0 	 The acting here is, at best, sub-standard.
0.98 	 Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush.
1.0 	 Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets.
1.0 	 As if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry, this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm.
0.98 	 and snaps big time into a furious breakdown.
0.79 	 The scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch.
0.76 	 A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail.
0.86 	 He was a riot.
0.77 	 <br /><br />Karen gets stuck in Paris, and befriends a sissily-handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon.
0.71 	 Save your time and your energy.
0.96 	 the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing.
0.74 	 the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics.
0.93 	 fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic!
0.98 	 I enjoyed the movie very much, emotionally, intellectually, and visually.
0.92 	 [3] The movie is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film, except the final resolution last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long.
0.84 	 [4] I will not recommend this movie because of 5-seconds of background narration, which did not add one bit to the side-character it applied to, or the film -- it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward: the main character's mother of German ancestry, when watching old WWII movies, "secretly roots for the Germans."
0.88 	 I don't know of any Germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazi's won WWII.
1.0 	 I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago.
0.58 	 And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching.
1.0 	 Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen.
0.9 	 <br /><br />As I watched the movie, I had the highest of hopes.
0.97 	 Never had I been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption.
0.77 	 <br /><br />I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie.
1.0 	 Nearly every single one felt the same way--cheated out of the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created!
1.0 	 <br /><br />I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make.
1.0 	 This one was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses.
0.97 	 This movie tries hard, but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s TV series, that I am sure people do remember with fondness.
1.0 	 Although I am 17, I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun.
1.0 	 Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative.
0.85 	 1/10 Bethany Cox
0.82 	 She's never looked better, and fairly sizzles on screen.
0.88 	 I have seen this movie.
0.75 	 Dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays.
0.8 	 Today's youth must understand this problem.
0.87 	 There is less population of girls.
0.97 	 And due to this problem of dowry , the girls committed suicide.
0.95 	 The original said it all and still holds up.
0.77 	 Eric Roberts as Perry Smith?
0.58 	 His sister could have done a better job!
1.0 	 The original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings.
1.0 	 Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake.
1.0 	 Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall...The original is available on DVD in widescreen now.
0.96 	 Since Gene Kelly was nominated for this performance instead of his role in `Singin' in the Rain', then there had to be something wrong with the behind the scenes rigging systems at MGM.
0.72 	 <br /><br />If there was a need to practice picking up women for 1949's `On the Town', then perhaps the shore leave lucky sailors did not have to promise an audition with Jose Iturbi and strike up the piano for a whole hearted `Susie' rendition.
0.99 	 I will probably always go to see a Woody Alleb movie, as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness.
0.93 	 Just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile.
0.86 	 I'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody, but what can one say?
0.75 	 It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which in my opinion, he is rather quite good.
1.0 	 There's always hope and I'll continue to love and respect The WOODY!
0.51 	 !
0.68 	 My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall.
0.77 	 I hated the fox that became Casper's friend.
0.56 	 Get over it!
0.65 	 The only good part and I don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end.
0.54 	 I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment I put us through.
0.54 	 Masters of Horror: The Screwfly Solution starts as America is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population, when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of God.
0.69 	 I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks, it takes itself far too seriously & I don't really understand why it's part of the Masters of Horror series, the horror that the filmmakers are going for in The Screwfly Solution is in the actual story itself & themes & ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it's gets the chance during it's short 60 odd minute running time which I felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up.
0.98 	 There's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle, a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle & another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about.<br /><br />Technically like the other episodes it's really good & it doesn't have the look of a cheap TV series, the special effects are great as usual & it's well made.
0.53 	 Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany.
1.0 	 Oddly, Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director, but at least such films as 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).<br /><br />Abominable acting.
0.95 	 Tensionless rhythm.
0.76 	 Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.<br /><br />Then things fall apart real quick.
0.96 	 followed by the the shoot-out: a born-again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at Easter break.
0.99 	 Another lovely line: "So what are we going to do?"
0.72 	 And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode.<br /><br />At one point we learn that Daddy isn't really the daddy, but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either.
0.98 	 This story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins.
0.57 	 He fortunately got his.
0.87 	 There are two great MST-worthy comic moments: the gusher when Angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby's head.
0.96 	 As for that audacious male abortion scene...well, they should have retained Miike's episode and banned this one instead.<br /><br />In short, a 3rd rate Rosemary's Baby meets Alien set on the turf of a M.A.S.H.
0.58 	 episode.
0.99 	 A real shame, since there have been a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs as Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee's deliciously quirky 'Sick Girl'.
0.87 	 Not to mention the superb imagery of Malone's 'Fairhaired Child'.<br /><br />Sorry John Carpenter, I believe your directing days are over.
0.91 	 It's time to run for President.
0.89 	 The story revolves around a pretty, young, scatter brained mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavioral researcher named James, merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children.
0.81 	 Uncle Albert must make Ed appear suitably smart, so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results.<br /><br />Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self, and pulls off the character of Einstein quite effectively.
0.8 	 Michel dresses as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called 'Cinema Lies', where he describes mistakes in films.
0.84 	 Roger is a callous figure as he pushes Michel right over the limit during the record attempt, which almost results in his death.
0.51 	 Wha-BAM!
0.59 	 Writer Howard Cohen expands the "Sword & Sorcery" concept with a couple of extra S's, like Sex, Silliness, (more) Sex and Sheer Stupidity!
0.98 	 "Deathstalker" literally wipes the floor with its obvious role-model "Conan: The Barbarian" when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance.
0.98 	 On his journey he combines forces with a troll-turned-human, a fighter who's even gayer than he is and - last but not least - a luscious lady who doesn't really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras.
0.77 	 Together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil Munkar where they'll participate in a warriors' tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements.
0.85 	 The monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing, but it's undeniable entertainment if you're in an undemanding mood.
1.0 	 I presume this isn't a favorite amongst feminists, as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat 
um
discriminating.
0.99 	 The two "leading" ladies (Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson) are ravishing but - in all honesty - if it wouldn't be for their continuously exposed racks, they would hardly be worth mentioning, either.
1.0 	 The best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect.
0.99 	 The director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and this is his best movie.<br /><br />In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together.
0.66 	 You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it, though.
0.51 	 Some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds.
0.91 	 Nick Cage plays the "down on his luck" main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people, town, violence and threat of Red Rock West.
0.58 	 <br /><br />Being essentially a revenge film, it shares this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet, and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.
0.95 	 The volatile cowboy toys with the tenderfoot husband, and dispatches him like a caricature of a cat toying with an insect before biting its head off.
0.65 	 I'll admit that I liked the first one, and was really looking forward to the sequel.<br /><br />I was let down.
0.55 	 Alright, I admit to liking 80% of the chase scene -- but the fight with all the Mr Smiths?
0.83 	 Yet, it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant TV coverage of the Vietnam War.
0.85 	 His old-school father naturally disapproves of Jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie-era, extemporaneous ceremonies.
0.98 	 He lands his dream job in New York, but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease.
0.91 	 There is a veneer of then-contemporary film-making techniques displayed by director Arthur Hiller, but none of that can hide the old-fashioned, clichÃ©-ridden story at its core.
0.92 	 The inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.<br /><br />Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw became stars with this movie as Oliver and Jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling.
0.95 	 At least the boyish O'Neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach, but MacGraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what Oliver sees in Jenny beyond her sarcastic faÃ§ade.
0.99 	 The overly familiar Frances Lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years.
0.99 	 The print quality on the DVD is good, though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by Hiller.
0.84 	 The most interesting bit of trivia is that author Erich Segal (upon whose book this movie is based) conceived Oliver as a mix between two Harvard roommates he knew Â Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of Oliver's roommates.
1.0 	 this movie is practically impossible to describe.
0.58 	 the alternate title "Don't Look Up" is a lot more descriptive.
0.86 	 The story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 deserter.
0.7 	 by an actress who died(?)
0.77 	 during the filming of a tv show back in the 60s.
0.99 	 It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney.
0.83 	 The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the "streamline" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead.
1.0 	 They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added some dialogue.
0.98 	 But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br /><br />This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0.95 	 Unfortunately not much else lies below it.
0.87 	 The plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show.
0.54 	 But it's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films.
0.78 	 Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself baffled.
0.99 	 This couldn't have been better.
0.53 	 The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed in any other way.
0.88 	 This is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles.
0.52 	 (won him various awards) Before American Beauty, Mendes worked as a play director for the British Theater, but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater.
0.99 	 I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day.
0.91 	 That is actually quite an accomplish.
0.5 	 Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later?
0.95 	 Blustering, prim and proper Englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does.
0.99 	 Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series.
1.0 	 Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing, manipulative father, it was incredibly light-hearted and fun to watch in practice.
1.0 	 In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time.
0.9 	 The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.<br /><br />This movie spin-off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word.
0.93 	 Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film.
0.74 	 Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie.
1.0 	 In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers.<br /><br />Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series.
0.98 	 It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually very funny.
0.8 	 [***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***] This movie's reputation precedes it, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch it in letterbox on TCM.
1.0 	 What a major disappointment.<br /><br />The cast is superb and the production values are first-rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on too long.
0.87 	 One example is the portrayal of Frank Hirsch's unfaithfuness: his rather heavy-handed request to his wife to "go upstairs and relax a bit" followed by her predictable pleading of a headache, leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary ("hey Nancy, I've got the blues tonight.
0.76 	 Also, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Having said that, Maclaine's performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here.
1.0 	 Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to.
1.0 	 But there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch.
0.99 	 For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role).
0.67 	 NOTE: This isn't an action movie!!!
0.99 	 It uses an occasional voice-over narration (by Ms. Judd) while writing in her journal -- and oh, I see I've just lost the male half of the readers out there.
0.92 	 The downside: It is NOT on DVD, except in Spanish.
0.8 	 (We learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of a VHS version, which can be readily found online.
0.56 	 So buy a copy for yourself.<br /><br />This movie should have a major re-release, and it would, if I were Queen of Hollywood.<br /><br />-- Figgy Jones
0.91 	 When Archie began to write his stories for the papers; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert/absorb the First Nation Peoples.<br /><br />The film puts forward and asks the question; why would a well-educated, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian?<br /><br /> Archie, as an English boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is.
0.72 	 Sounds like a famous puppet story doesn't it.<br /><br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the "Cigar store Indian" a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done acting on the part of Mr. Brosnan.
0.63 	 He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist.
0.97 	 The fullness and or reality of it weren't realized till he met and married his wife, Annie.<br /><br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the Englishman's world stage, not as himself but Grey Owl -an Canadian Native of the wilderness frontier.<br /><br /> This is the closest Archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype.<br /><br /> Mr. Brosnan's interpretation as well as the directors is both well done.
1.0 	 I have watched documentaries on Grey Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.<br /><br />Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs was a great a great moment in the film.<br /><br /> Very beautiful Canadian lake scenery and real "Grey Owl" locations.<br /><br />
0.69 	 I watched this movie when I was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as I had ever seen-or ever was to see.
1.0 	 It may not have been a great movie.
0.88 	 I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn.
0.99 	 Still, when I think back on the shower scene I can still remember how great it felt way back when.<br /><br />Added later: After watching the movie again, I discovered that it's dangerous to go home again.
0.81 	 That older woman is now younger than I am.
0.82 	 Sitting in a theater and hearing first-hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than I could bear.
0.62 	 Whether you support the war or not, it is OUR duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker.
0.68 	 See this film!
0.93 	 And it did.
0.73 	 The characters were somewhat simple, they were so elaborate that you didn't really think twice about it, nothing was really left for your own imagination.
0.51 	 You cry, you laugh, you hate and you identify.
0.83 	 I don't know about you guys, but that does not happen that often.
1.0 	 poor Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother.
0.92 	 The settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure.
0.52 	 Tom, you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank!
0.96 	 It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all downhill from there.
0.97 	 Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai.
0.75 	 I want 2+ hours of my life refunded.
0.8 	 Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was "controversial" - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect.
1.0 	 Their previous collaboration on the first season's "Homecoming" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways.
0.6 	 The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it.
0.68 	 Why everyone else hates that is beyond me.<br /><br />Character development was fine.
0.95 	 for you who don't like it, obviously wasn't paying attention.
0.57 	 Pabst, but I think it's a better one.
0.96 	 Woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) chases Man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) for father (Charles Winninger as B.J.).
0.76 	 Woman wants to get Man to invest some of deceased mother's money in father's business venture; but, father is notorious for losing money on hair-brained schemes.
0.55 	 <br /><br />*** Woman Chases Man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
0.75 	 The plot is well worn, and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in.
0.71 	 The plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go.
0.97 	 It's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie.
0.83 	 There are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic - it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in.
0.67 	 It does not excel in any of this things, with the exception of the cars.
0.95 	 The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so the movie ainÂ´t as bad as people are painting it.
0.52 	 I wasnÂ´t always thinking "Is this possible?"
0.93 	 or tramp like that.
0.52 	 Since audiences don't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out, it's a strange choice: the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic.
0.83 	 Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world.
0.88 	 You'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here.<br /><br />This is more like a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe ?
0.51 	 ).
0.99 	 Horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself!
0.75 	 Home Alone was turned from an excellent Christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot!
0.85 	 was finally unearthed for a screening.
0.65 	 Yes, the film has its problems, but the score is not one of them.
1.0 	 Then, too, the 'modern' segment is weakly written.
0.65 	 Not just an athlete, but an artist.
0.99 	 There's absolutely no point of diminishing this star.
0.8 	 Anything I wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend, but readers.....you have to watch this to know what I mean.
0.73 	 I want to read as much as I can about him.
0.78 	 At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it.
0.75 	 But I am not surprised.
0.96 	 I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing.
0.51 	 However, I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes.
0.99 	 Yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky Beverly Garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered.
0.94 	 Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral.
0.7 	 I would say for it's time, this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it.
0.75 	 I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving.
0.67 	 I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!!
0.75 	 (The flea is dressed in a farmer's-type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name "A. Flea" on it.)
1.0 	 ")<br /><br />That sets up the storyline of this cute-but-obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog.
1.0 	 The poor pooch, under a threat of having to take a bath, as to NOT react when the stupid flea causes him pain.
0.91 	 It's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes, jackhammers and the like on the dog.
0.79 	 this one of the only movies I've seen that I felt warped my mind because after seeing it I was afraid of Reaper coming to kill me through my computer screen.
0.9 	 this movie just has so much suspense and it made me wanting more because I never thought a low budget TV movie could be so powerful.
0.54 	 If you ever see this movie come on TV, I'd watch it.
0.88 	 but, "What have I learned from this experience?"
0.73 	 They're about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible.
0.93 	 That's what makes them SCARY.<br /><br />- White people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.<br /><br />- If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know.
0.59 	 Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, "What was that?"
0.92 	 "<br /><br />- Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.<br /><br />- A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from "student film" to "major studio release".
0.77 	 I you are used to watching Hollywood "action" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed.
0.99 	 I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act.
0.82 	 But as i have seen the "making of" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes.
0.99 	 I don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him.
0.98 	 Academy nominations for both
 STAT!
0.62 	 'How she move.'
0.57 	 The 1.6/10 should tell it all.
1.0 	 The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness.
0.97 	 The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair.
0.99 	 Peace to the Palestinian was freedom.
0.68 	 Peace to the Israeli was security.
0.51 	 With such an abyss, is this sort of film really worth much?
1.0 	 Dullsville.<br /><br />My favorite parts: where the "office girl" makes with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards into a 087 sorter.
0.67 	 Unbelievable.
0.7 	 The story is incredibly obvious: A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and, in turn, they start to live out the lives of the characters they play.
0.87 	 I've been watching a lot of movies lately, thanks to Netflix, and this is the first one I haven't watched all the way through in a long time.
0.97 	 That being said, I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture.
0.95 	 I haven't seen Mel Gibson's version, but I'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this, except for the most conservative.
1.0 	 I just wish this was a better film.<br /><br />Lots of these reviews praise Arcand's direction and especially the cinematography.
0.8 	 And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal.<br /><br />There were two examples of this that come easily to mind.
0.97 	 I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach.
0.78 	 Please stop hitting me over the head with this high-handed "significance."
0.9 	 The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who, eventually, turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays-corrupt Church.
0.93 	 "It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain."
0.88 	 It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters.
1.0 	 As the years passed Lady Tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve/refine her awkward, unattractive daughters (to call them "homely" would be an insult to homely people everywhere) while all three relegated Cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house, abusing her, mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get (they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload).
0.66 	 Cindy arrives at the ball, the Prince falls hard for her, but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way, forcing her to flee, but leaving behind a glass slipper.
0.99 	 Of course, if this were being made now, Cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax (either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window) but this is beside the point.<br /><br />And for all those who say Cinderella sets a bad example for young girls, well, consider this - at least Cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed, unlike some modern day "princesses" (you know who I mean).
0.64 	 I claim no matter how hard I seek I'll never find a better movie version of "Othello".
0.94 	 He gives the audience more of the same <br /><br />Young Jimmy Spud lives on some kitchen sink estate .
0.8 	 He is bullied at school and no one loves him .
0.72 	 The only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer .
0.88 	 No actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer .
0.85 	 He has a macho waster of a father who thinks " Ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says " Ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet .
0.94 	 This grainy film has a cult following and one of those word-of-mouth features you just had to see.
0.97 	 Maybe hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, that knows the legend is true.
0.74 	 This tale is told in documentary-style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved.
0.89 	 The legend changes with the telling, but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek.
0.87 	 I'll leave you to guess which one it was to be.<br /><br />I had to keep checking the cover of the DVD to confirm that this really was made by credible talents.
0.95 	 I cannot understand why Robert Altman would take this job.
0.87 	 Surely he has some power to pick and chose.
1.0 	 As for Robert Altman, plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic.
0.97 	 I found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene, or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye's movements, or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood.
0.89 	 I do not typically notice such things in movies, since most movies I bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story-telling and interesting characters with understandable motives.
0.98 	 His fame bewilders me.
0.62 	 Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess').
0.76 	 It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby).
1.0 	 I disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted.
0.99 	 I had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before).
0.58 	 What more do you want?
0.91 	 The relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not.
0.96 	 Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed.
0.93 	 Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean).
0.99 	 What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glass's soundtrack.
0.96 	 I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi.
0.76 	 There was a court battle with the "White Zombie" film's rights owners, who didn't want the Halperins to be able to use the word 'zombie' in this title.
0.96 	 Be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own.<br /><br />THE LAME PLOT: Man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous.
1.0 	 This movie makes the racially insensitive "King of the Zombies" (which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought) seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic.
1.0 	 The credits list the ironically named company Favorite Films.
0.99 	 I'm not sure whose favorite film this would be, but they're obviously an idiot.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance, or classic films.
0.72 	 The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count.
1.0 	 The ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable.
0.96 	 <br /><br />But so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and oh how good.
0.73 	 But even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along.
0.77 	 This is a standing-up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only.
0.97 	 Hey, somehow I've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions.
1.0 	 Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one.<br /><br />DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS!
0.76 	 and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus.
0.88 	 This whole main plot isn't very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines, which just adds to the frustration.
1.0 	 It's cheesy, it's hard-edged, it's not up to par with the first two 'Harry' pictures, but hey, there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the .44.
0.89 	 It's a completely unique urban piece, where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much.<br /><br />It's central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race, background and station.
0.71 	 But to proclaim that THE theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope.
1.0 	 Still it doesn't feel at all stuffy.
0.51 	 The more people who see this film, the better.
1.0 	 So, Fox pulled the plug midway through a drama/mystery...<br /><br />How lame is that?
0.73 	 They were broadcast elsewhere.<br /><br />Hey, Fox!
0.71 	 Are you listening?
0.95 	 If you're going to introduce new drama/mysteries, at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme.
0.68 	 It is a vicious cycle.
0.8 	 Don't let us down again...
0.63 	 But that's where most of the comparisons end.
0.9 	 Small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks.
0.59 	 Sgt.
0.91 	 He's the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession.
0.98 	 One night, he goes too far and accidentally kills a man.
0.97 	 As the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster.<br /><br />Recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening.
0.71 	 It's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal.
0.92 	 Sure its clear that its all fake, but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief?
0.61 	 If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther.
0.9 	 I also think that to truly critique this movie, one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made.
0.65 	 The entire story was well thought out.
0.96 	 The Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for launching, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first.
0.83 	 The problem is, to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys.
0.88 	 Cool.
0.51 	 Huh?!
0.9 	 I'm sure I didn't get some inside jokes, but some I knew, and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after I'd stopped laughing.
0.99 	 Haunted Boat sells itself as 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'.
1.0 	 In many ways this is accurate.
0.54 	 Showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film.
1.0 	 Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability.
0.52 	 When you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on.<br /><br />Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange.
0.97 	 In terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well.
0.53 	 And are willing to wait the 1hr 35 minutes for the climax.<br /><br />This is no Ghost Ship but it'll definitely do for an evening in front of the T.V.
0.7 	 I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan.
0.95 	 I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura.
0.7 	 I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as Sandler made me.
0.69 	 Ever.
1.0 	 The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen.
0.98 	 <br /><br />I will give it a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.<br /><br />4/10
0.85 	 This is the kind of movie i fear the most.
0.89 	 This series was CBS networks answer to the success of the Big Valley.
0.75 	 For example- in one episode, Johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick.
0.56 	 Amazingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had healed entirely.
0.88 	 Along with that, the stories on this were no where near as strong as The Big Valley.<br /><br />This is a show that I would not want DVDs of, & frankly hope they are never released.
1.0 	 Think since CBS was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings.
0.88 	 This was one the last western series CBS produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's.
0.86 	 First let me be honest.
0.89 	 But alas...<br /><br />it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to "Braveheart".
0.73 	 Yet, this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that "Braveheart" is a better film than "Rob Roy".
0.78 	 I like "Braveheart" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to "Rob Roy" is a little insulting to me.
0.99 	 When he finally does fail, it is not to his fault.
0.94 	 But it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me.
0.78 	 Let us start though, with how she looks in this film.
0.89 	 Now these two ladies are hot, but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons).
0.88 	 She feels compelled to tell Rob of her struggle, but doesn't because she knows that Rob must seek revenge for her rape.
1.0 	 He is shamefully self obsessed and insecure.
0.55 	 Callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical.
0.74 	 He will do anything to maintain the good will of the Marquis, which includes backstabbing and trickery.
1.0 	 He is very much like the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.<br /><br />Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as overacting.
0.85 	 Hogwash I say.
0.57 	 It is clear that Cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film.
0.8 	 First of all, battle scenes are hardly original.
0.97 	 These battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, duels are hardly original either.
0.92 	 I feel that many people are bored by "Rob Roy" simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying.
0.86 	 If this is the case, then read some Shakesphere, or put on the close-captioning.
0.64 	 This is a legend, and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times.
0.93 	 Thus the reason that many people like it better.
0.87 	 Audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex.
0.65 	 Hardly.
0.58 	 You can make a decision on what you think is better...<br /><br />Grade - A Score - 9
0.52 	 The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much at the premiere.
0.82 	 That's never a good sign.
0.79 	 The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates/bandmates.
1.0 	 The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie.
0.9 	 What takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation, panic, fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances.
0.61 	 spilling from your tongue, and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions.
0.78 	 Rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential, but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point.Zero Day indeed....zzzzzzzzzzzzz
0.79 	 I await the day when someone makes a decent film from a Steven King novel (with the exception, possibly, of Stand by Me).
0.83 	 ); her two snarling lieutenants (one of them a sluttish black girl) are especially irritating.<br /><br />Aiding Lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes (he being the brother of the Dee Wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers) and a ragged guerrilla-type band of Transylvians (still, they generally manage to effortlessly overcome Danning's rather dumb werewolves!).
1.0 	 This was not enjoyable to watch.
0.9 	 The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious.
0.91 	 It left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker.
0.99 	 When I started watching the show I said "Oh, no!
0.99 	 It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!".
1.0 	 I absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him.
0.94 	 I would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny (it comes for free on the 3rd disc).
0.99 	 Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Papel Chase.
0.78 	 You'll see one that's really sappy, and you'll think you want something more realistic.
0.95 	 Then, you'll see one that's realistic, but it might be too dull to keep you interested.
0.76 	 For the rest of us, I say, "See _A Guy Thing_."
0.67 	 It's a lot of fun.<br /><br />Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're going in to this movie with expectations, so it doesn't pretend that its "Guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams, and it's not his wife!"
1.0 	 Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel.
0.73 	 Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.)
0.98 	 The movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go-more so by todays standards, no body parts flying off as in modern movies.
0.93 	 Once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything.
0.91 	 The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies.
0.95 	 Aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in LA.
0.73 	 They look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes.
0.99 	 Looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll, and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack.
1.0 	 This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog.
1.0 	 All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece.
1.0 	 The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The transfer on 'Follow The Fleet' is a tad weaker.
0.59 	 Considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of Astaire/Rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from Warner Home Video.
0.82 	 After last week seeing Mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of Annie and Brandi I almost puked.
0.98 	 But that was nothing until seeing Mellisa's tirade after being fired.
1.0 	 She continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes "all of them" like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits.
0.54 	 Mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums?
0.84 	 Mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview, just proves to America what everyone thought, you are a spoiled baby.
0.57 	 WAH WAH I can't get my way!
0.98 	 And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all.
0.63 	 Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning.
0.97 	 A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife.
0.96 	 The story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version.
0.88 	 However, I don't mind.
1.0 	 In fact, I rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does.
0.79 	 I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment.
1.0 	 It looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the London Meat Co.
1.0 	 It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes.
1.0 	 This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie...
0.71 	 I am attempting to watch all things Star Trek.
0.71 	 Having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how a couple of them were re-shot because the film looked better.
0.68 	 Up until this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it.
0.54 	 What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club?
0.87 	 If he had, he could have called it The Razor's Edge, since the Katha-Upanishad tells us, "The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard."
0.74 	 But Maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class, and so we have Darryl F. Zanuck's version of Larry Darrell, recently returned from WWI, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner.
0.79 	 <br /><br />Or, as Maugham tells us, "This is the young man of whom I write.
0.99 	 He is not famous.
1.0 	 Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men, so that, long after his death, perhaps, it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature."
0.99 	 <br /><br />The Razor's Edge has all of Zanuck's cultural taste that money could buy.
0.97 	 It's so earnest, so sincere...so self-important.
1.0 	 As Larry goes about his search for wisdom, working in mines, on merchant ships, climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man, we have his selfish girl friend, Isabel, played by Gene Tierney, his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter, the girlfriend's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb, and Willie Maugham himself, played by Herbert Marshall, taking notes.
1.0 	 Webb has some good lines, but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb, not Elliot Templeton.
0.99 	 <br /><br />Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maugham's novel.
0.82 	 He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service.
1.0 	 He's going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face.
1.0 	 "My dear," Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor, "Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get.
1.0 	 You see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in the world...and he's got it!"
0.86 	 Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine.
1.0 	 To see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore, Trio and Quartet.
1.0 	 The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.
1.0 	 "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's Cube with Kitamura's own Versus."
1.0 	 I have not seen Versus, so I can't comment on that, but I think Cube was an excellent movie which I recommend to everyone.
0.57 	 This apparently makes sense because they're both deserts so surely they're practically the same place.
0.51 	 What ever.
0.76 	 Then everyone dies.
0.9 	 "Gee THANKS A FREAKIN' HEAP."
0.89 	 ...and not in a good way.
0.96 	 It is offensive to all the senses.
1.0 	 "Airplane" was a revolutionary and very funny comedy, watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.<br /><br />I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
1.0 	 These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today.
0.99 	 Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny.
0.85 	 It's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity.
0.98 	 I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons.
0.96 	 The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.<br /><br />Parker and Stone have never been great actors.
0.86 	 Instead we get potty humor.
0.99 	 The singer dies, but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at, of course, midnight on Halloween (which would actually make it November 1st, a much less potent date to be sure).
0.97 	 The kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back-play messages.
1.0 	 We see the metal kid (the outsider) tormented over and over by the popular kids.
0.99 	 And he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies: When the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party, DON'T GO!
0.56 	 Especially if it is a pool party.
0.67 	 Anybody surprised when he ends up in the water??
1.0 	 A sensitive hero?
0.94 	 What fun is that in a horror movie?
0.59 	 Thank goodness Carrie White did not follow this lesson.
0.67 	 He actually tries to PREVENT having the music played at the Halloween Dance, the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him.
1.0 	 It seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a Molly Ringwald film.
0.92 	 If you went to high school in the late 80s like I did, this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair, but that is it for this film.
0.83 	 Skip it and stay home and just listen to some KISS.
0.98 	 After I saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room.
0.84 	 This could be looked at in many different ways.
0.99 	 The third one probably explains this movie best.
0.73 	 Christopher Walken is always off the wall.
0.85 	 He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is.
0.67 	 Comedy wise it is somewhat funny.
0.97 	 At best it is below average.
0.99 	 He is always quite a character in his movies.
0.99 	 <br /><br />On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film.
0.99 	 Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young.
0.83 	 Story-wise, the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes.
1.0 	 That was amazing and humorous footage.<br /><br />Overall, I can see where this film - Garbo's last - was not a box-office success.
1.0 	 Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc.
0.76 	 Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire?
0.99 	 (SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term loosely) that I've been trying to watch for over a year.
0.99 	 He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home.
0.59 	 The guys mafia mom sends her men out to get revenge while the cops begin looking for him as well.<br /><br />Very little is said.
0.98 	 It looks good, is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film.
0.92 	 Hell, I would have liked some sense of real character development or back story (all we know is that the guy was picked on as a kid).
0.63 	 No instead we get the hero on a boat.
0.99 	 The hero in a bus, the hero walking, the hero looking disturbed.Hero with his girl.
0.96 	 Only for those who want to see a brooding Russian action film with very little action
0.77 	 Oh just what I needed,another movie about 19th century England.
1.0 	 I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it.
1.0 	 The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy.
0.83 	 The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men.
0.98 	 Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls.
0.99 	 You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties!
0.83 	 I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit.
0.81 	 I don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show.
0.68 	 I would have her babies.
0.87 	 And I am female.
0.83 	 Read the comics you won't regret it.
0.99 	 Any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane, or does not like women, or you know just plan insane.
0.69 	 Or at least the feeling: that you have to break every rule if you are to break one.
0.87 	 Are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self.
0.99 	 Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting, see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee?
0.97 	 It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men.
0.99 	 Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious.
0.8 	 <br /><br />When Roberts left.
0.93 	 It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza.
0.64 	 Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.<br /><br />And if they weren't real, they should have been.
0.84 	 This short is a puzzlement.
0.86 	 This be an odd one, gang.
1.0 	 The omission of "In Cold Blood" in 1967 as one of the five Best Picture nominees is one of those inexplicable instances, especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable "Dr.
0.96 	 While there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen, the film is definitely adult material.
0.83 	 This lack of balance comes from the book as Capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row.
0.54 	 However, whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment, "In Cold Blood" will leave you mired deep in conflicting thoughts.
0.77 	 In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings.
0.82 	 I have loved her work since "For Roseanna".<br /><br />With most movies, one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc.
0.93 	 All the people who had cameos in this (including John Landis)are lucky they still have careers.
0.98 	 The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out-act the people in the movie.
0.84 	 Went to see the movie "Troy" this afternoon.
0.89 	 Here's what I learned:<br /><br />Contrary to popular opinion and history in general, Greek men were not gay.
0.98 	 So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie.<br /><br />Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup.
0.71 	 She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which, though numerous, were probably all filmed on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, "Alright, now look beautiful .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.94 	 good ... OK, now look frightened ... good... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.97 	 good ... now look beautiful again ... good..."<br /><br />Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents.
0.88 	 "<br /><br />Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way up.<br /><br />Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it's OK.
0.8 	 They were cousins.
0.86 	 I mean, the direction was really in touch with it's subject.
0.94 	 The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life.
0.98 	 This is an interesting left turn for Reel 13 Indies.
0.98 	 TWO HARBORS is a B&W 75 minute film from Minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life.
0.96 	 I applaud the boldness of the Reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film.
0.96 	 I just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with.
1.0 	 <br /><br />As is common with independent films, TWO HARBORS is limited in terms of location.
0.86 	 Writer/director James Vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about Vic, who is one of the dealers there.
0.92 	 He has various people walk up to Vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information Â Vic sells space toys (he prefers to call them "outer space action figures") and he is a caustic asshole.
0.99 	 This is emblematic of one of the two key problems with TWO HARBORS - all the chatting.
0.99 	 I've said it before and I'll say it again Â we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually.
0.71 	 A notable example would be a few scenes which feature Vic trying to play himself off as a Boy Scout leader in order to get a discount at a store.
0.96 	 There are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on low-budget projects Â even in Minnesota.
0.76 	 Many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is naÃ¯ve.
0.96 	 In narrative film-making, next to the story, nothing is more important than the acting/performances.
0.58 	 big).
0.97 	 Granted, the best of the actors were the two leads Â Cole and Catherine E. Johnson as Cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in Vic's extra-terrestrial hunt.
0.7 	 They seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges.
0.77 	 The eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real, organic place within.
0.97 	 Ms. Johnson, in particular, is an interesting case.
1.0 	 She definitely has a presence Â a Midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have.
0.98 	 She struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and (slave?)
1.0 	 After that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful Â it's like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way.
0.87 	 It's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters.
1.0 	 The last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film Â subtle, detailed (Cole does his best work of the film) and most importantly, cinematic.
1.0 	 Then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all Â that it's based on a true story, which got me to thinking.
0.95 	 There might be something to this story after all

0.91 	 Watching this last night it amazed me that Fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment.
0.77 	 It's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />I'm sure that the first morning of filming Raquel Welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the Academy Award she would surely win for this daringly original movie.
0.56 	 That's not what happened.<br /><br />The infighting on the set was detailed in print by Rex Reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released.
0.85 	 An impressive supporting cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do.<br /><br />To expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from Fox movies featuring stars like Carmen Miranda (in amazing footage from THE GANG'S ALL HERE) andLaurel and Hardy, who never dreamed they'd be playing in an X rated movie.<br /><br />The X rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seem to be having any fun.
0.92 	 Sixtyish, once honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger made movies like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience.
0.97 	 Those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never, as best I know, been out on home video or cable.
0.99 	 They're the studios' deep dark secret.<br /><br />Raquel Welch's performance in this is, all things considered, very good.
0.99 	 With the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in.
1.0 	 She looks great and has awesome costumes.
1.0 	 Mae West is the liveliest seventy-something actress I've ever seen.
0.96 	 On the one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by, but I'm sure she needed the money.<br /><br />If you want to see a big budget X-rated movie from this era check out BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (also from Fox) because it doesn't take itself seriously.
0.97 	 It's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio.
0.96 	 I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800's.
0.52 	 The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy.
1.0 	 They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800's.
0.95 	 I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks!
0.97 	 Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night.
0.82 	 You'd think her parents would have been worried.
0.64 	 And maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story.
0.61 	 10 out of 10.
0.99 	 It's a thoroughly well made film that stands up well to this day.
0.91 	 However, given that the modern day remake machine is currently in full swing; I really can't say I'm surprised to see the film updated for modern audience.
0.99 	 The plot remains identical to the original film and at its core we have the story of a young man, Milo Tindle, who goes off to see an older man, Andrew Wyke, to discuss a divorce as the younger man is having an affair with the older man's wife.
0.63 	 From there, a game of cat and mouse ensues.
0.92 	 Its clear right from the outset that director Kenneth Branagh wanted to add a different touch to this film and he does so by way of the central location, which has been changed from the charming games-ridden country house of the original to a technical marvel kitted out with layers of security equipment.
0.8 	 I'm glad that the director chose to make this change as nobody wants to see a remake that directly copies of the original; plus there's the fact that the location is well used and always nice to look at.
0.65 	 The plot is also rushed and we get into the first twist in the tale far too quickly and before we are given any chance to actually understand why and how these events can be taking place.
0.97 	 The film does not build the characters, or the rapport between them, enough to make sure that their relationship makes sense.
0.98 	 One major thing that has been changed about the older character is his obsession; in the original he was obsessed with games which turned out to be VERY important once the twists come into play.
1.0 	 Kenneth Branagh's handling of the film allows for a classy score but the class ends there.
0.98 	 After spending two hours with the original I understood, respected and liked both characters presented in the film - after eighty minutes of this, I hated them both.
0.57 	 As I recall it went to air on Friday (or possibly Saturday)night on the Nine Network (?)
0.66 	 i think that it's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all.
0.63 	 Haim Bouzaglo, the director of the film, plays the role of Haim Bouzaglo, artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright, who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend's documentary.
0.97 	 But the bomber has already struck and Haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier.
1.0 	 Nor is there any difficulty locating Bouzaglo's ultimate targetÂenervated and impotent Israel, fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action.
1.0 	 Israel is Bouzaglo, the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play.
0.96 	 Israel is also the bankrupt soldier-entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker's documentary, the cheating actors and actresses, and the cuckolded husband.
0.99 	 They are all Israel because they are all helpless, caught in inaction or aimless action, as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target.
0.79 	 ... Oxford, Mississippi, at least.
0.8 	 The story needn't detain us any more than the anomalies -Kelly hasn't got change of a match and is a painter, i.e.
0.82 	 Fenton, the older boy, is horrified, seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer.
0.78 	 We've got to do this."
0.93 	 When Fenton, terrified and convinced his father has gone mad, says he'll report him to the police, his father explains, "If you do that, son, I'll die.
0.84 	 The angel was clear on this."
0.59 	 I wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story, until I remembered the real-life parallel of Andrea Yates, who believed she was possessed by Satan and could save her children by drowning them.
0.99 	 And this, as much as some plot holes, posed a problem for me.
0.85 	 They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town.
0.87 	 The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.<br /><br />Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney films.
0.52 	 Some time in the late 19th century, somewhere in the American West, several cowboys in need of money go on a buffalo hunt.
0.86 	 The group's leader believes that buffaloes are too numerous for the hunting to have any impact, but the more experienced hunter has seen how quickly the population can collapse, and he isn't so sure.
0.73 	 Sandy, his "brother", is the experienced hunter who is tired of killing but needs the job after losing his cattle.
0.86 	 A half-Indian boy, who hates the fact that he looks entirely Caucasian, takes the role of adopted son.
0.89 	 He is mean and insulting towards everyone around him, yet at the same time he knows that they are the only family and friends that he has.
0.85 	 He expects the abducted Indian women to hate him, then accept him, but he doesn't know how to react when she refuses to do either.
0.99 	 As one might expect, this movie suffers by comparison.
0.52 	 Charlie is so thoroughly unlikable from the very beginning that we never have any reason to care about what happens to him or his family.
0.85 	 Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline.
0.99 	 Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end.
0.9 	 I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot.
0.61 	 True, some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people, but they are not necessarily angry like of Marlee Matlin's character was throughout the story.
0.68 	 It will put me to sleep.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is a deaf guy talking.
0.53 	 This sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb.
0.52 	 I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves.
0.99 	 Instead you get something quite different, more psychological, more something like from David Lynch.
0.99 	 But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter's suicide and the aftermath.
0.66 	 <br /><br />Now that would have been cool!
1.0 	 This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy.
0.74 	 It is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy.
0.98 	 The only saving graces are the competent performance by Toni Collete and the frequency with which we glimpse Paltrow's pleasant face.
0.97 	 My main problem with the film is that it goes on too long.
0.94 	 Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage.
1.0 	 They live with Muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad.
0.6 	 When he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing.
1.0 	 When they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before.
0.95 	 India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc, etc.
0.68 	 Just a bunch of footage of third-worlders with "baskets on their heads" as another reviewer said.
0.99 	 If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot, and film in Mexico.
0.8 	 That would have been a much better setting for "life in transformation.
0.8 	 This is also backed-up by odd scenes (e.g.
0.58 	 This reminds me of the 'Python (I think) quote about Shakespere, of his 'comedies' - If he had meant it to be humorous he would have put a joke in it.
0.5 	 Rose tries her luck at being a comedian.
0.91 	 And Meredith...what exactly does she do again?
0.7 	 <br /><br />I was surprised about how good the writing was.
0.88 	 The little jokes thrown in by Mary and Rhoda were funny.
0.65 	 But I had no idea that they worked this well as a team.
0.87 	 (During the run of this movie.)
0.86 	 (The newer version of the MTM theme song doesn't hurt either.)
0.56 	 Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder.
0.74 	 The quote (or scene) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of "all this plumbing ... you haven't learned my secrets at all" and threatens to storm out, the Scientist answers him in a single word "Thalassa" -- salt water which horrifies the Fiction Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood.
0.96 	 The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching "28 Days later" and "Magnolia".
0.51 	 !
0.81 	 It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute.
0.9 	 The creepy local color guy.
0.92 	 The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films.
0.75 	 The action never stops.
0.75 	 When i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie, but sense i am such a big Luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance.
0.7 	 Whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me.
1.0 	 Many of the lead characters in Hideo Gosha's 1969 film "Hitokiri" (manslayer; aka "Tenchu" -- heaven's punishment) were actual historical figures (in "western" name-order format): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenokoji.
1.0 	 The name "Hitokiri," a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate in the mid-1800s under the orders of Takechi, the leader of the "Loyalist" (i.e.
1.0 	 ultra-nationalist, pro-Emperor) faction of the Tosa clan.
0.5 	 What was this struggle about?
0.97 	 Sakamoto, for example, was someone of historical significance, considered to be the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
0.99 	 The closest Gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the Loyalist cause, comes to Takechi's mansion to try to sway him ideologically.
0.88 	 Want to know more?
0.96 	 Gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence(!).
0.99 	 For the two and a half centuries that the Shogunate held central power in Japan, it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change, to preserving the feudal relations of society.
0.8 	 It was fearful of outside contamination, both ideological and technological.
0.99 	 In keeping with this spirit, it outlawed firearms, those instruments of "leveling" in Europe and the Americas, with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai.
0.95 	 Throughout this period, the Emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead.<br /><br />But, in the towns, which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms, a new class of merchants, landlords and craftsmen was developing -- the class known in Europe by its French name, the bourgeoisie.
1.0 	 Inevitably, as this new class gained strength, it chafed against the many confines of feudal society.
0.98 	 As in Europe, the king (Emperor) became the central figure in the bourgeoisie's struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy.
0.98 	 But a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves.
0.98 	 When the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853, in the form of U.S. Admiral Perry's "Black Ships," the ruling elite of Japan was thrown into a crisis.
0.7 	 Also, they had heard about the havoc the British and French imperialists were wreaking in China.
0.9 	 Surprisingly, some elements within the usually isolationist Shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology.
0.96 	 This is the point of view represented (just barely) in the film by Sakamoto.
0.96 	 (Sound familiar?)
0.99 	 Thus, the assassination of key Shogunate figures is in order -- and away we go.<br /><br />Takechi's motivations were, for me, the film's biggest puzzle.
0.81 	 Gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the Loyalist cause.
0.74 	 Can we take this to represent the tenor of the Loyalists as a whole?
0.96 	 )<br /><br />Several reviewers have compared this film favorably with "Goyokin," which Gosha made in the same year.
0.98 	 But, where "Goyokin" is a crackling, suspenseful, adventure yarn, with a hero worthy of sympathy, "Hitokiri" is plodding, nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero.
0.77 	 Sakamoto could have been this film's hero but we are not allowed to know him -- nor what he stands for -- well enough for him to achieve that status.<br /><br />In view of his wonderful scores for five previous Kurosawa films, Masaru Sato's score here was very disappointing, sounding like something rejected from a "Bonanza" episode.<br /><br />Barry Freed
1.0 	 I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker.
0.5 	 The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing.<br /><br />This show was well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it.<br /><br />rating: 8/10
0.5 	 I give it an 8.
0.99 	 Most of the other reviews tell the general plot (not all correct) so I won't bother to bore anyone with that.
1.0 	 People complain about the movie being too simple or too boring.
0.95 	 I think they should just stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I actually like B movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.
0.98 	 One note: If you notice this, this has exactly the same actors from Cube except four actors.
0.87 	 Make it two notes: Wait after the credits (Trust me on this one).
0.75 	 They have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way ...if that makes any sense.
0.81 	 Once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever, you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed.
0.51 	 That is apparent in BASEketball.
0.99 	 Although it is directed by David Zucker and is utterly rediculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the disgrace that is major league sports.
0.85 	 I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
0.97 	 The only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars.
1.0 	 Hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending.
0.98 	 I mean firstly I love Seagal.
0.98 	 I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s.
1.0 	 His early stuff is some of the best in the genre.
0.99 	 This however does not live up to its excellent name.
0.96 	 Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight.
0.98 	 There's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug.
0.94 	 This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera!
0.99 	 "Revenge is a two way street" seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!
0.8 	 And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" so good.
0.75 	 Well done.
0.97 	 I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark.
0.55 	 The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it.
0.55 	 The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines.
0.99 	 I had a lot of fun watching it.
0.81 	 "Bullfighter" was made in 2000 but it is being released on video 5 years later for some reason.
0.93 	 I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) go on a mystical road trip.
0.97 	 The movie looks great and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance.
0.86 	 I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /><br />1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: " I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo " and " I'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed " <br /><br />2 ) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won <br /><br />Last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better )but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but .
0.95 	 So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne !
1.0 	 There's no such thing as a " minor " Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they're as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director .
0.86 	 All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium .
0.99 	 As for the awards themselves <br /><br />Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett .
1.0 	 No great surprise for a competitive category <br /><br />Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman .
1.0 	 No real complaints since Freeman is one of America's greatest living character actors <br /><br />Best Actor - Jamie Foxx .
0.99 	 Yawn <br /><br />Best Actress - Hilary Swank .
0.99 	 Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night <br /><br />Best Director - Clint Eastwood .
0.79 	 Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one .
0.94 	 Actually I'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /><br />Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY .
1.0 	 Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off <br /><br />What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd's sake !
0.93 	 And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts
0.57 	 This movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today.
0.5 	 Watch the 1936 version.
0.81 	 This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive.
0.98 	 where would one start a review of the film Snitch'd?
0.63 	 YUCK!
0.51 	 i feel the world of film is much less from James' passing, his memory will linger on and on and on, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, Snitch'd.
0.99 	 i'll tell you why, because thats life in Santa Ana baby, its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices, oh no.
0.81 	 Wes Craven, you are having a laugh... at our expense.
0.72 	 2. car.
0.6 	 RR
0.97 	 If anyone I see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
0.96 	 As far as I can tell you, in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors, this film IS currently available on DVD.
0.98 	 Thanks to the BBC for this show.
0.71 	 I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me.
0.83 	 After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented.
1.0 	 The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive!
0.58 	 The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak, who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world.
0.99 	 He was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the Cold War, he even begged the Soviet Union to nuke New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world.
0.98 	 Incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation.
0.65 	 THAT WOULD MAKE AN Oscar WINNING FILM!
0.92 	 I thought making independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING!
0.94 	 Oooh, how daring, how mind blowing.
1.0 	 Tres anti-mainstream and edgy.
0.99 	 That would be truly daring!
0.98 	 They are strikingly similar.<br /><br />The movie is almost identical.
0.62 	 What would it be showed like?
0.94 	 Only sex...
0.94 	 Sure some of the visuals were nice, but c'mon guys, I mean really!
0.9 	 And for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of.
0.76 	 Mainly this film managed to bore me, and creep me out at the same time.<br /><br />I'm glad its over.
0.68 	 I'll tell you what.
0.59 	 I mean what are we supposed to believe is going through Jake's head when they offer him their "solution" to his problem?
0.77 	 <br /><br />Anyway, I can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films

.
0.51 	 bulls**t!
0.52 	 Maybe he never wanted the film to be funny, and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy, but what was he planning on hanging this film on may I ask?
0.79 	 I sincerely hope not!<br /><br />By far the most satisfying moment I went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end.
0.72 	 Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.<br /><br />Like many French films, 'READ MY LIPS' appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything.
0.79 	 The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.<br /><br />It was the French 'New Wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and I've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.
1.0 	 So I finally bought it off e-bay, thinking right from the start it was going to suck.
1.0 	 Actually, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.
0.61 	 It skips quite a lot of things, since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into one two hour movie.
0.69 	 Definatley worth a watch, kids might like, but still, absoutley no comparision with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
1.0 	 Wow, what a great cast!
0.8 	 Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Christopher Walken, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Hank Azaria...what's that?
0.99 	 America's Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another.
0.91 	 I've been working pretty hard lately, and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names, right?
0.56 	 I'm just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can."
0.83 	 Also, I'm a fan of the likable Adam West.
1.0 	 Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age.
0.52 	 The bikers here look like a motley group and I sure wouldn't want them to date my sister.
0.86 	 Its justification is like any other epic's: bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it.
0.99 	 It's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away.
0.98 	 But the real villain is played by Tim Roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character, Archibald - a man who mocks love, who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter.
0.92 	 Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it.
0.82 	 The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience.
0.91 	 That way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is.
0.94 	 However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast.
0.53 	 The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters.
0.8 	 That is all.
0.87 	 The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up.
1.0 	 Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right?
0.57 	 If I were Helen I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
0.71 	 At the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of this film and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever.
0.81 	 In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and they can't act.
0.68 	 That's why there porn stars, if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn.
0.68 	 Just because your beautiful doesn't make you a movie star.
1.0 	 A fine example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth.
0.83 	 Where is she now?
0.9 	 I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then "Dream Quest".
0.69 	 I'm a professional actor and I was flabbergasted by the performances.
0.98 	 They felt totally improvisatory, absolutely without affectation.
0.94 	 I could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the IMDb to find this film.
0.62 	 Do not miss it.
0.95 	 If you're looking for a Hollywood action packed kid-flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for.
0.82 	 I admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production.
0.85 	 Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline/content I'm afraid.
1.0 	 I went into this film with expectations, from the hype, that it would be insightful and uplifting.
0.57 	 They tried their best to make it look like it was a strain, but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't exist.
0.66 	 This doesn't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline, insight or even a decent job at cinematography.
0.68 	 The strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch.<br /><br />From the film, this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don't have and think they're some kind of guardians for the art of music, which they most definitely are not.
0.96 	 It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps.
1.0 	 Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video.
0.73 	 I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie.
0.89 	 If you have to rent a Troma film, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock.
0.99 	 Its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs.
0.98 	 The second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes.
0.87 	 It was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin.
0.98 	 Here's an indie film I really wanted to like, but ultimately could not.
1.0 	 OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever, lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX.
0.51 	 This film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced.
1.0 	 Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I wish him luck.
0.93 	 Even in the 21st century, there are no films I can think of that are anything like it.
0.97 	 The end result seems to be a little of both!
1.0 	 All three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound.
0.8 	 If you "get it", it's magnificent.<br /><br />If you don't, it's decent.<br /><br />Please understand that "getting it" does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting.
0.83 	 Thankfully, the audience is given credit for being human beings; our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy, implausibly moralistic ending.<br /><br />Above and beyond that, I try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that.
0.96 	 Yet I must admit, I cried like a lost little baby during this movie.
1.0 	 But that is not necessarily a bad thing.
0.9 	 I would however disagree with the above comment.
0.82 	 The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish frontier.
0.99 	 This whole storyline is cloth.
0.57 	 As Clevemore comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department.
0.97 	 I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything.
0.94 	 This probably could not be helped but the castle they rented, for the movie, was Austrian.
0.64 	 What?
0.86 	 Is Romy Schneider being portrayed as Scarlet?Where's Mammy?
0.87 	 What was in Marishka mind?Well this add to the camp.It's unintentionally satirizing Queen Victoria'a story.
0.98 	 MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS (1998) Â½* <br /><br />Starring: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language and some violence) <br /><br />By Blake French: <br /><br />	Believe it or not, in the new John Warren comedy "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS" there is one funny scene.
0.75 	 Even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got.
0.89 	 At least "Air Bud" was family oriented.
0.95 	 "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon.
0.68 	 Teenagers?
0.76 	 Elderly?
1.0 	 People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?<br /><br />	The film, like many others like this, has one basic point it tries to make: teamwork conquers all.
0.97 	 Yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove.
0.62 	 Where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name.
0.98 	 The good baseball team is on a comeback, they are about to win and--the power goes out.
0.85 	 The player's reaction is to die for.
0.57 	 But that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time, and certainly is not worth a cent of your money.
0.92 	 Watch The Pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest.
0.72 	 After his death in 1938, however, it was revealed that he had not been who he claimed to be; his real name was Archibald Belaney, and he had been born in the English seaside town of Hastings.<br /><br />The film departs somewhat from the facts of Grey Owl's life.
0.67 	 (46 would have been Pierce Brosnan's age when the film was made, so I am not sure why this change was made).
0.94 	 His supposed deceit was even used to discredit the causes which he had championed.
0.53 	 He was accepted by the Ojibway as a member of their tribe.
0.88 	 It therefore seems unfair to describe his claim to a Native North American identity as being a fraudulent one, merely because it was an identity he had chosen rather than one he had been born into.<br /><br />According to the film, Grey Owl's wife Gertrude was herself of Indian descent, but came from a family which had been assimilated into white Canadian culture.
0.98 	 She was clearly influenced by her husband, but she also had an influence on him, persuading him to give up his work as a fur trapper as she had moral objections to killing animals for their fur.<br /><br />One criticism made of the film is that Pierce Brosnan is "miscast" as the hero, a criticism which seems to be rooted in the preconception that Brosnan can only play action heroes in the James Bond mould.
1.0 	 Brosnan is in fact very good in this role, although I would agree with those who found Annie Galipeau weak as Gertrude.<br /><br />Another frequently-voiced criticism with which I would not agree is that the film is "boring".
0.96 	 This is not 'Bizet's Carmen' by any usual standard.
0.97 	 This is not a usual film by any standard.
0.66 	 Such is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie.
0.99 	 Granted, he's had a lot of resentment festering in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context.
0.55 	 Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau act that way in other movies, but not to George Burns.
0.96 	 And, Matthau's bellowing tends to get a little old.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Matthau: "Wait, wait.
0.7 	 I think you have to slide it."
0.99 	 Well, if you like pop/punk, punk, ska, and a tad bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching.
0.92 	 This movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of goofy death scenes.
0.74 	 Sounds like it may be good, right?
0.99 	 Well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different bands of the Warp Tour and the fans at the event.
0.78 	 Sure, the movie is made by Doug Sakmann from Troma, it's got great low-budget potential, and it tries...but just too hard.
1.0 	 It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board", or any movie you have made with your friends: it's funny to those who made it, and that's about it.<br /><br />Great potential, great idea, great use of effects-but it's the same thing...over and over: A band plays, a band dies, fans die.
0.97 	 That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch.
1.0 	 However, I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone.
0.86 	 Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it.
0.51 	 The other cast members do a fine job as well.<br /><br />Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters?
0.93 	 Have you ever wondered why?
0.98 	 Sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today.<br /><br />
0.87 	 In a slightly twisted story, the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself.
0.77 	 The twisted part?
0.85 	 The handy man is also her daughter's on and off love interest.<br /><br />As if this wasn't strange enough, the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out, she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother.<br /><br />Though you may think badly of this woman, the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light.
1.0 	 Houseboat Horror is a great title for this film.
0.84 	 There are houseboats, there is horror, there's even horror that takes place on houseboats.
0.63 	 You've got highly-annoying youths, intolerant elders, creepy locals (one of whom, a petrol station attendant, would easily win a gurning competition), and let's face it, my description of the murderer could easily be Jason Voorhees.
0.99 	 Ah, but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was Friday The 13th Part VII.
1.0 	 Fans of one-time 'Late Show' and 'Get This' member Tony Martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems ('Check out the view...you'll bar up!
0.64 	 Any fans of 'so-bad-it's-good' horror should not pass up the opportunity.
1.0 	 If, on the other hand, you are in search of genuine excellence in the Australian horror genre, get yourself a copy of the incomparable 'Long Weekend' and don't look back.
0.76 	 This movie was made in Hungary i think.
0.96 	 in other words, not just a one time around flick.
0.59 	 I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD.
0.57 	 As I got older and saw it again I realized that the movie is average.
0.98 	 Compared to movies that are known ad good comedys, this is nothing.
0.88 	 A winters day, 28th December 1986, two bored 14 year olds hire a movie.
0.96 	 Two hours later after watching the film, in a daze, we wanted to know more.
0.94 	 16 years later (and severely out of pocket from collecting JC movies!)
0.72 	 Ok, maybe I have a soft spot for it as it was my "first" (Cannonball Run doesn't count!!)
0.88 	 Some comments say it's dated, it was made in 1985, of course it's dated!
0.68 	 Without movies like Police Story where would Hollywood action be today?
0.72 	 If you haven't already, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!
0.98 	 From the beginning, there is nothing short of an R rating here from the dialog alone.
0.99 	 Stone could also be described as a sort of female Hannibal Lecter, an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan.
0.88 	 Friday the 13th step over!
0.97 	 It is as Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb under a table goes off, and that's surprise.
0.98 	 Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times.
0.98 	 This has been true for thousands of years now.
1.0 	 How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train wreck?
0.89 	 This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon.
0.77 	 It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it obviously dated and kind of silly.<br /><br />The reenactments look like they are out of "Unsolved Mysteries" but without the high production values.
0.7 	 Good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually look for.
0.88 	 The people must be warned!<br /><br />First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero")<br /><br />I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis, and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this movie.
0.97 	 You got Felix Ungar(Jack Lemmon); a hypochondriac, fussy neat-freak, and a big thorn in the side of his roommate, Oscar Madison(Walter Matthau); a total slob.
0.71 	 Well, what can you say?
0.86 	 With an A-List cast, particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub-genre.
0.86 	 Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we're given to believe the gang is Arab-based, also hindered by having to play 90% of the film with a mask over his face.
1.0 	 Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tight-lipped, ice maiden, sub-Clarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bounty-hunter, if you will, to little effect.
0.99 	 Overall it's a real mish-mash of a film, with a light but obvious twist at the end, in fact the title gives it away from the start, spoiler fans.
0.98 	 During the film in-joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like "Serpico" and "Dog Day Afternoon" - but there's no honour in self-praise.
0.97 	 More like "The Hot Rock" instead...and even that was good for a few laughs.
1.0 	 He looks dumb, but he isn't.
0.98 	 Bruce Dern also is in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate in about any film.<br /><br />The movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but I found it fascinating....and I don't like depressing movies normally.
0.94 	 I thought it kicked a*s!
0.88 	 Even if some thought there was too much special FX(yeah right!
0.97 	 ), you can't complain about the cast.
0.58 	 Also when has anyone watched a Dolph Lundgren movie for anything but action?
1.0 	 The country's Islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events, lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour.
0.99 	 They beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match.
0.89 	 The soldiers tell them they shouldn't have tried to get in, that they could have watched the game at home on TV.
0.81 	 Since there are no female restrooms at stadiums, he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in.
0.6 	 Plus, he makes her cover her face so no one can see she's a woman.
0.91 	 One soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family's cattle in the countryside.
0.98 	 If they lost, they would not.
0.79 	 They were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction.
1.0 	 Sure, it starts promisingly, but degenerates into a repetitive, Phillip-Glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen.
0.97 	 After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!
1.0 	 I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor.
0.73 	 The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the South Pole base.
1.0 	 I feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task.
0.9 	 It just makes me assume that if Ingmar Bergman had made this (the drama would suit him!
0.71 	 ), the international attention probably would have been immediate.<br /><br />7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.
0.74 	 There's actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre I was in (about a 100 people in a small art gallery) laughed non-stop for about 40-50 seconds.
0.93 	 It's a film one shouldn't miss.
0.55 	 I do wonder though whatever happened to the real Al Schmid.
0.5 	 We saw none of the tree-lined boulevards...
0.99 	 There was too much darkness, not only literally but figuratively.
0.74 	 Some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed, and let him/her down "flat "(the Marais sequence, the coiffure salesman sequence, to give two examples).
0.99 	 I know the film snobs are snorting.
0.67 	 He adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like Hurt could provide.
0.62 	 And trust me,Wells was an original.
0.94 	 Just as ambitious in scope as "Forrest Gump" was.
0.98 	 But Gump read like an fairy-tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era.
0.52 	 Criminey, talk about heavy-handed.
0.89 	 Why not just give him a t-shirt saying "I Heart Black People"?<br /><br />Sunshine: "Isn't free love groovay, man?
0.7 	 <br /><br />Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA."
0.98 	 Look how we're introduced to the football hero, Randall Floyd.
0.9 	 In fact, we never see him play football.
0.94 	 We're introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.<br /><br />In "Dazed" feminism isn't a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up.
0.5 	 It's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about Gilligan's Island.
0.94 	 Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings.
0.98 	 But real life is like that.<br /><br />Some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant.
0.84 	 However, on the way there, the stage is held up--even though they are not carrying a strongbox.
0.86 	 However, he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk--the typical bad guy from Westerns.
0.92 	 And, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery.
0.84 	 She's a crack shot and it looks bad for Scott--until he figures out why she's come to town.<br /><br />Unlike most later Randolph Scott films, this one shows Scott as a bit more headstrong man.
0.82 	 Second, get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip--now THAT was one impossible feat!
0.99 	 This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre defining MASTERPIECE, Jaws.
0.94 	 Yes, brainiac, great whites(and other species of shark, bull, black-tip, oceanic white-tip, tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found.
0.57 	 It doesn't take a masters from Columbia University to see that.
0.96 	 I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe no, all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future.
0.57 	 I found this a good movie to pass your time, but not by any chance of any historical value.
0.84 	 She gave birth while feeding her people!?!?
0.66 	 They tried to make her appear a saint for God's sake!
0.96 	 And the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister... beyond description.<br /><br />Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time.
0.97 	 Her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals.
0.78 	 She did everything for only two reasons: Power and self-preservation!
0.95 	 She was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival, something she did very well.
0.57 	 So, he was her end...
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.9 	 I first learned of the Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories" books: according to that story, the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along, and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you.
0.98 	 Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the Middle") have done far better than this.
0.99 	 I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws.
0.52 	 The shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his "Matrix obsession" into it.
0.63 	 YOU'LL REGRET IT!
0.86 	 Strange, after 20-odd years in the business.
0.74 	 <br /><br />Epic biopic in name only, Che(2008) barely qualifies as a feature film!
0.87 	 never providing most of Che's story; <br /><br />2.
0.58 	 remaining claustrophobically episodic; <br /><br />6.
0.97 	 The T-shirt franchise has been a success!
0.59 	 <br /><br />Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their screenplay solely on Guevara's memoirs.
0.92 	 Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them, and keep us equally mentally captive?
0.98 	 DelToro's Che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill-disciplined troops.
0.98 	 Thus even the scenes with Fidel Castro (DemiÃ¡n Bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting.
0.57 	 Any selected events are portrayed minimally and Latino-centrically, with Part1's interviews replaced by time-shifting meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and US Government officials promising CIA intervention(!
0.93 	 --cf.The Inspector General(1949)) out to their own local cinemas.
0.71 	 It is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject.
0.51 	 (2/10)
0.91 	 Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies, but you'd think that even the homeless and urban-dwelling Jack Mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide.
0.91 	 A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story.
0.94 	 That Junior can drive Grandpa's car.
0.54 	 Rent CHICKEN RUN instead.<br /><br />*1/2 out of **** I give it.
0.98 	 It's amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video, it should be a crime!
0.51 	 !
0.54 	 The Greta Garbo of my youth.
0.97 	 Every time I see the "ghost of Zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end I can't help but cry my eyes out.
0.91 	 Gone but not forgotten.
0.76 	 SKIP IT!
0.65 	 (unless you are very severe!)
0.72 	 Sid is a stupid Sloth that is left behind by his own family, that can't stand him any longer.Walking in his way, he meets Manfred,or how he calls '' Manny'' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north.
0.62 	 Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp.
0.82 	 What Manfred and Sid does not know, is that Diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber's food.
0.67 	 Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused.
0.59 	 Wow!
0.91 	 <br /><br />This film is dealing with the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without any compromise.
0.66 	 I have found myself crying a number of times during the movie and laughing at others.
0.55 	 By that time however, she is sold again and he is going on a search for her around Cambodia.
0.73 	 The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while.
0.59 	 ***
0.56 	 It looks to me as if the creators of "The Class Of Nuke 'Em High" wanted it to become a "cult" film, but it ends up as any old high school B-movie, only tackier.
0.89 	 The satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters.
0.94 	 From the viewer's side, there a couple of good "director details", some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice.
0.99 	 The special effects are good enough, a good acting/good scenery also.
0.9 	 But the story is way too simple.
0.95 	 It shows how a elite Army bomb squad unit lives, acts and sometimes dies.
0.97 	 It shows the drama of living in war.
0.88 	 One of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to I consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time.
0.76 	 I stayed "conscious", for the entire movie.<br /><br />Honestly speaking, I think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator.
0.94 	 More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on that.<br /><br />A simple thought: if this was a world war II or I movie, only changing time, with everything remained the same, would it be this awarded?
0.91 	 Because there are great ones that elevate the bar way to high.<br /><br />Compared against its rivals in the Oscars, I don't think that all of the prizes it won are correctly awarded.
0.89 	 And watching it again brought a nostalgic lump to the throat.<br /><br />Never mind the bad / hammy acting, the unintentionally amusing fight scenes, plot holes wide enough to pilot a large ocean-going yacht through and the "frightfully, frightfully" RADA accents of the lead players.<br /><br />No - forget all that.
1.0 	 But is that a bad thing?
0.86 	 I for one don't think so.
1.0 	 "Wild Tigers I have Known."
0.92 	 It will only be showing in big cities, to be sure.
0.74 	 I HATE those!
0.66 	 I was waiting for it to make SENSE!
0.99 	 I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could arguably be called "art house" films.
0.87 	 Beth has a key to a warehouse of books?
0.55 	 We learn that Louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence.
0.96 	 Denis is in no hurry to move the action along, and we must patiently build our understanding of Louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son, Sidney (GrÃ©goire Colin, almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache) who rejects him as a "lunatic":, shown as a dedicated father of two.
0.69 	 There are many brief scenes which, while seemingly unrelated, build up an impression of Louis and his milieu.
0.99 	 We are accustomed to brief scenes in Denis's film which are inexplicable: NÃ©nette astride Boni feeding with a spoon; a drive by shooting of Boni's father and then the briefest of images of Boni with a gunshot wound in the head; a scene of Louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of Sidney.
0.6 	 The implication, of the last two, is a rejection, real or imagined, by a father, kills something indefinable in a son.
0.9 	 However, this film isn't really about Shakespeare, and it doesn't matter at all if you dislike Shakespeare.
0.82 	 I am no huge fan of Shakespeare, but marveled at the small portions of the play that Colman re-enacted--though, as I said, this is NOT a really movie about Shakespeare.
0.88 	 The memory of the "The Last Hunt" has stuck with me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13.
0.96 	 She leads a group of burned out cyborgs (That includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch.
0.89 	 The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell, Katt and Galligan are given little to do.
1.0 	 None can act except the nurse who was my fav!
0.93 	 Juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her.
0.99 	 Considering his other great movies (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he's quite a shocker in this one.
0.99 	 It's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every Romeo and Juliet ever made in the history of film.
1.0 	 Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and then the current Leo and Clare!
0.85 	 Especially the killer's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end.
1.0 	 "Movie savvy" characters.
0.98 	 This is a Japanese film but there is quite a bit of English also spoken in here.
0.92 	 It's a pretty film, with nice visuals, featuring the scenic beauty of Hawaii.<br /><br />However, that was the only redeeming quality for me.
0.67 	 Who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the film because her "picture" husband is a lot older than he advertised he was?
0.68 	 By then, for most viewers, it was too little-too late.
0.83 	 I'm not a fan of Monaghan.
1.0 	 His acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me, his only decent performance being in Lost, so I generally try to avoid his films.
0.53 	 This director really knows what she's doing.
1.0 	 Of course, you are going to get the trolls (or just ignorant people) who don't understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it.
0.96 	 But luckily, from what I've seen, they are in the minority when it comes to this gem.<br /><br />Let's not deny that the film was working on no budget, and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work, because that's certainly true.
0.98 	 Pretend for a moment that the budget doesn't matter.
0.99 	 If you take away a bit of the acting, the sound quality (which actually wasn't the fault of the filmmaker; I saw this at a festival and the sound was fine...I guarantee whoever made the DVD itself screwed up), and the fact it was shot on mini-DV, then what are you left with?
1.0 	 Give it more experienced actors, better sound post-production, and 35mm instead of mini-DV and even the trolls couldn't complain.
0.93 	 9/10 stars, this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker.
0.84 	 The story-line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior.
0.99 	 Also, I think something went wrong in the casting.
1.0 	 June Allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and E.J.
0.97 	 And if the FBI service would not be enough, Steward also gives his son's life for the country in WW II.
0.99 	 I totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie.
0.98 	 But it is worth watching if you keep the several understories in mind: How a couple endures media scrutiny, and how the different are treated.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the issue is the credibility of the different.
1.0 	 Australians are different than "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come at it with an air of "oddness" about them.
0.98 	 The couple involved is religious (different than most of culture) and Adventists (different) at that.
0.98 	 So their lifestyle and mindset are suspect to begin with.
0.96 	 Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we're faced with oddness questions.
0.63 	 The real story, then, is how society (and the world) treats the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspect.<br /><br />It's difficult to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!"
0.52 	 But in the years that followed the story and the movie it has been discovered (as you'll find in web searches) that much larger children have been stalked by dingos.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
1.0 	 In more capable hands, Munchies could have been entertaining.<br /><br />After all, it starts out like many great adventure films.
0.68 	 Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru on an archaeological dig.
0.89 	 Simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations.
0.99 	 Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left in charge of Arnold, but as they haven't seen each other in a long time, they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (played also by Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful snack foods company, is eager to buy off Simon's home and land--they're adjacent to his own.
1.0 	 The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town.
0.99 	 Oddly, given the paucity of the production design overall, Cecil's home is quite a gem, imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was an amusing counterpoint.
0.9 	 Too bad, then, that he's out of the film so quickly.<br /><br />At any rate, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes across much better here as Simon than as Cecil.
0.98 	 Further, because Munchies was kept PG, and the violence remains toned down, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they're never very threatening.
0.75 	 It's intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless rip-offs in its wake.
0.96 	 There was potential to make a film that while a spoof, was both funny and frightening, hilarious and disturbing, cheesy and suspenseful, all at the same time, ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988).
0.97 	 The killer still kills for fun.
0.69 	 This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial, (just read the other comments on this film).
0.93 	 Putting aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come.
0.6 	 "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to get in everything "Thief" did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East leading up to it.
0.94 	 If it makes you think about the subject, it has done its job - even if you never believe.
0.75 	 It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the movie.<br /><br />The 20th Anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming up.
0.9 	 contains many surefire laughs and gags.
0.68 	 When they arrive at his home, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges.
0.99 	 With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else!
0.53 	 9 out of 10.
0.98 	 I'm Irish and I've been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission.
0.97 	 The bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom-in, zoom-out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama.
0.82 	 This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like this.
0.98 	 It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next.
0.93 	 A friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week.
0.69 	 The best performance was from Dierdre O'Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman.
1.0 	 I think she should leave her god-awful stand-up and focus more on her acting.<br /><br />All in all, its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the Irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best Irish films ever.<br /><br />I'm expecting a backlash from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great.
0.86 	 But before you reply, ask yourself: Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America?
0.99 	 <br /><br />Like I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play Busted's song 'Thunderbirds are go'.
0.98 	 I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews.
1.0 	 Whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends.
0.99 	 Is the legend true?
0.53 	 Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film?
0.97 	 Does our blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair?
0.95 	 You'll have to watch to find out for yourself.
0.97 	 It's hard for me to criticize anything that Mitzi Kapture does.
1.0 	 That notwithstanding, yes, the plot was predictable.
0.85 	 I think perhaps if Jill HAD slept with Richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was, which would have added more to the suspense.
0.98 	 I was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie.
0.7 	 I do have to say though, I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there.
0.84 	 I've seen all four of the movies in this series.
0.66 	 The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "Love's Abiding Joy."
0.88 	 The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie).
0.52 	 Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book.
0.69 	 I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it.
1.0 	 The books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!
0.71 	 What I expected: A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.<br /><br />What I got: An even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.<br /><br />Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works!
0.7 	 and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the Red Sox ("How did the grass feel?
0.82 	 Kinda spongy?")
0.68 	 at the same time.
0.76 	 Fallon's portrayal "made" the movie.
0.71 	 Hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (i.e.
0.98 	 It's neither a "Guy Flick" nor a "Chick Flick".
0.7 	 Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from?
0.72 	 The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations.
0.83 	 He didn't even rasp well.
0.96 	 Real tough there, Clint!
0.87 	 These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer!
0.62 	 Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol!
0.65 	 Brilliant!<br /><br />Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie.
0.54 	 Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game.
0.96 	 And I mean that very strongly.
0.94 	 I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.<br /><br />Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene.
0.82 	 Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video.
0.77 	 It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.
0.99 	 i couldnt stop laughing!
0.57 	 Well let me say that I have always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest.
0.68 	 Ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it.
0.53 	 Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS?
1.0 	 I've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ("Soldier and Saints" is a recent example).
0.94 	 With hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells' novella -- and at fraction of what was spent by Dreamworks on its "War of the Worlds".
0.98 	 Thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound, but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records.
0.99 	 A guy walks down a country lane, a lot.
0.95 	 Then he walks down the same lane, only shot from the back this time to show he's returning -- clever, eh?
0.51 	 Walking and talking, for nearly an hour that's all that happens.
0.75 	 OK, I'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character's house to the impact site on Horsell Common to show that it's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful (a first-year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this, btw), but half a dozen times?
0.72 	 Back and forth, back and forth, et cetera, et cetera with some yakkity-yak in between.
0.99 	 Remarkable.
0.59 	 Orson Welles made himself a household name doing just that.
0.93 	 Now I for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy.
0.7 	 I believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects.
0.99 	 Some really potent Sci-Fi's have flourished on virtually none at all.
0.94 	 But "The War of the Worlds" as film requires a certain baseline effort.
0.76 	 Wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled.
0.99 	 fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the George Pal/Byron Haskins 1953 version), but they must be handled well.
0.93 	 Fine, we can work around that.
0.95 	 Just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it.
0.58 	 If you must use it, go ahead, but please don't show it twice!
0.82 	 Evidently Hines thinks he's getting a bargain -- More fleeing in terror over there!
0.62 	 Maybe Hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890's.
0.94 	 I wish she had stuck with the "Breathless" look for a while longer.
0.81 	 Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, other than "What about bob?".
0.92 	 The makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part.
0.75 	 Just wish Beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel.
0.6 	 .. and maybe again.
0.94 	 What can i say about this movie?
0.55 	 I have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6.
0.98 	 If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
0.68 	 Pierce Brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role.
0.93 	 I almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots.
0.89 	 Cardone of "The Forsaken" to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back.
0.52 	 This is my warning to you.
0.66 	 More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR.
1.0 	 <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere).
0.84 	 I didn't see the last scene ( cos I was talking with my bro n Mom in law at the same time ).
0.85 	 Anyone can tell me what happened to her?I watched slightly that her husband was hearing someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door,she's dead already.<br /><br />What happened to her?
0.84 	 Did she kill herself?
0.92 	 From reading other reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who shed a tear.
1.0 	 In the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene would have seemed trite and corny.
0.97 	 One would never guess this film was done on a tight, limited budget.
0.84 	 My only "complaint" is that I almost didn't want the film to end.
0.99 	 An unqualified "10."
0.83 	 What's with Indonesian musical movies?
0.98 	 They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.<br /><br />This story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks.
0.9 	 The main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying.
0.5 	 (If only we could say the same about bagpipe music.)
0.88 	 I got most of the jokes (at least I think I did).
0.62 	 Sure, it's derived from Spinal Tap, but there are lots of targets that could stand a Tap treatment.
1.0 	 Generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course Dean Martin songs.
0.63 	 Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between he and Cher and they are the central love story.
0.96 	 He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story.
0.98 	 Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character.
0.6 	 He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.
0.54 	 Therefore I rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies.<br /><br />So I start by saying that I liked this mini serie.
0.92 	 But if they didn't have more money to shoot more story who am I to criticise that??
0.53 	 ?<br /><br />There's only one real problem I have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way.
0.98 	 Noah Taylor did that more in the movie 'Max' which seem to work better I think.
0.85 	 There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user.
1.0 	 It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff.
1.0 	 The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny.
0.95 	 I wish people would look at his life, more then his death.
0.93 	 The only thing good about this film was its soundtrack.
0.99 	 The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing.
0.79 	 Wah.
0.9 	 Damn you Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0.51 	 !
0.93 	 Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana.
0.96 	 Having seen the trailer, and being a thriller-lover, I expected to see first of all a fast moving, breath catching movie, which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil, power and corruption, from a fresh angle.
0.63 	 Save your money, save your time, choose another movie.<br /><br />Robi Chernitsky
0.9 	 Don't listen to the critic reviews.
0.61 	 You wont regret it!
0.88 	 Much to their displeasure (& mine) Garibaldi arrived on station.
0.94 	 Eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk, not that I'm complaining.
1.0 	 At first I didn't like the movie cause of it being a Nazi swastika drama.But after buying it and seeing it, it wasn't that bad.
0.91 	 I heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and Ilse Werner not singing.
0.93 	 This is why Ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture.
0.99 	 When he did Opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking.You see the Nazi soldiers acting normal,like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in France and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs.
0.6 	 We shoot his plane.
0.76 	 They crash.
0.95 	 We end up injuring him.
0.87 	 The catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it.It injured him.
0.86 	 The only problem is that today you have Neo Nazi and Nazi skin heads, who watched the same movies to reflect their Hitler worship and their.
0.95 	 If their scenario looks like they are glorifying it ,then its a Nazi website skip it .Go to IHF or German wartime films dot com, Amazon dot Dee or German video dot net.
0.6 	 They are legitimate.
0.97 	 01/23/10 Mada a mistake it wasn't Herbert's friend that got killed at the church .
0.94 	 Besides being a rip-off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well.
0.79 	 Preminger's adaptation of G. B. Shaw's ''Saint Joan''(screenplay by Graham Greene) received one of the worst critical reactions in it's day.
1.0 	 It was vilified by the pseudo-elite, the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant.
0.97 	 As in ''Peeping Tom'', the reaction was malicious and unjustified.
0.73 	 His film is a Brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions, the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power.
0.94 	 By no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release, it's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience.
0.81 	 I've read all the comments on this film.
1.0 	 I am a great admirer<br /><br />of the Dalai Lama.
0.99 	 It vastly alters<br /><br />the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama.
0.7 	 <br /><br />From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (which demeans<br /><br />the culture of Tibet) to Harra's music box gift, to Harrar's<br /><br />change of heart, everything about this movie is false - except<br /><br />for the amazing photography.
0.8 	 I understand that the shots of the<br /><br />Potala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet.
1.0 	 However,<br /><br />changing a real story about the relationship between two people,<br /><br />one of them very important to this world, in order to build up a<br /><br />movie star is sad
0.51 	 Eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the Nazi's from evading England.
0.92 	 Soon, they realize that she needs a "clique" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.<br /><br />How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me.
0.99 	 Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show, and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on ABC Family.
0.86 	 It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all.
0.94 	 Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun.
0.62 	 The movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line.
0.63 	 I walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can I help?
0.96 	 However, the blame falls on Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes.
0.53 	 Paine had slapped his wife, enraging her father, who did show up at his son-in-law's apartment, but not until Dixon had departed with the body.
0.92 	 With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged.<br /><br />Riddled with guilt, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money for an attorney.
0.65 	 He decides to take on Scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything.
1.0 	 RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the "go-getter" with aplomb.
0.98 	 The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well.
1.0 	 What's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes.
1.0 	 If you enjoyed THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN you'll like this one.
0.98 	 This serial is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature, but for todays audience that's all it is.
0.79 	 I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952.
0.8 	 2 in my book.
0.92 	 It's basically Cody (the lone world's salvation?
0.74 	 If you want to watch a really good serial see Flash Gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women, this has NONE of that.
0.78 	 Nuff said.
0.93 	 give it a 6 if your watching it as a MST3K episode, those guys have some good fun with it; a tweak of the nipples here, a tweak there and I'm flying!
1.0 	 And now as an added bonus, I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song as originally sung by Joel and his two character bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight The Enemy Planet:<br /><br />(Singing at the very beginning credits);<br /><br />(TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR WATCHING COMMANDER CODY....
0.98 	 HE IS THE NEW CHARACTER FROM REPUBLIC,<br /><br />HE GETS IN TROUBLE EVERY WEEK...
0.96 	 SENDS HIM ON HIS WAY,<br /><br />A PUMPKIN HEAD AND A ROCKET PACK.... WILL SAVE THE DAY,<br /><br />(JOEL SINGING) HIS LABRATORY IS A BOXING RING...
0.85 	 WHEN BAD GUYS COME TO MIX IT UP,<br /><br />SOMEBODY ALWAYS GETS KIDNAPPED... AND CODY HAS TO FIX IT UP,<br /><br />HE DRINKS HIS TEA AT AL'S CAFE... AND FLIES ALONG ON WIRES,<br /><br />HE BEATS THE CROOKS AND FLIES WITH HOOKS... AND PUTS OUT FOREST FIRES,<br /><br />(CROW SINGING)<br /><br />BAD GUYS BEWARE... CODY IS THERE,<br /><br />YOU'LL LIKE HIS HAIR IT'S UNDER HIS HELMUT... AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD RHYME,<br /><br />THAT'S THE END OF THE COMMANDER CODY THEME SONG...
0.94 	 SO SIT RIGHT BACK WITH A WILL OF GRANITE,<br /><br />AND WATCH CHAPTER EIGHT, CAUSE THAT'S THE ENEMY PLANET
0.8 	 The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Woman".
0.99 	 I don't know if that was intentional or not, but if sure got some giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown.<br /><br />But those were the only giggles the movie got.
0.84 	 Just re-saw this movie after thirty seven years.
0.91 	 I was eleven years old and caught this flick on South Beach at the long gone Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue.
0.97 	 In 1969, I thought Where it's At!
0.58 	 Now, however, after almost forty years, it's not as good as it was.
0.87 	 Times have changed, and this movie is now a tired old re-hash of the war between the generations.
0.69 	 The acting was decent, the script somewhat out-dated, but the memories were still fresh.
0.76 	 Storm & Co. are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig, Pharaoh's Ra Ha Tet tomb, as possible.<br /><br />At Ra Ha Tet's burial chamber Robert Quentin and his crew of archeologist's together with his Egyptin guide Simira's brother Numar, Alvaro Guillot,already opened his tomb before Capt.
0.83 	 Quentin violated Ra Ha Tet's body by having Dr. Farrady, Guy Prescott, cut his bandages.
0.91 	 This action on Robert's and Dr. Farrady's part has Numar faint dead in his tracks.
0.74 	 This blood-sucking adventure by Numar, with him later losing his right arm, goes on for some time until the by now crazed Quentin trying to find the entrance, you in fact thought that he already found it, to Ra Ha Tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide.<br /><br />We learn at the end of the movie that Numar, to absolutely no one's surprise, is actually Ra Ha Tet reincarnated into another, some 3,000 years later, person or life.
0.99 	 Numar's sister the mysterious and sexy Simira is not only Ra Ha Tet's sister, since him and Numar are really one and the same person, but also the Egyptian Cat Goddess Babesti!
0.96 	 Also not that hard to figure out.<br /><br />With Numar/Ra Ha Tet back in his tomb and all the deaths, due the the Pharaoh's Curse, now at an end Capt.
0.97 	 Storm Sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late Robert Quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to Cairo and modern, this in 1902, civilization.
0.84 	 Tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer.
0.93 	 It does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice.
0.93 	 The kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying.
0.51 	 The party scene (20minutes???)
0.99 	 Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property.
1.0 	 Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular.
0.95 	 Popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this?
1.0 	 )<br /><br />The only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, the voice of Popeye from the early days, continues the role here.<br /><br />Worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts.
0.99 	 "Laughter is a state of mind" says the tag, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's.
0.99 	 When he watched the rushes, did he see a successful, funny fantasy?
0.95 	 Robin Williams and (most especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies.
1.0 	 She was also a scene stealer in the W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, playing Cleopatra Pepperday.<br /><br />Much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been hideously miscast.
0.83 	 Yikes.
0.87 	 Two more would-be disasters.
0.9 	 Left Behind is the kind of "we know what we know cause we know it" movie that Christians (and most any other naive person) needs to help them feel like what they "THINK" and "BELIEVE" (not "KNOW") is right.
0.64 	 I've had about enough (but only after I've had too much) of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi-talented TV actor means something above me.<br /><br />Please, if you love yourself you'll stay away.
0.69 	 The Reason, (which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want that it was made out of my head, I want that I watched ALL OF IT WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head.
0.97 	 My peaceful rage is ending.
0.89 	 The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officer.<br /><br />If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didn't quite get the point.
0.59 	 I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic.
1.0 	 It's an amazing book.
0.99 	 She was a southerner herself, a devout catholic, and a remarkably gifted writer.
1.0 	 In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith, doubt, and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness.
0.98 	 Not only do they exist, they are human beings with families, feelings, and concerns like anyone else.
0.94 	 Flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace'...even in the most violent, distressing, and maddening of circumstances.
0.66 	 Finally, it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view.<br /><br />None of this comes through in John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island'-like adaptation.
0.61 	 The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners.
0.99 	 But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals (like every other place on earth), and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive.
0.92 	 If you're into being offended (which I am not), then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line.<br /><br />I don't like to talk crap about an artist's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know, and I'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker, to which his respected place in film history attests.
1.0 	 My views are clearly skewed by having read (and loved) Flannery O'Connor's work.
0.98 	 Maybe as a stand-alone film it works for cinephiles.
0.95 	 She not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by R.K.O.
0.93 	 But this is part of the movie's charm.
1.0 	 Sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh.
0.98 	 There are people claiming this is another "bad language" ultra violence Mexican movie.
0.98 	 The awful truth hurts, or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal.
0.54 	 Is that what we all are?
1.0 	 I nearly puked when I saw some of the images.
0.96 	 It was not Irak or Rwanda, just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government.
0.99 	 Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people.
0.78 	 The atmospherics are first-rate, with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well-conceived.<br /><br />In the supporting cast, Jean Hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing Pickford to marry him.
0.88 	 Paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made Dave.
0.97 	 he could hardly stand, had to use a cane.
0.83 	 he was staying in a trailer about the size of my bathroom.<br /><br />he didn't know he could do it.
1.0 	 but the movie was bad.
0.99 	 It wasn't funny or cute or much of anything.
0.95 	 Also I did have a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian at the end--hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor--can we let that stereotype go please?
0.53 	 The TV series was much better.
0.98 	 I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like?
1.0 	 Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery.
1.0 	 - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity.
1.0 	 Generally speaking the film is nice to look at.
0.82 	 The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite.
0.99 	 Even Grant can't look elegant in his.
1.0 	 Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!
0.58 	 As such, I'm actually rather fond of it.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Still,the only reason this gets more than one star is that Thomas is great shape, and it's fun to see his tiny, muscular body performing various feats of gymnastic skill on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered about the East European country side (including the infamous "pommel horse" shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers).
0.97 	 If anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again, I'll bet that Thomas kicks the guy in the face.
0.93 	 A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few.
0.98 	 Part of the film is take up with shots of Anne's face while she breaths deeply, and violin music plays in the background.
1.0 	 Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms.
0.96 	 Anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing, which is fine at the beginning, but she stays the same all through the film, and you see no reason for captain Wentworth to fall in love with her.
1.0 	 the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.).
0.93 	 it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie.
0.67 	 i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.
0.94 	 No, the new Star Trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago.
0.98 	 (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons.
0.95 	 OMG, do you think 400 years from now, they would have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard?
0.73 	 If that is the case, where did all the Cylons that populated the original earth come from?
0.75 	 Well, what happened if one of the Cyclon ships at war with the Caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship, loaded with human-looking Cylons, wound up not only jumping through space, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One.
0.94 	 Which came first, the chicken or the road?
0.97 	 This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot!
0.99 	 Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that.
0.71 	 American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more.
0.85 	 !One big BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons!!
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned.
0.99 	 From the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein.
0.94 	 I know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil!
0.7 	 Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired.
0.82 	 This way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive.
1.0 	 Note, though, that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an "LA lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it.
0.54 	 I *loved* the original Scary Movie.
1.0 	 I'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor.
1.0 	 It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor.
0.77 	 I think the Wayans' are a family of comical geniuses.
0.98 	 This was hilarious.
0.96 	 Samotari is too cool.
0.97 	 Way too cool.
0.83 	 It's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together.
0.99 	 That's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague (tiny, really.)
0.98 	 The main characters are between 20 and 30.
0.98 	 The best character is the young Balkan girl.
0.86 	 Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day.
1.0 	 The only great character.
0.81 	 Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own.
0.58 	 If you like alright music, see this film.
0.55 	 There are, clearly, differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter.
0.85 	 The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals.
0.83 	 Oh, brother.
0.65 	 "Coffee grounds!").
0.59 	 His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even the schnoz himself is a bore.
0.99 	 Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie's foul style.
0.99 	 I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a movie script.<br /><br />Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
0.85 	 !The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich.
0.78 	 Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days,For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game!
0.78 	 so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.
0.57 	 I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good-looking horror movie to watch over the New Year's weekend.
0.83 	 Yep, you bet it is.
0.51 	 1/10.
0.64 	 What people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn't a beginning, middle, and end, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long TV series.
0.66 	 So remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn't explored enough.
0.9 	 Seeing characters I had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing, and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while Lian-Chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking.
0.97 	 <br /><br />Then we got a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons (Which had been featured before in the series) while Gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe.
0.86 	 *Shudder* I'm surprised that this particular scene hasn't been mentioned more in the warnings.
0.84 	 Any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that Gwizdo wasn't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl.
1.0 	 I tend to love everything the great late Paul Naschy (R.I.P.)
1.0 	 While not all films starring Naschy are great, they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in Naschy-flicks, and they are always entertaining.
1.0 	 "The Devil's Possessed" (1974) proves.
1.0 	 Naschy stars as the evil Baron Gilles De LancrÃ©, who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power.
1.0 	 When Gaston de Malebranche (Guillermo Bredeston), who fought side by side with Gilles De LancrÃ© against the British, learns about the Baron's evil behavior, he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic Baron's tyranny...<br /><br />Directed by LeÃ³n Klimovsky, who is best known for directing Naschy in "La Noche De Walpurgis" ("The Werewolf Vs.
0.73 	 Naschy often scripted his own films, and one must say that he mostly did a better, more original job than it is the case here.
0.97 	 It often resembles the Sword and Sandal films from the 50s, only that this film is set in medieval times.
0.73 	 The Satanic part was probably only added because the great Paul Naschy's name is linked to the Horror genre.
0.81 	 The film has its good parts: Paul Naschy giving weird speeches, Paul Naschy looking weird, Paul Naschy doing Satanic stuff, Paul Naschy torturing innocent victims, etc.
0.99 	 Overall, "El Mariscal Del Infierno" is only worth a look for my fellow Naschy-enthusiasts.
0.98 	 There are dozens of films starring the Spanish Horror deity which should be seen before this one, such as "El Jorobado De La Morgue" ("The Hunchback of the Morgue", 1973), "La Orgia De Los Muertos" ("The Hanging Woman", 1973), "El Espanto Surge De La Tumba" ("Horror Rises From The Tomb", 1973), "Latidos De Panico" ("Panic Beats", 1983), "Rojo Sangre" (2004), or any of the 'Waldemar Daninsky' werewolf films.
0.51 	 R.I.P.
0.65 	 Paul Naschy.
0.96 	 Or maybe he was simply having fun.....(*1/2)
0.69 	 The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp.
0.76 	 He went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it.
0.97 	 I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left.
0.94 	 "Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many '50s movies about hot-rodding teens encountering the supernatural.
0.96 	 And there's a twist at the end.<br /><br />There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's nice entertainment nonetheless.
0.99 	 My favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot.
0.94 	 Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dumped by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying , neurotic people in the world.
0.98 	 Well, with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in.
0.91 	 Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow.
1.0 	 "We're all out of cornflakes.
0.58 	 Based on a Neil Simon play (who also wrote the screenplay), this has a certain theatre feel to it.
0.98 	 Set and the repartee and looks feel quite play-like (for better or worse).
0.68 	 7/10 <br /><br />http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
0.99 	 There are some great philosophical questions.
0.94 	 What is the purpose of life?
0.79 	 Alas, Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida) is not a gypsy but the daughter of the regiment's recruiting sergeant.
0.7 	 He was dead at 36, seven years after Fanfan, of liver cancer.
0.95 	 It's not those low-cut blouses that do her acting.
0.9 	 She's sharp, passionate, not quite innocent and no one's fool.
0.65 	 Not to mention amusing, acerbic dialogue.
0.93 	 It was just a grim, sad waste of time.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is excellent actor.
1.0 	 Peter Stormare is an excellent actor.
1.0 	 I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep.
0.92 	 Well, first off, if you're checking out Revolt of the Zombies as some very early Night of the Living Dead (1968)-type film, forget it.
0.99 	 Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but he won't talk.
0.93 	 There are big gaps in the plot, including the love story.
0.99 	 Promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time.
0.96 	 But this is the second time I've seen the film, with the first only being about five years ago, and I could barely recall anything about it--so it's not exactly memorable.
0.72 	 Some nice scenery, but the story itself--in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, in the course of doing Egyptologist things in the most un-Egyptologistic of ways (e.g., flash photography in the tombs, the handling of old parchment, etc.
0.8 	 ), uncovers a black market turf war and somehow (in the span of two days, no less!)
0.58 	 Wow, talk about your performative irony!<br /><br />*Note to would-be Egyptologists: take a year or two of Arabic in grad school.
0.79 	 It'll really help out in the long run...
0.94 	 The latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span.
0.97 	 Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot.
0.74 	 I am a 11th grader at my high school.
0.99 	 In my Current World Affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch.
0.92 	 I am firm believer that we went to the moon, being that my father works for NASA.
0.6 	 First of all did he have to show JFK getting shot?
0.97 	 The only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates, which is good b/c in my class we have weekly debates.
0.75 	 I think he and Michael Moore should be working together and make another movie.
0.73 	 This film is being described as a comedy, but it wasn't a comedy at all.
0.84 	 But it was very funny; much lighter than the director's dark and serious The Circle (my favourite Iranian film).
0.87 	 Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film Â it will be a real eye-opener.<br /><br />To me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm.
0.94 	 Australian (and other) film makers could take a leaf out of their book.
0.72 	 Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers.
0.98 	 Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining.
0.98 	 Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round.
1.0 	 The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film.<br /><br />Watch or read it: and then, when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man, reach for Cinderella 2000.
0.98 	 This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period.
0.96 	 Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments.
0.82 	 To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption.
0.99 	 Seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions.
1.0 	 Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released.
0.8 	 <br /><br />Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement.
0.74 	 Most filmmakers felt that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen.
0.71 	 In her DVD commentary, star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film.
0.96 	 In the accompanying "Back Story" documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.<br /><br />The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself.
0.71 	 The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself.
0.99 	 It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner--but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least.
0.98 	 Raquel Welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the entire role is essentially without point.
0.77 	 Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed.
0.62 	 He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he flatly states that Reed "is not a nice person"), and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda'--which, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it.<br /><br />Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people.
0.9 	 The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the "restored" version has been printed to black and white.
0.85 	 The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were.
0.99 	 The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine.
0.99 	 But to end where I began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans.
0.96 	 I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
0.66 	 As far as science fiction backdrops go, Soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre.
0.9 	 For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.<br /><br />Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan.
0.63 	 Just don't expect the next Bladerunner.
0.67 	 Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western.
0.97 	 Nonetheless, this picture was far from great as shortly after this, Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives.<br /><br />Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as Taylor's partner.
0.94 	 <br /><br />Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows.<br /><br />Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged, drinking old-timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well.
1.0 	 In his early scenes, Nolan was really doing an excellent take-off of Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948.
0.87 	 Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film.
0.99 	 The following year Tamblyn and Nolan would join in the phenomenal Peyton Place.<br /><br />The writing in the film is stiff at best.
0.59 	 By the film's end, it's the elements of nature that did Taylor in.
0.91 	 So mostly the Grinch saved Christmas.
1.0 	 This 'poverty row' sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that "Beastmaster" and "Conan" enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along.
0.8 	 It felt as though I'd watched dozens of episodes already, and then it hit me.....There's nothing new here!
0.88 	 I've heard that joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like that on friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline, ect.
0.9 	 Some were good on other shows (not here), and others are new to a profession they should have never entered.
0.99 	 On the back burner for years (so it was reported) this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly - and went straight downhill from there.
1.0 	 Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up on each other's lives.
0.57 	 So, instead, the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another (most having to do with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner.
0.89 	 Or for that matter, among potential audiences.
0.71 	 He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain.
0.59 	 Miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around, and as a result it's the typical Giallo labyrinth, with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes.
0.5 	 It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men.
0.89 	 How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them?
0.5 	 This movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids.
0.6 	 The movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level.
0.93 	 I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
1.0 	 The opening shot was the best thing about this movie, because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate, well-crafted independent film.
0.61 	 Damn that opening shot for filling me hope.
0.97 	 Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office?
0.91 	 Peter Lemongelli as the standard college "nerd" had his moments, especially in a dog collar.
0.99 	 Other than that this "film" went from trying to be a comedy, to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter.
0.53 	 It succeeded on none of these fronts.
0.66 	 Her performance was the only comedy I found.
0.96 	 Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor.<br /><br />Stewart wins first prize for "the gun that won the West", but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen.
0.73 	 WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend.
0.81 	 Well-defined characters?
0.67 	 The only time I laughed was when my boyfriend made fun of the whole she-bang.
0.51 	 P.S.
0.61 	 Andy Dick?
1.0 	 I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books.
0.74 	 The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else.
0.73 	 The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie.
0.52 	 Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family--a common occurrence.
0.99 	 So that criticism is unwarranted.
0.72 	 To say more would spoil the experience.
0.72 	 The film is long, but I did not look at my watch once.
1.0 	 I recently watched Belle Epoque, thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
0.51 	 I was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film.
0.91 	 Maybe the conflict I had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now, the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times.
0.91 	 During the course of the film Della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner Bronson.<br /><br />I found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller.
0.78 	 The unbelievability factor I'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing "Shoot em up" to the screen (a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun).
0.81 	 This film while never attaining the heights of that film, was good in it's own rights.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Commentary with Writer/director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a 25 and a half minute 'Making-of'; a trailer & two TV spots for this film; and trailer for Lower Learning
0.99 	 Officially it's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience.
0.95 	 But of course it is about sexism.
0.98 	 As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing.
0.74 	 Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring Columbo to me.
0.84 	 After a few times, I get bored and changed the channel.
0.84 	 I don't know.
0.98 	 Maybe I just didn't care for this one at all.
0.51 	 Of course, Columbo gets him in the end.
0.64 	 It's just the question of how.
1.0 	 I'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes.
0.75 	 Surprisingly, I was again able to watch her toes in wide screen (like in the beginning of Kill Bill).
0.69 	 I'll give writer/director William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived "thriller."
0.97 	 A few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom, but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer.
0.93 	 Good for late-night, zoned-out viewing only.
0.58 	 Beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies.
0.64 	 Much of the film is a slide show of these images.
0.79 	 They are well produced, of museum size, and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions.
0.99 	 To me, however, they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented.
0.99 	 Manufactured Landscapes, however, offers only strange and bitter hopelessness.
0.79 	 Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the American (and Canadian) Left.
0.96 	 Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie.
0.98 	 Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job.
0.94 	 Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner.
0.99 	 Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fleed to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden.
0.95 	 To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes.
0.98 	 Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist makes it all average, the effects makes the movie a little too much though.
0.66 	 See it and jugde for yourself.<br /><br />
0.66 	 This is a FILM for you.<br /><br />If you want an engaging, entertaining MOVIE - look elsewhere - this is a failure as anything other than an artistic statement.<br /><br />Vikings didn't have horns by the way...
0.77 	 What about Dahmer's childhood?- The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body?
0.59 	 - The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger.
1.0 	 What about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father?
0.96 	 His feelings of neglect when his brother was born?
0.99 	 What about his fascination with insects and animals?
0.9 	 And what about his parent's divorce?
1.0 	 Instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind.<br /><br />Whilst I appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes (or however long), but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with Luis Pinet?
0.56 	 (known as Rodney in this film).
0.95 	 If the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough, but it wasn't.
0.87 	 The scene in which he kills Steven Hicks, his first victim, is a vital part of the Jeffrey Dahmer story because it was the first killing, and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life.
0.73 	 We assume, because his hair style is different, and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback, but to when?
0.96 	 <br /><br />What about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career?-one of the most important clues we have towards understanding Dahmer and his motivations..<br /><br />Some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal, but having studied Jeffrey Dahmer in depth, it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed.
0.99 	 We needed to see his perversion in more depth, to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us.
0.99 	 There is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters.
0.98 	 People seem to have major problems with the transgenered.<br /><br />The title of this movie didn't catch my eye.
0.95 	 It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing.
0.81 	 I did not view these characters as either gender, just human.
0.84 	 It is quite a long scene.
0.97 	 None of the characters are even likeable.
0.63 	 CitizenX(1995) is the developing world's answer to Silence of the Lambs.
0.55 	 the death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey's The Life of David Gayle(2002).<br /><br />Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under which lie limbic brains (lizard-logic).
0.84 	 Why did two kids, who knew better, stone to death a toddler they kidnapped?
0.89 	 Why do bloodthirsty women yell `li-lilililililii' at acts of OBSCENE terrorism?
0.83 	 Chikatilo(Jeffrey DeMunn)'s easy victims were paupers, usually children, who rode the interurban train for fun, since they couldn't afford anything else.<br /><br />CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such `lambs'.
0.72 	 Rostov's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go.<br /><br />The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere.
0.87 	 Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humourless and sullen, at odds with everyone.<br /><br />So it's Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture.
0.77 	 Sutherland's Col.Fetisov, Burakov's boss, and at first his only supporter, is an overly restrained, patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations.
0.86 	 Naturally, he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect, a Communist, in 1984, a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag, supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo.<br /><br />Soon, he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov(John Wood), insisting that the investigation now focus on `known homosexuals'.
0.68 	 The funniest scene of this sad, sad film comes during Bondarchuk's & Gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: one stupid cop earnestly reports, `As I suspected, comrade, it's fornication.
0.99 	 I've made some drawings'--cue howling laughter.<br /><br />5yrs after the bodies began piling up, in 1987, the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles.
0.71 	 Staff, communications, publicity--suddenly all were available.
0.95 	 Serial rapists rape to dominate; serial killers kill to dominate.
0.87 	 So do some soldiers.
0.89 	 Executions merely guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW/WHY they died.
0.71 	 Nor do killers learn regret if they're dead.<br /><br />Vengeance doesn't unkill victims.
0.96 	 Baying for the killer's blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination--once it's too late.<br /><br />Vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn't justice for the deceased--it's appeasement of the living.
1.0 	 3/10, and that's being generous.
0.59 	 The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible!
0.63 	 The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.<br /><br />The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater.
0.68 	 At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show up
oh how I wish.<br /><br />Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today.
1.0 	 Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair.
0.63 	 The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge.
0.59 	 Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming.<br /><br />Inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and belongings, along with Marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook.
0.96 	 They also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying "Oooh yesser!
0.99 	 I don't want no trouble, sir!"
0.83 	 and then is killed instantly.
0.91 	 Marty wont kill us during mid-day!".
0.91 	 Seriously, thats what he said.
0.88 	 Apparently you can only kill at nighttime.
0.74 	 And why are all the bodies disappearing?
0.91 	 The movie is actually very good, filled with clichÃ©s (car wont start, DAMMIT!)
0.51 	 and just plain slasher fun.
1.0 	 she screams "Uh...
0.7 	 tits!"
0.99 	 "Uh... tits.
0.7 	 tits.
0.69 	 Boobs.
0.97 	 Classic 70's sex trash!
0.92 	 Although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes (especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt) also grabbed my attention unmercilessly.
0.98 	 You also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid; I don't know if I've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time.
0.93 	 An unfortunate fact for long time serious fans.
0.51 	 As one, I assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of TOS and retro back from there -- but no.<br /><br />The phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in TOS.
0.66 	 An old style Starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what I expected to see.
0.97 	 I read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie.
0.98 	 I also read somewhere this might be a cult classic.
0.98 	 <br /><br />The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.<br /><br />4/10
0.61 	 Amitabh as always is solid.
0.92 	 Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back.
0.51 	 Pffffft.
1.0 	 I am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence.
0.81 	 The viewer can make the distinction however.
1.0 	 Hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue.
0.78 	 It's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'Zero Day' in retaliation.
0.8 	 Hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power!
0.55 	 Having said that however the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.<br /><br />True, the plot at its most basic is a re-working of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - only without much horror.
0.54 	 Gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax -investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the "house" as the main suspect.
0.62 	 The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard.
0.92 	 It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.<br /><br />Having picked the DVD up for a mere $3.95 last week at my regular video store, I cannot begrudge the expenditure.
0.94 	 $10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film.
0.86 	 Just don't expect fireworks!
0.88 	 His girlfriend, Missy, leaves him shortly before Christmas because she's disgusted that Drew wanted to take her to Fiji for Christmas, which she calls "the family holiday," and the fact that Drew has never introduced her to his family.
0.88 	 I have no idea), who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home.
1.0 	 When he meets the family living in his childhood home, the Valcos, Drew offers them $250,000 to pretend to be his family, so he can relive his fond childhood memories.
0.8 	 Drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely Christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy; I almost wish he had finished with, "Just kidding!
0.63 	 The real reason I don't see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me!"
0.51 	 (2/10)
0.72 	 See it and drop me a line if you can figure out why I like it so much.
0.98 	 For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment.
1.0 	 Watch the great Peckinpah films.
0.94 	 This is apparently one of Shemp's first shorts with the Stooges.
0.67 	 Or watch the real object prompting Moe's exclamation, "Oh...highly polished mahogany!
0.91 	 And the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny.
0.82 	 He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are "regular" people in other shorts.<br /><br />For Shemp aficionados, this is a must have episode.
0.88 	 It won't disappoint.
0.97 	 Everyone in a while, Disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone.
0.91 	 One that keeps you wondering until the very end.
1.0 	 I believe that young kids might enjoy this, as they like it when Good ALWAYS wins.
0.87 	 By the end, when th heroes are left in an "inescapeable" pit, you just KNOW that they can get out.
1.0 	 Everything works out perfect for Cage and his friends, he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is.
0.65 	 See this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to see good acting, or a good film.
0.88 	 Though I like E.E.
0.67 	 )<br /><br />Too bad they only released it on DVD/VCD in a few countries in the worls (mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different).
0.75 	 Worsel rules!
1.0 	 The music and the girls are great, unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them.
0.99 	 But I didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema.
0.88 	 I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie.
0.86 	 I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying.
0.71 	 It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do.
0.97 	 If Ishq Vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will.
0.81 	 To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie.
0.96 	 I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, I write the review to balance unwarranted raves.
0.76 	 Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team.
0.59 	 Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal.
0.91 	 I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty one-note.
1.0 	 The best part of the film, to me, are June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body.
0.86 	 The opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy.
0.84 	 It keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in.
0.73 	 The accents could had used maybe a bit more work, but they seemed to act a lot like I've read the two former-Beatles used to act like.
0.99 	 (as compared to the $220 million others were offering them) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie.
0.52 	 I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it.
0.54 	 My expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since I heard it was being made.
0.79 	 He's no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played him.
0.98 	 He was after all said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story.
0.99 	 Some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep.
0.91 	 He's OK but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie.
0.98 	 His movements are clearly meant to look graceful, like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies.
0.62 	 But it still looks choreographed and artificial.<br /><br />Lois Lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by Kate Bosworth.
1.0 	 Unfortunately, again, for a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and writer, she is about as eloquent as any teenage on Dawson's Creek.<br /><br />James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh.
0.92 	 You see them slowly going being immersed in the water.
1.0 	 As soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms.
0.96 	 Lois is the only one who's not happy to see him back.
1.0 	 Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel.<br /><br />Superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe.
0.57 	 A big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of prison, he now has knowledge about Superman's powers and weaknesses, and yet he's still not able to connect the dots enough to know Luthor would be using kryptonite against him.<br /><br />According to the movie the only thing Superman is good for is lifting really, really heavy things.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.84 	 Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere.
0.98 	 Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces.
0.97 	 The best part of this movie is the scenery
0.55 	 To those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed, I disagree.
0.83 	 You can keep your kung-fu junk.
0.96 	 It didn't have a sneak-peek.
0.99 	 It didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare.
0.82 	 It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera.
0.83 	 In fact, it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind.
0.99 	 Despite improving the look of the plane, the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary.
0.91 	 Instead of one simple explosion, you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times.
1.0 	 Also, in a case of art imitating life, the lead, Mark Frechette, acted out his character in real life.
0.97 	 He died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of "revolution" in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person.
0.65 	 Dang hippies!
0.51 	 !
0.84 	 That is a good thing but also, quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development.
0.67 	 There is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically, there are many similarities.
0.83 	 The thing is, the public knows that something is wrong, for sure!
0.73 	 I watched it 3 times in a row!
1.0 	 The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.
0.97 	 If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of The Eden Formula.
0.95 	 This wondrous film must have cost all of $50 to make.
1.0 	 <br /><br />I loved every minute of it.
0.57 	 The American pilot who gets involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses for the democratically elected Republican Government.
0.53 	 The cruelty of a war (could anybody tell me the difference between Any war and a Civil war ?
0.76 	 It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain.
0.93 	 She has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students.
0.84 	 For one, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit.
0.81 	 Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school, at all.
0.95 	 She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget.<br /><br />Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal.
0.53 	 Since she doesn't cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows.
0.6 	 When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's I was ecstatic!
0.7 	 Simple, The Road Warrior was!
0.73 	 Actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the Road Warrior!
0.79 	 Inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them.
0.86 	 Along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film.
0.99 	 The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.<br /><br />Rats: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior.
0.87 	 And that in and of itself is saying a lot!
1.0 	 By this count 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire.
0.54 	 There were two scenes in the movie (when Dez and Dazzy are driving, and when Dez and Bradbury are driving) where it just went on and on and on...it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action.
0.62 	 First off, the girl who plays Dazzy is just a beast.
0.92 	 Nice.
0.54 	 I must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl's apartment...nice makeup there too.
0.71 	 Nothing!
0.91 	 The newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes, and some of the "mature" stuff I have to shoo kids out of the room for.
0.56 	 But not Talespin.<br /><br />The stories are engaging and very plausible.
0.91 	 Some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie.
0.95 	 You can't tell me what to do!
0.98 	 Baloo is pretty much the way he is in The Jungle Book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness.
0.95 	 Molly is a cute little girl, but you can't let that deceive you.
0.77 	 He doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships.
0.7 	 But something tells me that if he did get the Duck back he'd still do jobs for Rebecca.<br /><br />The Sea Duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed.
0.87 	 The plane's functions don't change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other "super-planes" of other cartoons, it doesn't have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!
0.95 	 It's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun turret, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board.
0.67 	 Period.
0.85 	 Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in-jokes all over the place.
0.98 	 Everything in it rings false.<br /><br />Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top.
1.0 	 The 1930' were a golden age of Los Angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy.
0.99 	 People were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams.
0.94 	 Expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Young Italian-American writer Arturo Bandini arrives to LA on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path, having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology.
0.94 	 Wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though, occasionally, he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive.
1.0 	 He is proud to present himself as an Italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his Italian origin as a burden.
0.74 	 The little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend.
1.0 	 Though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful Mexican woman is much harder to deal with than Arturo is able to realize.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Is it obvious that Arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel?
1.0 	 Is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun?
0.75 	 Is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn?<br /><br />It is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters, performed by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, does not work.
1.0 	 The relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings.
1.0 	 Hayek though livelier a character compared to Farrell's forgot to arm Camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character Frida.
0.99 	 A tougher character of a Phil Marlowe sort would definitely suit Farrell better, though he looks stunning in a period costume, he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty-year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself.
1.0 	 Their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside.
1.0 	 I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers.
1.0 	 Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as "evil genius" and "criminal mastermind" (both not the same in retrospect).
1.0 	 Overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section.
0.61 	 Yet, when the parts finally came together and everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!"
0.93 	 I won't go into the details of the plot of the movie, but I would certainly like to say this Â This film is not just for everyone!
0.58 	 Cusack's done a similar kind of role before in Grosse Pointe Blank, but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb.<br /><br />However the actress who steals all the show is Hilary Duff!
0.88 	 I have always been a huge fan of Ms. Duff.
0.96 	 But to be honest I was a bit disappointed when I heard about the kind of role she's playing in the movie.
1.0 	 All those critics, who shouted hoarse that Hilary cannot act, will be silent for a while.
0.83 	 Still, the first time around, there were enough thrills to make up for it's periodic lulls, resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort.
0.87 	 The sequel has few worthwhile moments, so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent.
1.0 	 Once in a while, it delivers, but most of the time, it just lingers there.<br /><br />As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts.
0.98 	 A wooden Indian comes to life, wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner.
0.99 	 In the end, the second story comes off best, but not by much.
1.0 	 <br /><br />For the most part, the performances are okay at best.
0.98 	 George Kennedy, as the ill-fated general store owner, does an adequate, if not particularly inspired job.
0.95 	 Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guilt-ridden motorist, evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable, redundant material.
0.98 	 Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns in some good, gory work.
1.0 	 I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture Oscar.
0.94 	 First of all, I don't think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role.
0.77 	 She isn't that talented, she isn't a great dancer and she's not good looking at all.
0.77 	 No one better spoil this piece of work!
0.69 	 I wish I could catch a staged version somewhere...maybe someday I will.
0.66 	 Please.
0.9 	 Read a book.
1.0 	 Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
0.94 	 "Power Play" starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast.
0.92 	 The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part.
0.99 	 "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year.
0.8 	 The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad.
0.53 	 Is there such a thing as a "D" class movie?
0.95 	 If so, "Power Play" casts the mold.
1.0 	 Simply not the quality I expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam).
0.94 	 The good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity and your part in the world.<br /><br />However, the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters.
0.91 	 A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose.
0.6 	 Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha) ?
0.64 	 The flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.<br /><br />Overall this movie is a big waist of time, read the book!
0.95 	 You don't expect much from a PRC picture, and with rare exceptions--mainly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few by Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers--that's exactly what you get: not much.
0.56 	 This "epic" about Nazis in Africa trying to incite an Arab revolt against the British isn't much different.
1.0 	 The direction, by longtime PRC no-budget specialist Al Herman, is semi-comatose at best.
0.99 	 Veteran comedian Parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film.
0.91 	 He plays a guy from Brooklyn masquerading as a razor-blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up.
1.0 	 He's got great comic timing, charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time.
0.5 	 Duncan Renaldo is fairly convincing as an Arab sheik--despite his Spanish accent--and veteran bad guy George J. Lewis as Renaldo's Arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy, even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes.
1.0 	 Joan Woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch, and she and Renaldo have great chemistry together, although--like the rest of the cast--she has none at all with King.
0.51 	 H.B.
1.0 	 Warner, whose career stretched back to the silent era, lends a shred of dignity to the low-rent proceedings, even though he blows his lines several times and, PRC being PRC, they weren't cut out.
0.95 	 I had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor/director Albert Brooks and Super Dave Osborne, but had never actually seen him in anything before.
0.99 	 It was worth watching this tenth-rate PRC "extravaganza" just to see him in action.
0.78 	 Was the principal a robot?
1.0 	 It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory.
0.96 	 I cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from.<br /><br />At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky that a film like 'Playing God' did not led her career into a dead-end.
0.83 	 Fortunately for her, 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was launched.<br /><br />There is not too much to be told about this film.
0.7 	 It's the only big screen film of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason.
0.82 	 The majority of the cast are a bunch of no-talent amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics to "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing it on camera.
0.85 	 I've listened to snippets of the commentary,and Mr. Mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash?
0.8 	 I long for the intermittedly appropriate music of Excalibur, and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead.
0.73 	 Our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization".
1.0 	 Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right?
0.9 	 It's not an example of high camp fun, which is way, WAY off the mark.
0.96 	 A glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place.
0.99 	 Bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best, aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies.
1.0 	 Atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Master's degree in film production!
0.55 	 It's an automatic "F", so rest easy!
0.8 	 The main reason to see this film is Warren William, who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager.
0.74 	 He is electric, constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters.
0.98 	 Personally, I found Guy Kibbee not quite right as the lame-brained candidate that William and the others are trying to foist on the public.
0.99 	 He seemed more like an empty canvas than a person.
1.0 	 The story itself is implausible, silly and clichÃ©d.
0.99 	 The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even feasibly good-looking, especially for this role he is given.
0.51 	 0/10.
0.99 	 In fact it isn't over anything.
0.55 	 The fact that U have to find the things mentioned above, actually makes the movie even more funny, because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is, which doesn't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : Spaced Invaders !
1.0 	 But I guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and considering this, this movie has a few highlights.
1.0 	 Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love.
0.95 	 He recalls to the day when the relationship ended.
1.0 	 He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went.
0.85 	 Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him.
0.76 	 He sometimes refers to himself in the third person.
0.54 	 Too make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her.
0.75 	 He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her.
0.75 	 He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he "drops in" on her.
0.9 	 We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value.
0.99 	 I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions...."I heard another Dave & Mary song!"
0.8 	 It isn't even worth watching to make fun of it.
0.98 	 However, after watching some episodes over and over again I've realized that they're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot.
0.98 	 Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it's incredibly cheesy.
0.74 	 It's not like I hate it, but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick.
0.99 	 The scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or whatever) at the movie screen.
0.98 	 If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) had worn a beard, he would have been a match for the model used in those World War I recruiting posters of Uncle Sam Â Wants You!<br /><br />Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure `Americana.'
1.0 	 I admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film I wasn't entirely sure I was going to sit through the whole thing.
1.0 	 Like many other people, I found it pretty boring, and I wasn't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together.
1.0 	 I really think it's sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists.
0.85 	 I can still take it how I want to even if I know what it was meant to do.
0.56 	 I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie.
0.99 	 And given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow-moving nature of the film, it seems to me that director Thomas Riedelsheimer knows that.
0.94 	 His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide.
0.99 	 A year later she's out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG, beautiful condo in Florida.
0.98 	 And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.<br /><br />Logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence?
0.98 	 I hate the character...so much so that anytime she's on for more than 30 seconds I mute the TV just so I don't have to hear her.
0.83 	 There is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes.
0.99 	 Now there's a bad sitcom...
0.87 	 Having seen Versus previously I had high hopes for Alive.
0.98 	 Loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals.
0.97 	 It really needed more shock elements.
0.53 	 The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes.
0.81 	 SPOILER: The young lover, Jed, is kicked out by the spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell), because she wrongly believes that Jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends.
0.93 	 And then they kill Jed, and everybody's sad, until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive, instead of destructive.
0.85 	 This film is roughly what it sounds like: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and (fairly tame) sex scenes!
0.99 	 Some of the music is OK but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
0.99 	 If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you.
0.6 	 It is realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie.
0.9 	 I laughed most of the time when watched it.
0.68 	 But at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end.
0.79 	 Like comedies?
0.87 	 Watch it.
0.65 	 Wanna horror?
0.53 	 Just some low-budget crap.<br /><br />I rate it 3 out of 10
0.51 	 First, as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into.
1.0 	 As for the making of the movie, its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary.
0.98 	 The students can either buy or rent the movie.
0.87 	 I just wish I could get a cleaned-up TV version.
0.97 	 I'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time.
0.6 	 Man oh man...
1.0 	 I've been foolishly procrastinating (not the right term, there's a long list!)
0.81 	 to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so.
0.92 	 You really get the feeling of being inside this "imaginary" nightmarish time warp.
0.99 	 In 1972, after his wife left to go her own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson.
1.0 	 Miss Thompson, a good-humored, long haired, lovely, statuesque beauty queen, is charted to fill a void in Elvis' life.
1.0 	 When Elvis' divorce became final, Linda was already in place as the legendary performer's live-in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976.<br /><br />This is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship.
0.99 	 Linda whole-heartedly tending to her lover's needs and desires.
0.76 	 And even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium.
0.98 	 Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda, but does the job pretty well.
0.99 	 Supporting cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz.
0.85 	 Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror.
0.54 	 The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, go after them with farm implements of SOME kind.
0.83 	 Seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a child-murdering witch that collected children's teeth lived there.
0.95 	 The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get "The Tooth Fairy".
0.76 	 Hardly seems fair.
0.97 	 <br /><br />But really, couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so?
1.0 	 Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts, it just makes it a bit overlong.
0.67 	 The movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it.<br /><br />One of the better MGM musicals, that is not without its flaws though.<br /><br />8/10
0.87 	 She's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town.
0.81 	 Nowadays it's pretty tame.
0.6 	 It only falls apart at the end with a little "moral" ending that the censors demanded.
0.65 	 It comes across as unbelievable and stupid (I saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it--one guy quite rightfully said "No way") I just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different, somewhat tragic and MUCH better ending.
0.98 	 This version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake!
0.69 	 I give this a 9.
0.86 	 First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney's sequel rampage.
1.0 	 It was created around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II," "The Jungle Book II," and "Peter Pan II," all of which were disservices to their original film classics.
0.66 	 (Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II," but I'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.")
1.0 	 Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney "Cinderella."
0.81 	 The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching.
1.0 	 In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving.
0.97 	 The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, "I'm going to do this banquet my way!"
0.83 	 Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, "Ewww!"
1.0 	 I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good!
0.6 	 My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original "Cinderella" when making this sequel?
0.91 	 If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine.
0.82 	 In the first one, Anastasia was evil.
0.98 	 In the second one, she is good.
0.98 	 Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse.
1.0 	 I prefer to visit Germany to meet beautiful single women.
0.96 	 This is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the Rider Haggard story, with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with Russian soldiers seeking a "Stone of Power" buried along with the treasure of King Solomon.
0.74 	 well its official.
0.82 	 they have just killed American Pie.
0.93 	 Most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time, but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot.
0.52 	 There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful.
0.55 	 It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton.
0.64 	 rated R for Language.
0.84 	 This is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be.
0.9 	 And there's Huntley Ritter looking even cuter than he did in "Bring It On" (and acting about as well).
0.9 	 There's always a silver lining, kids.
0.69 	 You just have to look really hard for it.
0.99 	 One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him.
0.71 	 He looked so familiar.
0.67 	 I had plenty of time to think this over.
0.76 	 It was Dean Jagger.
0.98 	 I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas.
0.69 	 This is how I "entertained" myself throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie.
1.0 	 King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie.
0.96 	 Not everything is what it seems.
0.97 	 He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis.
0.89 	 i was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city.. i was younger then.. but it was an Excellent play.. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it.. and why Michael Douglas ???
0.55 	 My evaluation: 8/10<br /><br />I like a lot this movie.
0.95 	 Compare to today brainless movie (just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" ask to something that today doesn't exist anymore: To Think.<br /><br />Well it would not a big surprise a day human eat "cookies" which are create with body of human.
0.89 	 With all what happen on this planet, and to see how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible.<br /><br />Sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again.
0.73 	 Rich at Paradise, other in the hell.
0.85 	 It's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies.
0.51 	 Since writing all stop.<br /><br />If you like reality show this movie is not for you.
0.95 	 If you believe all politician same too.
1.0 	 This one's quite hard to find anymore; I'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day, but don't remember particularly impressed way back when.
0.99 	 But oh, that one sheet...still a gem of my later horror collection.
0.6 	 I am a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tony Shalhoub.
0.89 	 I'm slightly less fond of Stephen King, but I like some of his work.<br /><br />This said, I should have LOVED 1408.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT**** <br /><br />I walked in eager.
0.92 	 Eislin's father shows up once, and there's no seeming connection to the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room.
0.99 	 But other than that, aside from some clever musical cues (the room almost playfully torments Enslin a little bit, and gives him one chance to get out before upping the ante...at which point it gives him the one-hour countdown clock and the titular line from the Carpenters "We've Only Just Begun.")
0.55 	 <br /><br />Having just watched it a few hours ago I am struggling to remember a thing about it.
0.97 	 <br /><br />I will pay u Â£1 to take this film off my hands......oh wait I already gave it away to a "friend".
0.68 	 Editing.
0.67 	 Acting.
0.82 	 Triple Pee's fans (all 8 of them) proudly declare how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors".
0.87 	 Or are they Martians?
0.76 	 Audio.
0.96 	 The synchronization.
0.61 	 The stories and characters are not amusing (if at all) on an intelligent level, but on the basest level.
0.83 	 This also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning, etc.
0.93 	 Finito.
1.0 	 It's easy and fun.
0.79 	 <br /><br />As for the Church-bashing...
0.98 	 Some viewers get all excited about his attack on Catholicism and what-not.
0.56 	 Where does he get the nerve?
0.71 	 E-mail me.
0.72 	 The original was a high impact, dark thriller that achieved "cult" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven.
0.86 	 Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of Catherine Tramell... or is it Sharon Stone.
0.72 	 Possibly a copulation of both.<br /><br />If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in "B.S.1", forget it.
0.51 	 You wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them.
1.0 	 It's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies, via the 1966 GEORGY GIRL, when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old.
1.0 	 A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.<br /><br />If you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system.
0.65 	 However, the end is somewhat of a surprise.
1.0 	 On the top of it all comes the "message" of the show, that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most ostensible manner.
0.64 	 Well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you.
0.69 	 If you think I'm overgeneralizing, go watch this film, and see what you make of the "white boys".
0.84 	 There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now.
0.67 	 <br /><br />Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time.
0.8 	 For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson.
0.96 	 It didn't disappoint.
0.87 	 EVERYONE was caught up.
0.61 	 I was an MTV junkie at the time(they actually played music then....all the time)Prince played at least once or twice an hour.
0.92 	 One of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big then.
0.96 	 It was mainstream and it seems like a clichÃ©' now.
1.0 	 It got so popular that it became ridiculous.
0.79 	 It's like the rappin' Granny commercial for Wendy's Hamburgers.
1.0 	 <br /><br />It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was caught up in it (sadly, kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something.
0.72 	 He is melting because he is melting.
0.8 	 The former prizefighter, who once faced Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life.<br /><br />The plot is gracefully simple: In 1922 Dublin, a starving and humiliated man who's been thrown out of the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood, himself becomes an informant.
1.0 	 Before I begin, I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including Whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination.
1.0 	 It is highly entertaining, and .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
1.0 	 taken in the right context as a work of FICTION, it is a very good movie.
0.5 	 I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is a complete invention of fiction.
0.72 	 But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money.
0.84 	 The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself, or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.<br /><br />But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much.
0.64 	 The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie.
0.99 	 Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin, Idi's second wife, whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity.
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.95 	 they just MAKE UP these things?
0.68 	 Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence, that's why!
0.65 	 They don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves.
0.98 	 Look, that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we don't need this Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that!
0.57 	 (Ironically, even the titular character is portrayed by an American black actor!)
0.78 	 Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!?
0.69 	 Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves?
0.63 	 I urge all who continue to watch Hollywood's purportedly "true" movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself, and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!
0.78 	 Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing (but then, I guess my expectations were sky-high).
0.92 	 Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime.
0.74 	 Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film.
0.58 	 A shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts.
0.52 	 ****MINOR SPOILERS*** As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet "Hobgoblins" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way.
0.92 	 I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer.
0.99 	 Obviously we were wrong.
0.77 	 But we both chose that love anyway.<br /><br />And no, it never changed our sexual orientation.
0.97 	 That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos.<br /><br />When we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex.
0.91 	 As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.<br /><br />This story is not far fetched.
0.97 	 However, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me.
0.71 	 My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years.
0.62 	 I still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times.
0.89 	 I never have much cared for animals talking, or at least UN-animated ones but this one I'll stand up for.
1.0 	 To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.
1.0 	 Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive.
0.95 	 In a second, smaller room, there were no seats, just large pillows.
0.56 	 As the camera slowly zooms in on "Sam", we would wait for that "OH!"
0.5 	 Occasionally, something enjoyable would happen, but then things would slow down again.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Goes to show, I guess, where followups (in this case, to the great classic, "Umbrellas") often do go awry.
0.52 	 One cannot recapture, only recreate.
0.99 	 There are not much movies I like, but I do like this one.
1.0 	 The bad boy is pretty too.
0.99 	 I guess wrong.
0.73 	 Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other.
0.62 	 We haven't seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like.
0.99 	 Always sounds great on paper when you're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethoven's symphonies.
0.64 	 Great ideas like all vampires are female.
0.93 	 Ergo hot, seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way.
0.69 	 So it all looks good up to actually making it.
0.71 	 Another fight.
0.89 	 Eureka we've found how to win.
0.92 	 Big fight again and the End.
0.99 	 If it was made an indie company it would be great.
0.91 	 It all could have been gore soaked beautiful.
1.0 	 The story is pretty well written, and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films.
0.68 	 The fights seem pretty real.
0.6 	 But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire, grenades, morter rounds, and bazookas.
0.7 	 Those bazookas need serious site calibration.
0.95 	 Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't.
0.98 	 I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film.
1.0 	 If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.<br /><br />Carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot.
0.78 	 God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better.
0.59 	 I am an avid fan of violent exploitation cinema, who would never attack a film for being violent or disturbing.
1.0 	 I consider "Cannibal Holocaust" a masterpiece and will always defend controversial films like "Day Of The Woman" or "Last House on the Left" as genuine classics.
0.98 	 Anyone who browses through my other user comments will notice that I am actually very pro-violence/gore when it comes to films.
0.89 	 Due to its status as one of the most controversial films around, however, I decided I had to see it.
0.51 	 Simply the disbelief that a film that shows NOTHING except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cult-following.
0.78 	 It IS disturbing, I give it that.
0.77 	 What is more disturbing, however, is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece.
1.0 	 The girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor, and reacts very calm to all the torture.
0.57 	 That makes the film look less realistic, which is, in this single case, a good thing.
0.82 	 However, I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this, other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture.
0.51 	 I was told that it was a sort of "Japanese version of the Matrix".
0.93 	 Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist.
0.99 	 She has also said on her radio show she hates making "romantic comedies" because she doesn't believe in them.
0.77 	 I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here.
0.74 	 This film is a trifle at best.
0.97 	 She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, unbelievable "romantic comedy" that has no basis in the real world.
0.82 	 Whereas there will be some who will say "suspend your disbelief", one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood.
0.87 	 As many have said here and on other comment threads, Janeane is not ugly, but in fact, quite beautiful.
0.81 	 Having said that though, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely stay with Uma, not Janeane.
0.98 	 Her natural beauty comes through anyway.<br /><br />I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character, and actually scoring with Janeane.
0.98 	 Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower gentlemen.
0.98 	 This is the role that Janeane is best known for, and that's a shame, as this really isn't that good of a film.
0.98 	 There's one line that makes it worth to rent for Angel fans.
0.52 	 You are glad when they are killed off.
0.92 	 Long live the strong female character in a horror movie!
0.51 	 !
0.65 	 In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur.
0.87 	 The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy.
0.99 	 Lots of slapstick: Buster falling on a bulkhead door, falling in a puddle, running around pants-less.
0.97 	 Cheap prices, like $1.95 for ladies hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to Buster.
0.78 	 Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster/Mulligan.
0.99 	 Buster was trying to go backwards!
0.79 	 So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet.<br /><br />This Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message.
0.61 	 A killer terrorizing young people, a white mask...you get my drift.
0.53 	 The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's about it.
0.82 	 I do give credit for it being shot on a VERY low budget--I always support movies like that.
0.66 	 I went into this movie with high hopes.
0.97 	 Normally, I'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch, or so I thought.
0.87 	 I'll list the good parts of this movie: -The creature effects.
1.0 	 All of the creatures were well-done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well.
0.92 	 The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese.
0.59 	 -The dialogue: This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichÃ©d thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can.
0.96 	 Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation.
0.78 	 It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest.
0.84 	 To sum up: Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money.
0.89 	 Wait til the next big monster movie comes out.
0.94 	 I suppose the production values are OK, decent photography, unobtrusive direction and all that.
0.96 	 I've never cared much for him, and this movie validates that perception.
0.78 	 It's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his "Star Wars" films.
0.89 	 On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts utterly stole the show.
1.0 	 She showed charm, beauty, and acting chops all in one performance.
1.0 	 I remember seeing her in "Texasville" recently and taking note of her beauty.
0.97 	 It's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier.
0.95 	 I am a lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven.
0.98 	 These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world.
0.51 	 In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes.
0.71 	 You met someone the first time, you fell in love completely, but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony.
0.77 	 Who hasn't go through this?
0.8 	 After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer.
0.93 	 The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series.
0.57 	 and it doesn't help rohmer's case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner).<br /><br />maybe this movie didn't look so paltry when it came out, without the syberberg film to compare it to, which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources.
1.0 	 all I know is, the German version is pure magic, while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes.<br /><br />the music... la musique... isn't even credited here on IMDb... but someone based it on 'airs from the 12th-14th centuries" or something... well it isn't a great help to the film.
1.0 	 syberberg's Parsifal was adorable, and can be seen on German television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented.
0.91 	 BON MARCHE!!
0.87 	 This film deals with two ex-football players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey, (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds.
0.96 	 Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works at having sex talk over the telephone.
0.95 	 Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl.
0.78 	 golf courses or hang out in a Sports Bar where all kinds of city things go on.
0.97 	 There is lots of punches, killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big ZERO.
0.99 	 This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD.<br /><br />Television moved out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers.
0.59 	 <br /><br />(Possible spoiler warning) <br /><br />The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic "caveman meets fluffball" yarn, where a "charming" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs.
0.74 	 <br /><br />I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it.
0.99 	 <br /><br />In one sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job.
1.0 	 Both features show to what amazing extent Willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country).
0.96 	 Impressive!
0.97 	 Is it safe?
0.97 	 Is it safe?
0.97 	 Is it safe?
0.84 	 Well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience.
0.54 	 Cameos include Liza Minneli ("a frog?
0.87 	 "), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (propositioned by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers.
0.78 	 The problem is the role of the characters in the film.
0.94 	 I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin."
0.59 	 She's the girl you love to hate... but in this story, I just didn't care either way.
0.99 	 He combines the worst from both his professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy.
0.54 	 Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b*lls***osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love.
0.98 	 Example: there are three main Marx brothers hence what a "great" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the super-ego.
0.59 	 Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours?
0.53 	 The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about "hidden, deep meanings".
0.64 	 the easily impressionable and the gullible.<br /><br />Zizek utters a number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with "the satisfaction of work, of a job well done".
0.56 	 Don't laugh...
0.84 	 Talk about putting words into one's (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to "say".<br /><br />I like Zizek's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky's terrific "Solaris", but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory.<br /><br />Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone.
0.72 	 "I just want to play with it all day!"
0.76 	 Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal "2001"s.<br /><br />The fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility.
0.79 	 After all, sociology functions in precisely the same way: it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it's what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener.<br /><br />I was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit...<br /><br />Slavoj Zizek: soon as a stalker in a kid's park near you.<br /><br />http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
0.84 	 I collect Horror films from all over and I have seen the good and the very bad - Zombie Bloodbath is a low budget video.
0.99 	 Sure, the acting is bad, the storyline is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low in some spots.
0.98 	 I will buy it and judge for myself.<br /><br />Story is basically a Nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies.
0.93 	 One guy gets attacked and ripped from the lower area all the way up, if you know what I mean.
0.97 	 Then his guts are shoved out of his mouth.
0.99 	 There are a million gore gags and it's almost ALL action.
0.79 	 I say stop being a prude, enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat market.
0.69 	 I liked it before, but now I can see what Todd Sheets was actually trying to do with this one.
0.55 	 And the commentary helps too, hearing Sheets talk about the film in detail, He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to all people involved.
1.0 	 I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't.
0.65 	 That is the only thing I can positive to say about this movie.
0.94 	 Cleveland is the star, I've been there and never saw the city look this good.
1.0 	 I have no idea what people are complaining about.
0.99 	 I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie.

1.0 	 If you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead.
0.52 	 A couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from Kathy Shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble.
0.79 	 There is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.59 	 Two hours in and I was totally past caring.
1.0 	 Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige.
0.85 	 Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen.
0.98 	 "Khanabadosh" can be very easily understood by an English Music Sponsor.
0.99 	 But instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains, they choose to make a trip by car.
1.0 	 Without wanting to be prejudiced, she can only conclude that Early Grayce and Adele Corners are poor white trailer park trash.
0.96 	 She definitely doesn't want them in her car, but Brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway.
0.99 	 She plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her Early and does that really very well.
0.96 	 I still wonder why I watched this movie.
0.93 	 Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles.
0.96 	 I didn't even know all their names!
0.88 	 Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much.
0.88 	 The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up.
0.8 	 Recap: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy, knowledge that might unbalance the world.
0.87 	 He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union.

0.53 	 Some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore.
0.99 	 And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode.

0.97 	 Enjoy it, and then forget it.<br /><br />4/10
0.89 	 Having read some good reviews about this film I thought it was about time I go and see it.
0.99 	 Basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence.
0.99 	 Firstly, why did said Knights move the treasure from Europe to America?
0.95 	 How did Nic Cages character figure out that 'Charlotte' was in fact a ship?
0.99 	 And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world?
1.0 	 Cage has been in some great action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why has he lowered himself to this?
0.52 	 Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good.
0.91 	 There parents also seemed engaged.
0.69 	 Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids.
0.67 	 If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how could you possibly make a connection to Ask The Dust (the novel)?
0.87 	 -And if you wanted to make this story into a film, then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek?
1.0 	 But you hope for the best.
0.89 	 I really hoped a lot during this film.
0.94 	 I actually wanted it to be good.
0.6 	 I've seen it.
0.69 	 Alright.
0.63 	 I had to see it, because I like the book so much and was curious.
0.97 	 And I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />1/10 is for Colin's sweet little mustache in the end of the film.
0.65 	 So sweet... Had he worn it the whole time through, I'd given it 2/10.
1.0 	 His moment is brief; his promise is immense.
1.0 	 From what critics and audiences indicated, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker.
0.97 	 Sure, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked.
1.0 	 Overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz.
0.97 	 I downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the Quality was kinda good!
0.99 	 Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was average.Prashant Raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is .
0.91 	 At least there is honor among crocodiles.
0.5 	 Other than that, it's as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been in.
1.0 	 This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making.
0.95 	 In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush.
0.89 	 This scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches.
0.91 	 If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and done it better.
0.55 	 Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) don't help in supporting roles.
0.93 	 "You're wrong Mr. Dunston".
0.61 	 The loner can do neither and suffers for it.<br /><br />The caption above plays on Tatum's assertion that he can't live without his coffee.
0.68 	 This picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population.
0.91 	 And this isn't the first time she's done that!
0.7 	 It almost seems as though there was a "Bradford" film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases.
0.81 	 When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "Ah, it's probably about my alimony.
0.84 	 I've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it," it's more of a rib to Powell rather than a serious statement.
0.56 	 The dialogues are much better than those in the "Umrao Jaan Ada" - a supposedly dialogue based movie.
0.99 	 Same here, in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting.
0.98 	 However, though I respect Ravindra Jain for his body of work from movies to Ramayana, I missed Ram Laxman badly.<br /><br />It had no double entendres(Sivan category), no bikinis, no intrigue, and no nonsense.
0.57 	 The movie is only about Prem & Poonam, rest of the characters are incidental.
0.55 	 The situation of tragedy was artificially created.
0.81 	 But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came.
0.98 	 The preaching by Mohnish Bahal and later by Alok Nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard.
0.99 	 But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was.<br /><br />There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended?
0.96 	 2 Has the movie ended?
0.83 	 Why?
0.95 	 So, why isn't this movie out on DVD?
0.86 	 This self proclaimed "very talented artist" have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century.
0.99 	 Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor... it repeats the same situation over and over again.
0.77 	 I just got this video used and I was watching it last night.
0.74 	 The acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards.
0.89 	 The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like Twister.
0.81 	 Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what all he had to do, which wasn't much.
1.0 	 The person that stood out the most to me in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife.
1.0 	 There's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me.
0.75 	 She played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her.<br /><br />"Diary Of A Sex Addict" while not Oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of.
0.78 	 Nuff said.
0.84 	 Want to see a good musical?
0.96 	 THEN DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.
0.6 	 Ever since I saw that segment I have been searching for it and have been wondering if it is somewhere available.
0.82 	 (other segments in that serious were about the Baker Ejection Seat; an instrument to find avalanche victims etc.
0.51 	 The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup.
0.84 	 While I like Steve Martin, he seemed like he was trying to hard.
0.51 	 The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone.
0.99 	 This film had a great cast going for it: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres -- solid b-movie actors all.
0.99 	 First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need.
0.98 	 I must say that I had wanted to see this film for a long time, and I was not disappointed.
0.86 	 I have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary.
0.84 	 Maybe not small children as they may get scared.
0.95 	 <br /><br />F.
1.0 	 The premise is good, the cast is great (I was especially pumped to witness the return of David Naughton) and, God love 'em, you can tell everyone tried their best.
0.94 	 "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can do Christopher Guest movies and, despite the fact he makes it look easy, you should probably just forget trying to do the same.
1.0 	 Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this and they should be seen more often...they are the reason this gets 4 stars from me.
0.87 	 I disliked Frosty returns and this one.
1.0 	 Frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming Drama.
0.99 	 I agree to her just like the 3rd one Frosty returns.
0.89 	 Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience.<br /><br />I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as one without much dialog, shorts, foreign films.
0.94 	 It also could have gone in different directions, still with a shorter running time, and been far more effective.<br /><br />As it currently exists, this is not something that one can readily recommend or one I would have any desire to watch again.
0.64 	 Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long.
0.98 	 When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky, and I'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong.
0.69 	 While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.<br /><br />If you read the last review (it was hard, since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie), you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done.
1.0 	 Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines into that same review, you discovered the poster's reason for disdain: he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack...apparently).<br /><br />So, despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director.
0.83 	 Absolutely.
0.74 	 Oh Yes.
0.6 	 Certainly.
0.94 	 Now, unlike the other poster to which I referred, I actually know something about direction.
0.87 	 Of course I really don't think that makes a lick of difference (the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction), but I thought I should simply establish once again that I'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL).<br /><br />Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of "tension and release" rather than the messy, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today.
0.6 	 Lighting, cinematography, and editing?
0.98 	 I've already wrote so much, and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I'll just wrap it up.<br /><br />In short, go see this movie.
1.0 	 Don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post.
0.58 	 Songs are OK too.
0.85 	 I will avoid naming the murderer but I think it's necessarily obvious because of the plot "thriller" demands.<br /><br />A very well-done but dated film noire (for example: everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters.
0.99 	 And no dead bodies were ever shown, unlike today's gore fests.)
0.89 	 This happened in 1952, I was seven, the movie 13.<br /><br />We were so young...
0.79 	 It was lived by the spectator I was.
0.73 	 That day I loose Gunga-Din for ever.
0.65 	 I left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit I didn't expect to do this morning when getting up.
0.53 	 Uggh!
1.0 	 It does get a 7 for very high production values, but as for entertainment values, it is rather poor.
0.96 	 In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s.
0.7 	 It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing.
1.0 	 As a result, with overblown production numbers and a weak story, this film is like a steady diet of meringue--it just doesn't satisfy in the long run.
1.0 	 And, to make matters worse, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" weren't even nominated in this category!
0.62 	 It's not a big film.
0.6 	 yet it has a big - REALLY BIG plus on the story.
0.97 	 The girl we didn't ask to a date, the test we've failed, the friend we let down, are all in our history.
0.81 	 The first time I watched it, I was 15.
0.73 	 What's in a name?
0.72 	 I think so.
0.58 	 Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server.
0.99 	 Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly.
1.0 	 Beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, masterful camera work and flawless texturing.
0.87 	 And then the two main characters moved.... and spoke... And the movie died for me.
0.5 	 Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail?If so, this is your movie.
0.98 	 This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd.
0.99 	 (This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint).
0.98 	 Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city, mind you, Ive been there- and testifies against the girls, as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison.
0.92 	 Rent Another Day in Paradise instead.
0.88 	 Tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this "executive" reign!
0.84 	 -****1/2 stars.
0.56 	 <br /><br />The movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go.
0.98 	 You can't look away nor can you stop listening to them.
0.83 	 I watched it recently (at a sleepover, funnily enough) and I liked it more than I had done since I was under 6 or something.
0.86 	 I have never seen such a movie before.
0.59 	 I was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie.
1.0 	 I never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny.
0.97 	 The story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them.
0.99 	 I have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it I think its worth watching.
1.0 	 I give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created, this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash.
0.99 	 I mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like "the camera is in front of them".
1.0 	 You will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is, me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie, the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh!# although he doesn't speak English lol.
1.0 	 This movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie DEFINES lame.
0.99 	 The evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous, the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time.
0.92 	 The evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want.
0.97 	 So many plot holes from scene to scene.
0.98 	 I was laughing like crazy when they decided to "Escape To Mexico" to get away from the serpent.
0.69 	 I guess hopping the border solves all problems.
0.72 	 Another scene that completely stupified me.. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other... the scene was so clichÃ©d and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they JUST MET even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing.
0.73 	 Bad Hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this.
0.57 	 No, it's not the horror movie...This one is actually a love story.<br /><br />The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them.
1.0 	 She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack.
1.0 	 She loves him until the champion comes along, that is.
0.99 	 Even though she marries One Round, she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between One Round and the champion.
0.99 	 She comes back to One Round's corner, just when things look their bleakest, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back.<br /><br />This film was very early in Hitch's career, but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film.
1.0 	 While looking through all of these old films, it is amazing how I think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off.
0.51 	 Maybe I should be the one....<br /><br />Skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of Hitchcock's films.
0.99 	 Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie are all great cinematic works, and all of them contain heavy alcohol use and nudity.<br /><br />"It's not how much, it's how you use it"
0.71 	 This sitcom had a feel of 'Citizen Smith' about it.
1.0 	 Ray was very much like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society, but failing miserably.
0.91 	 Sadly, the sitcom got a negative reaction from viewers (I can't think why).
0.78 	 The movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers.
0.78 	 My, what we've done to the planet you might think.
1.0 	 I hope we get to see other things like this.<br /><br />That's very rare.
0.77 	 It'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't.
0.58 	 So, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera.
0.66 	 Most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two Demons films.
0.78 	 The problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the Demons series.
0.74 	 It starts out with a creep intro, and stays pretty creep throughout.
0.99 	 There's no gore and the film movies slowly, but I still dug it.
0.64 	 Italian fans should try it out.
1.0 	 Who in the world told Harrison Ford that this was a good role for him??
0.51 	 !
0.96 	 I watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it.
1.0 	 <br /><br />A much, much better film than the same director's De battre mon coeur s'est arretÃ©, which was boring and unbelievable.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from conventionally beautiful, but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it.
0.62 	 I wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is.
1.0 	 I've seen a bit of Gilles' Wife and a bit of The Moustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and I've seen all of De battre mon coeur s'est arretÃ©, and that certainly is rubbish.
0.77 	 She seems to have a few coming up, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.
0.61 	 I give it a 10 out of 10.
0.97 	 Absolutely awful-looking dinosaurs, which is the only reason you'd probably want to sit through this anyway.<br /><br />The one redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl.
0.96 	 Notorious for more than a quarter century (and often banned), it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems.
0.92 	 Hey, it's often better to be talked about, rather than actually seen when you can't back the "legend" up with substance.<br /><br />The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently, and is available on home video, so that veil is slowly being lifted.
1.0 	 While there is still plenty to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them, than arouse much real passion.
0.85 	 Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can more easily see the film, the notoriety of something once 'forbidden' has been lifted.
0.75 	 And this beast has been tamed.
0.96 	 I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time.
0.81 	 <br /><br />Good luck, won't you?
0.95 	 There are no fancy sets, explosion or glamorous people--only fine writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, take note!
0.53 	 ... but the trouble of this production is that it's very far from a good musical.<br /><br />Granted, one can't always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty.
0.97 	 As the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up, they're instructed to break into the old execution room.
1.0 	 OJ Simpson is a detective, coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona.
0.97 	 Best/Worst Moment: In one jarring scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue.
1.0 	 Now THAT'S a Guilty Pleasure.
0.55 	 People call this a comedy, but when I just watched it, I laughed<br /><br />only once.
0.93 	 I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14,<br /><br />and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be<br /><br />taken seriously.
0.64 	 I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central.
0.65 	 Proof that you a can start anywhere.
0.65 	 More like Joshua Jackson.
0.96 	 She was a tease who liked playing with him.
0.81 	 The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting.
0.55 	 Interesting.
0.86 	 Gabriele is simply an Anti-Fascist.
0.97 	 I don't want to spoil anymore about the plot: go looking for this film!
0.98 	 It's one thing to watch "Mufasa" fall from a cliff in to a stampede or Bambi's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods.
0.93 	 How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here.
0.88 	 Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs.
1.0 	 If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life", by Peter Capaldi.
0.96 	 As for myself, I was expecting a low-budgeted cheeseball zombie flick- and that's exactly what I got.
0.98 	 I wasn't disappointed at all.
0.91 	 The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all of the zombies had JUST been turned, so they are freshly-undead zombies.
1.0 	 Obviously they did that because it would've been pretty costly if they had done full-on rotted zombie FX.
1.0 	 I understood the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie.
0.89 	 Of course not!
1.0 	 So why there are some morons on IMDb whining like school girls about this movie, I'll never understand.
0.99 	 Oh and YES, there ARE worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst you've ever seen, 'cause you know you're full of it!
0.63 	 Or "Feardotcom"?????
0.98 	 THOSE are some of the worst I've ever seen.
0.99 	 If you can't see that it's just a low- budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something's wrong with you.
0.95 	 There is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene.
1.0 	 The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of India's most loved movie of all time, 'Sholay'.
1.0 	 Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the Old West.
1.0 	 Basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him.
1.0 	 However when he escapes his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for Little Creek's female horse.
0.65 	 In the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, Little Creek lets Spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses.
0.83 	 Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt.
1.0 	 Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy/Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe.
1.0 	 It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for Bryan Adams' "Here I Am".
0.58 	 <br /><br />The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them.
0.61 	 They seem so real.
0.89 	 Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them.
0.99 	 Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating.
0.69 	 These seem like decent, simple folk.
0.98 	 If you're a fan of the late Gram Parsons then this movie is definitely going to divide you!
0.87 	 Altogether though, what probably disturbs me the most about this movie is that the real Phil Kaufman was actually on set to help assist with the facts of the story.
0.95 	 But, if you're like me and are a fan of the late Gram Parsons, enjoy films that attempt to tell the truth as much as they can especially if they're based on an actual real-life story, and or you just like good films, be-them road movies, or fictional slice-of-life stuff, you will truly loathe this film and advise others to do likewise.
0.61 	 I obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been made in the first place, but since it was made I would have preferred it to have turned out differently than what it did, unfortunately!
1.0 	 Maybe some day the real facts of the story will come through and be made into a really great biopic on all of Gram Parsons life...not just what happened to his body after his spirit left it.
1.0 	 It should also be noted that they did actually use Parsons music, and a few others as well in the flick, but not surprisingly though, you never get to hear enough of it to really enjoy it even in the slightest bit.
0.98 	 (Turkey-Zero Stars)
0.81 	 Perhaps there could be a follow up series called "The century at war" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors.
0.87 	 I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop.
0.98 	 Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing.
1.0 	 William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story.
0.98 	 Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone.
0.93 	 'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins.
1.0 	 Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia.
0.91 	 The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack.
1.0 	 With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era.
1.0 	 Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release.
1.0 	 However shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable.
1.0 	 If it's using the original words in an updated setting, that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles, eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively.
0.91 	 Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show.
0.67 	 <br /><br />Another problem is Branagh himself.
1.0 	 I agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important, he's such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time.
0.96 	 Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King, thus an unimposing so-called King with no Kingly attributes.
1.0 	 Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production.<br /><br />Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.
0.97 	 In this film, there are questions of what an accident really is Â such as whether Albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying Catherine away from stiff-upper-lip, loveless James (Stephen Fry Â who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts.
0.93 	 's innocent (and disturbingly, exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower-era land of make-believe.
0.98 	 Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7).
1.0 	 The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast.
0.95 	 My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one.
0.65 	 I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything.
0.98 	 But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.
0.56 	 The story marks Prashant making efforts to save his little sister (who is perpetually in a trance) from a hostile hippie environment.
0.98 	 666: The Child starts as a plane crashes, the only survivor of flight 666 was a young boy named Donald (Boo Boo Stewart) who is adopted by news reporter Erika (Sarah Lieving) & her cameraman husband Scott Lawson (Adam Vincent) after they covered the incident for Channel 6 news.
0.99 	 It's hardly a great starting point to bring about the destruction of thew world is it?
0.51 	 Every character in 666: The Child is some form of the main character's from The Omen, the adopted parents, the Priest who tries to warn them & the sinister babysitter.
1.0 	 I expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue.
0.51 	 Shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it.
0.85 	 It's just a movie with a vampire in it.
0.91 	 It's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at Blockbuster.
0.98 	 It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller.
0.88 	 This is one of those.
0.81 	 I went because I was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the Koreans.
0.94 	 There are some holes in the story but didn't really matter.
0.88 	 I sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when I see summer blockbusters.
0.99 	 It occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films.
0.76 	 If they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace".
0.89 	 But then, there you have it, a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say, "HOKIE AS HELL."
0.7 	 Ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning.
0.77 	 I'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end.
0.92 	 Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story set in Japan.
1.0 	 They had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976) etc.
0.99 	 A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.<br /><br />No surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex (McClure) assuming the role of the wife's lover.<br /><br />Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion.
1.0 	 If you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.<br /><br />BEST SCENE - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, Japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show.
0.99 	 They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup.
0.56 	 Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so.
0.59 	 Whatever their motives for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of him.
0.99 	 He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes.
0.73 	 The action scenes were not bad,but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting.
0.59 	 It took the main character almost half an hour to get in action.
1.0 	 She does her best to make it all work.
0.53 	 Yes,this movie could have been much better with a great director.
1.0 	 And for an action/stunt coordinator of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes.
0.59 	 ** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS!
0.81 	 Of course you have to rescue her, and it is quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes.
1.0 	 Graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but that isn't extremely often).
0.58 	 In the previews, "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't.
0.8 	 Too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely.
0.95 	 What's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called "The 40 Year-old Virgin.
1.0 	 It could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low.
0.73 	 A bit arrogant, I know, but would you ("you" is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of "The 40 Year-Old Virgin"?<br /><br />Of course Andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with "morning rise" (don't ask), and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex.
0.69 	 But you know that such escapades will only end in disaster, as proved by one date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst drunk-driving experience I think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.<br /><br />Things brighten up for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on eBay for people.
0.79 	 Hmmm.
0.96 	 This isn't a total bomb--the cast is fairly good with pros John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine giving the best performances.
0.98 	 Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him?
0.9 	 We needed more information about them and less Parking Lot/Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying "What do you want?"
0.94 	 <br /><br />The 2nd part: Danny wants his buddy, Tony, to beat him up while he jacks-off.
0.78 	 This tale lacks the all-important transition from "I'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun" to "I think I might be gay and hitting him because I'd like to spread his ass and do him S/M style."
0.95 	 A very important thing to leave out.<br /><br />Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time.
0.51 	 The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought.
0.71 	 Sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators.
0.81 	 You're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie.<br /><br />This is both a quality and a drawback of the script.
0.59 	 As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency.
1.0 	 It's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man.
0.99 	 Especially such a shallow and inconstant man.
1.0 	 He's obviously a player (I wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!).
1.0 	 I wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chase after him!
1.0 	 His sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me.<br /><br />Apart from that subplot, I did like the movie.
0.97 	 <br /><br />Anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dancing was worth watching the film for.
0.98 	 I have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land.
0.83 	 This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
0.96 	 I guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music?
0.63 	 <br /><br />Is William Daniels' campy contemporary (for the time) acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s/70s demographic?
0.92 	 Imperfect, as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget, but the drama is involving-- it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad nauseum on Cinemax 2 or More Max or whatever they call it, you end up watching 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to be going to work.
0.64 	 Save your time.
0.85 	 1 star.
1.0 	 Filmatography: Excellent, nice camera angles (I don't remember seeing a movie of late, with good close-ups, until this one).
1.0 	 NY is pictured good.I liked the upside down angles, in particular (a different touch).<br /><br />Music: Not impressive.
0.79 	 His age and belly really show up.
0.59 	 It was a very awkward to see a mature/aged star still trying to play like a 20+ heroes scenes.
1.0 	 Love can be expressed at any age; as we get older, you still can express love nicely from a distance (without touching a woman too much.
0.89 	 For example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi").<br /><br />Jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie.
0.72 	 Well, that is not my problem, I guess.<br /><br />Others just have a small presence.<br /><br />Direction: I expected Gautham to excel (or measure-up) to his other movie "Kakka Kakka".
0.85 	 He disappointmented me.
0.9 	 It took a long time to release the movie due to various issues.
0.72 	 DEFINITELY not for kids (and adults who expect some kind of "Entertainment").<br /><br />Thx
0.93 	 Thoughtless, ignorant, ill-conceived, career-killing (where is the talented Angela Jones now?
0.89 	 It's no wonder Reb Braddock hasn't directed anything else since - anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and creates something like THIS, anyone who feels that THIS was a story worth telling to the world, doesn't deserve a second break.
0.95 	 Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they're told to do, and they do it well.
0.78 	 Gayniggers from Outer Space is pretty much summed up by its name.
0.81 	 Running only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to Earth to free the men from women.
0.85 	 If you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, its very accessible and easy to see through to the end.
0.99 	 Some parts are hilarious.
0.99 	 I can't really recommend it; if you do watch it, do so for the unique concept, not the quality.
1.0 	 What I got was scare after scare.
0.99 	 It's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore.
0.96 	 This film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters.
0.88 	 They become haunted no matter where they are.
0.69 	 Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc.
0.81 	 After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didn't like this film.
0.58 	 It scared the s**t out of me.
0.5 	 This is not a good movie.
0.98 	 Surprise, surprise.
0.99 	 Welcome to the music business.
0.97 	 I can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie.
1.0 	 If you want to support these films by going to see them - great!
1.0 	 If you enjoyed it - super!
0.93 	 To each his own.
0.51 	 Pleeeease!
0.97 	 Wanna see a good African-American movie?
0.96 	 See Love Jones.
0.68 	 Ray.
0.99 	 Or The Color Purple.
1.0 	 Because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater.
0.59 	 Just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film.
0.94 	 It's only good -- when it's good.
0.82 	 Like most people, i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the box, and the assumption (from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film) that this film is all about the Beast from the East kickin' ass for 90 minutes.<br /><br />However, to my disappointment, Chinese Hercules is to Bolo Yeung what No Retreat No Surrender was to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger was to... erm, Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure on video box, minimum actual screen-time!
0.58 	 Oh well!
1.0 	 <br /><br />The storyline is pretty basic stuff, but it was well done - peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again.
0.88 	 He then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess, causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter (dont quite know how that works but never mind).
0.65 	 Meanwhile, the corrupt boss of the pier does a deal with gangsters, giving them exclusive use of the pier.
0.96 	 ), badly shot and at times performed by people who didn't seem to have any martial arts ability.... in fact, most of the fights in this film weren't 'fights' at all, just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance!<br /><br />Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min.
0.98 	 <br /><br />Really, the big saving grace in this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung.
1.0 	 Not only is he as huge and brutal as ever, he has some great, funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master-class on how to fight on film.
0.99 	 The guy oozes screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star.
0.86 	 The guy scares the life out of me, but i'm sure i wasn't the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for Bolo all through the end fight!
0.71 	 <br /><br />All in all then, a below-average kung-fu film lifted several huge notches due to you-know-who.
1.0 	 I've never met a person who didn't think Bolo Yeung was great.
0.99 	 The man's a legend!
0.51 	 !
0.91 	 So he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him.
0.99 	 Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this film yet, avoid it like the plague.
0.64 	 Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall.<br /><br />For Chris' efforts I give it a 2/10!<br /><br />
0.78 	 As close to black and white without being black and white.
0.65 	 I'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks.
0.52 	 In this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with, or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot.
0.51 	 Too bad, the film could have been great.
0.61 	 saved the movie in this category.<br /><br />For heaven's sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!
0.99 	 I love the book, "Jane Eyre" and have seen many versions of it.
0.94 	 All have their strong points and their faults.
1.0 	 <br /><br />That brings us to Mr. Rochester.
0.88 	 Rochester!)
1.0 	 version is far more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A/E version (which is NOT all that true to the book).<br /><br />Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
0.83 	 who is part of a new urban legend: if your cell-phone rings with a strange tone--and you see the message 'One Missed Call'--you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death.
0.96 	 Most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on the future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!)
0.79 	 You should leave the theater feeling, at least, partly good-- if you're able to suspend being aghast at killing people.
1.0 	 Was VH-1 treading on hollow ground here?
0.96 	 I mean, Harris and Quinn don't really look or even sound like John or Paul.
0.61 	 It's far from the exploitation film I expected.
1.0 	 But the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless I'm just too dumb to pick up on them).
0.56 	 What led to the boys' break-up?
1.0 	 But as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying.
0.8 	 My wife and I have watched this movie twice.
0.98 	 Sure, it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires.
0.52 	 Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way, hitch to their home(at dusk), and invite their prey...sex-starved men to their boudoir.
0.99 	 Director Jose Ramon Larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera.
0.62 	 We have the two girls.
0.75 	 We are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol.
0.69 	 What does it mean" Why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago?
0.98 	 Of course I have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice-looking girls doing as vampires in the English countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the Carpathians?
0.98 	 There are, as I said, some effective scenes by the director...I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey.
1.0 	 The house is also a most impressive set.
1.0 	 And both girls are as I said very lovely.
0.97 	 Marianne Morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one.
0.93 	 For you older film fans, silent screen veteran Bessie Love has a brief cameo at film's end.
0.57 	 Over and over again the same footage.
0.95 	 OK, first of all, ignore the last person' review.
1.0 	 They admit to falling asleep through it so it's no wonder they didn't understand what was going on!!!
0.98 	 As thriller/horrors go, this film ain't too bad, it is certainly very watchable.
0.85 	 They did that on purpose!!
0.97 	 Plot's nothing fancy, but the acting is right on the mark.
0.58 	 Worth a look.
0.99 	 It is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion, but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff.
0.94 	 The film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events, there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost, meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be, emotional impact is lost also.
0.71 	 And, when watching something that vaguely purports to be "historical", whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy, some realistic idea of the "political map" of the time, even some slight flavour of the era, especially in its social attitudes.
0.94 	 Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America?
0.99 	 In other words, the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in Notorious is indictable today by Federal prosecutors in whatever (hostile) jurisdiction they choose.
0.98 	 Of course, there were no hearings in the Senate or elsewhere on this matter when the CDA was passed.
0.68 	 Of course you know nothing about it, because you don't want people in Peoria telling you what you can and cannot look at (likewise, people in Peoria probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view).
0.55 	 Of course Notorious will never be indicted.
0.67 	 It's Hollywood.
0.95 	 It's lawyered up.
0.89 	 Countless Klaws will, however, continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic, moral or biological composition much in 50+ years.<br /><br />In addition, Notorious posts no 18 USC 2257 compliance statement, which is mandated by the unnoticed "earmark" recently voted into law.
0.61 	 It takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked.
0.94 	 It is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt are playing the stupid, stereotyped Japanese guys.
0.73 	 But, it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters.
0.95 	 Stick to Martin & Lewis.
0.99 	 At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face.
0.64 	 A super comedy series from the 1990s (Two series were made in total) that suffered in the UK ratings due to poor scheduling.
0.51 	 I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have been watching something else.
1.0 	 Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel.
1.0 	 I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot.
1.0 	 There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing.
0.52 	 It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off.
0.72 	 You should check out this film.
0.69 	 It tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to.
0.99 	 The question is, can a movie this entertaining really be considered a "bad" movie?
0.59 	 Your basic plot as is follows: Grange, this goombaesque thug from planet Earth, robs "the bank of the Moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite and other minerals.
0.99 	 Then there's the nameless "Colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare.
0.82 	 Much of the movie centers around "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides) with explosions galore.
0.87 	 I can't even remember the names of the bands (they're listed in the credits) other than Exploding White Mice, because that was the only one I'd heard of before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely looking into them.<br /><br />Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends.
0.7 	 How can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5.4?!
0.93 	 Well, I do.
0.97 	 I'm only wondering what happened to Miss Porter?<br /><br />i gave Curly Sue a 7
0.51 	 There is a certain similarity to Elite(you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships, go on missions)however this game features a heavily scripted mission.
0.87 	 I haven't played any of the mods yet.
1.0 	 <br /><br />Sadly a sequel to this was cancelled, a shame!
0.87 	 Good production values for a Thai horror flick.
0.94 	 Only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in Asia in the last 15 years.
0.94 	 More perhaps we should point the finger at creator Mick Garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised TV remake of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'The Shining'.<br /><br />Perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today.
0.93 	 Unless of course they were studying for a degree from the University Of S**t.
0.95 	 Was anyone surprised when the movie's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths?
0.83 	 Only someone who has never before in his or her life, ever seen another movie!
0.97 	 All three professional women down-out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin, fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos.
0.96 	 This is a film that takes some digesting.
0.82 	 In particular, Ms. Keaton's performance is flighty and over the top, well below the quality of her Annie Hall and Sleeper days.
0.84 	 If it were `Rabbi Ray explains it all' or `Imam Muhammad explains it all', there would be rioting in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription.
0.71 	 Perhaps its biggest flaw was the fact that it didn't follow suit to most of the previous Survivor Series'.
0.87 	 There was only ONE survivor series match.
0.88 	 And that Survivor Series match went on for 45 minutes.
0.92 	 What's more, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock prevailing for his team.
0.53 	 And don't get me started on the preview before the event.
0.91 	 Whatever the storyline, it was just a wrestling event.<br /><br />And as for the rest of the matches: the first match was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow.
1.0 	 It was a good fast paced match and its good to see a heel winning a match fairly.
0.99 	 Edge versus Test was good but nothing great.
0.99 	 The tag titles steel cage match was the best match of the evening.
0.99 	 The Women's title match wasn't great.
0.69 	 The Alliance lost but guess what, after 5 months every single Alliance superstar returned.
0.97 	 Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just fall guys.
0.79 	 7 matches isn't enough for a Survivor Series.
0.5 	 If there's ever a Survivor Series as bad as this again I'll
0.84 	 To me the action is all I watched it for.<br /><br />May 23rd 1999.
0.89 	 That was my 19 birthday.
0.73 	 Instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of Canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong.
0.78 	 Not much you can do to change the situation.
0.75 	 Give me a break.
0.81 	 When someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it.
0.99 	 Owen will be missed and thanks for the memories for all the times you gave us.
0.7 	 There were a few interesting scenes, such as the "Big one" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that?

0.88 	 [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends.
1.0 	 I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin.
0.96 	 I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room.
1.0 	 Enslin reacts in a believable manner.
0.8 	 I'm encouraged and think to myself, this is going to be good.
0.57 	 Let's see, a clock radio that turns on by itself?
0.99 	 Good, that's always scary.
0.81 	 Objects that move around in the room?
0.98 	 Great.
0.8 	 Good.
0.97 	 It's all good.
0.53 	 When I go see a horror movie in a theater, it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments.
0.98 	 The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be.<br /><br />So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever?
0.9 	 Alan (Anthony Steffen), an English multi-millionaire with a few screws loose (thanks to his first wife's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth), entices sexy, red-headed women to his castle, offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend.
0.99 	 Their wedded bliss is short-lived, however, thanks to Alan's iffy mental state, which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife Evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds.<br /><br />So let's recap: a groovy 70s Euro-horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress; spooky Gothic retreats and misty graveyards; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop-dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods; several vicious murders (including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes).
0.91 	 (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list!!!
0.54 	 But Tallinn Pimeduses does that.
0.97 	 His first one, Kotia pÃ¤in was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night was just a weird mess.
0.98 	 Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.<br /><br />The Garden Of Allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with Mary Anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12.
0.94 	 The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French Tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world.
0.63 	 He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent.
0.97 	 The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.<br /><br />As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret.
0.94 	 Most especially Marlene Dietrich.
0.81 	 This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen.
0.97 	 And I'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state differently.
0.96 	 It lacks also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event.
1.0 	 A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem.
0.91 	 There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said, God become a man) that indeed changed mankind.

0.99 	 Your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful, most likely paid in cash for home, and you can't even put on a decent shirt?
0.91 	 And while you're at it, it's Christmas Eve.
0.79 	 Buy your kids some presents...or at least a Christmas tree.
0.86 	 Also, you're in you 50s.
0.76 	 AND THOSE NAMES?
0.62 	 Terry and Tammy.
0.9 	 Way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves.
1.0 	 It's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a "girl"...obviously Ms. Basinger had some say about what goes in the script.
1.0 	 It's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back.
1.0 	 Apparently, Della's magical ninja skills are impossible to beat.
1.0 	 Her driving skills are pretty nifty too.
0.51 	 Wahhhhh!
0.93 	 Or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at.
0.51 	 Boohooo!
0.9 	 Who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car, but not their purse, full of identifying artifacts such as your ADDRESS.
1.0 	 That powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive.
0.93 	 Singing "I'll Be Home For Christmas" in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets.
0.96 	 Thanks Della!
0.93 	 Cop and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he's as gritty as they come) is recruited to retrieve an American supertank that has been stolen & hidden in Mexico.
0.55 	 Captured with the tank were hardbitten Sgt.
0.64 	 Fluegel, who might have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a far bigger role in "Crime Story" than Julia!)
1.0 	 Jones, who's been in an amazing array of films, pretty much hits bottom right here.
0.97 	 Look for talented, future character actor Danny Trejo ("Heat," "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotyped, menacing bit part.
0.51 	 So, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie.
0.99 	 This is not horror, as the first part was: This is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment.
1.0 	 If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A.
0.68 	 Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be thought without the first movie, so I compare this to it.
0.53 	 Especially the personnel of the camp.
0.68 	 It's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp.
0.78 	 Outstanding acting by both principal actors.
0.97 	 This doesn't even feel like a movie...you feel like you're there.
0.98 	 Her identity is never revealed, despite an attempt by Jim and even investigators to discover who she is.
0.99 	 His marriage nearly flounders as his wife begins to think he's having an affair and trying to cover it up.
0.71 	 Based on a supposedly actual case, Jim's wife Kris suffered from multiple personality disorder and that was what ruined her marriage.
0.52 	 The movie is probably a little too long and boring in some parts but it's the kind of TV movie that usually does well, especially on Lifetime, which continues to produce films of this kind, of the "domestic thriller" type, or seduction stories.
0.88 	 In the end it fits in with the early 70's social activest type films.
0.51 	 2/10
0.9 	 It lacked life and spark.
0.84 	 I kept thinking during the film, you know, this movie would've worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director.
0.55 	 The critics I think are praising the film because they *want* to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels.
0.99 	 Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis.
0.91 	 Just because the characters in the movies and on TV act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so.
1.0 	 At very best, a three out of 10.
0.66 	 First a technical review.
0.51 	 The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional.
0.65 	 is really non-existent.
0.97 	 Without out the "lets shock 'em and get great publicity" scene nobody would be talking about this film.
0.65 	 For one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his MIA brother, St John).
0.83 	 Sure, The A-Team constantly referred back to Vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself.
0.9 	 With Airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on.<br /><br />With hindsight, the Cold War setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology.
0.96 	 But that's really not the point.
0.82 	 Set your Sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the UK.
0.99 	 They dubbed my voice (thank goodness).<br /><br />David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes.
0.94 	 <br /><br />I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had "acting" in it.
0.78 	 Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved.
1.0 	 But sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters.<br /><br />Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool fight scenes, though riddled with recycled animation, but shallow plot and character development.
0.74 	 What kinda role it is?
0.96 	 Death as an enemy; Death as a reliever, Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body.
0.85 	 Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever.
0.73 	 No matter what moral standards you set up, death is unevitable, and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality.
0.96 	 Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this, which is fully excused, since they of course will live forever...<br /><br />This is no exploitation movie.
0.83 	 Why?
0.74 	 Because death does not exploit us humans.
0.61 	 It harvests us.
0.94 	 At first glance it may seem very dark.
0.71 	 Consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die.
0.98 	 "<br /><br />I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body, that are being consumed by maggots, he shows not only decomposition, but GENERATION of new life.
0.99 	 Seven are the days of week (weak, mortal !
0.93 	 In fact Shayan Munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the Abhays role but Shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off.<br /><br />I would suggest watching the series if it is available.
1.0 	 The acting of the TV actors was much better than these "stars".<br /><br />The only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour(or 45 minutes) story to 2+ hours.
1.0 	 So it has to get draggy.
1.0 	 The director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film.
1.0 	 The deliver just wasn't right.<br /><br />But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy.
0.89 	 No credit should be given to the director/scriptwriter.
0.6 	 I saw this in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday I saw it again on cable.
0.71 	 This I was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is.
0.99 	 The nice guys finish last, the jerky guys make out great, the jerkiest guys do best.
0.71 	 Only one character ("Wendy") is seen doing anything remotely useful to society, and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a throwaway one-night stand with a scumbag, in a lushly filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic.
0.55 	 with a plot that makes your average middle-school writer look good, and acting which is almost as good, it gets my bottom score.
0.97 	 one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn't have the pleasure to be real picky.
0.94 	 Watching the commercials for this movie, I was fairly convinced that I was going to loathe it.
0.89 	 For one thing, it was one of those "loosely based on the novel" movies, which usually means that the book author saw the script, hated it, and refused to be associated with the film.
0.96 	 Worse, the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable (ex: kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose...and falls over).
0.97 	 A prime example of this comes directly after the boys' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet.
0.85 	 The boys do a lame, over-exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them, which makes it realistic since all little kids think (mistakenly) that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors.
0.99 	 Then one of the boys asks, "Why did he say, 'alley oop'?"
0.84 	 Another boy responds, "Maybe he's crazy!"
0.75 	 and the entire group laughs uproariously.
0.52 	 As if to confirm it, my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on-screen; I could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation.<br /><br />Another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying, sibling relationships, the new kid in school, and peer pressure/conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special.
1.0 	 There's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other, and very little of it comes across as corny.<br /><br />The only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous McDonald's dance party in "Mac and Me" would scoff at.
0.98 	 Why oh why was it put into the movie??
0.87 	 I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies.
0.99 	 <br /><br />The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from NYC to LA in order to get over her recently troubled loss.
0.94 	 Summing up it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore.
0.91 	 I am an avid B-Rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures, so I have a substantial gauge to judge this film by.
0.69 	 It easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer.
0.9 	 Keep in mind, the movie artwork is for a completely different film.
0.84 	 People start to die and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her.
0.67 	 Is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student?
0.99 	 Forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does Seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is of the "extras" caliber of acting).
0.85 	 More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them.
0.99 	 But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming "I don't have any change!!"
0.95 	 Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people.
0.98 	 Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.<br /><br />The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies.
0.97 	 They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem.
0.78 	 Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself.
1.0 	 However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies.
0.79 	 Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head.
0.89 	 I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can't imagine why she decided to do this film.
0.6 	 Up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment!
0.81 	 All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen.
0.54 	 Especially Jon Voight.
0.51 	 A must see motion picture!
0.97 	 The film's premise is intriguing enough: It's about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker.
0.86 	 This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane, and violent lifetime after lifetime.
0.85 	 I mean, we are talking about "Berserkers" here, aren't we?
0.88 	 Four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear.
0.54 	 Better still, both yummy blonde Marisol Santacruz and lovely brunette Adriana Vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits.
0.53 	 At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story.
0.51 	 Yeah, all right.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production.
0.62 	 The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes.
0.99 	 Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job).
0.51 	 (4/10)
1.0 	 Aesthetically, it's lackluster and cheap looking, the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive, but this adds to it's charm.
0.5 	 2.
1.0 	 Always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the Spiritual world.
0.84 	 However, this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction.
1.0 	 The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an outstanding performance in his native land England, and we have seen him in "Still Standing" a TV Series.
1.0 	 Heath Ledger, played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in "Brokeback Mountain",'05, gave a great supporting role.
0.77 	 Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith.
0.73 	 Probably somebody heard of Alberto Tomba.
0.6 	 The script it's simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 years old kid work.
0.77 	 Lose this one and make yourself a favour.
0.99 	 Some having more to do with the scheme of things than others, but there's no doubts every one of them are committed, despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all.
0.97 	 The script does throw around many characters, as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in.
0.97 	 First off, I would just like to say what a big fan of Bette Midler's I am.
0.74 	 I give it 4 out of 4!
0.98 	 Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert Earth's impending environmental collapse.
0.53 	 Patti Smith is missing in action, but not Sandra.
0.87 	 Barbara Streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but Sandra more than makes up for where Babs leaves off.
0.67 	 It is my opinion that many (and i mean, MANY) comics have lifted, okay outright stolen, so much from this show if not from Sandra herself.
0.96 	 I won't name names but come on, people, you and i know who they are.
0.98 	 Most comedians couldn't even touch where Sandra is coming from or going to.
0.98 	 You can't deny this lady's presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage.
0.99 	 She's still here, damn it, even after the release of Without You I'm Nothing, some 15 years ago.
0.99 	 Describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse.
1.0 	 On itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story.
0.58 	 Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed.
0.72 	 TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the better made, but there's just nothing like Bill and Ted.
0.94 	 It wasn't long before work began on the sequel.
0.98 	 There couldn't have been a better director for the job.
1.0 	 It doesn't change the characters like most sequels do.
0.84 	 This is because it was written by the original writers.
0.99 	 Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one, but since 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same screenwriters, it ended up being just as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' if not even better.
0.99 	 Life's a bitch, so he gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to help on the mission.<br /><br />The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa, who stunk up Anaconda.
1.0 	 When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was being broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled.
1.0 	 I adore M. C. Beaton's books about the wonderful Scottish Constable.
1.0 	 The characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written.
0.82 	 Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R&R too!
0.97 	 As Mr. Spock would say, the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like, of course, Mr. Spock's final one at the end--when he asks the Captain, McCoy et al whether they enjoyed their R&R and they answer in the affirmative, he raises an eyebrow and says "Fascinating..." in only the way Mr. Spock could do that.
1.0 	 An interesting story line, of course, the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying "amusement" of Disneyland, for example), being able to have one's wishes actually come true.
0.97 	 The main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget.
0.92 	 Who now find a parking space Â in a mall,downtown, or in the street - taken by a car whose driver can't remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world?<br /><br />Who hasn't the urge to "rubber out" the ill mannered spat?<br /><br />Haven said that I ask: - Did you identify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)?
0.89 	 In a scale of 1(Awful) to 10(Master Piece), I rate "When She Was Out" a 7(Regular).
0.6 	 Let me start off by saying that I didn't watch this movie at first with high expectations.
0.92 	 More breakups than you can imagine.
0.68 	 EXTREMELY one-sided characters with no real depth to them...
0.59 	 Never a good sign.
0.99 	 I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons.
0.59 	 If you really want to see a tearjerker look elsewhere.
0.93 	 I cannot recall a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me.
0.55 	 i think it should be in 250.
0.53 	 Lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since American pie or the original vacation.
0.84 	 Makes 'Utopia' look like a dignified swan song.
0.76 	 THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE was considered so distasteful in 1959 that several cuts and the passage of three years was required before it was released in 1962.
0.95 	 Today it is difficult to imagine how anyone could have taken the thing seriously even in 1959; the thing is both lurid and lewd, but it is also incredibly ludicrous in a profoundly bumptious sort of way.<br /><br />The story, of course, concerns a doctor who is an eager experimenter in transplanting limbs--and when his girl friend is killed in a car crash he rushes her head to his secret lab.
0.98 	 Not hardly.
0.99 	 But back at the lab, the head has developed a chemically-induced psychic link with another one of the doctor's experiments, this one so hideous that it is kept locked out of sight in a handy laboratory closet.
0.97 	 Can they work together to get rid of the bitter and malicious lab assistance, wreck revenge upon the doctor, and save the woman whose body he hankers for?
0.74 	 Could be!
1.0 	 Busty babes gyrate to incredibly tawdry music, actors make irrational character changes from line to line, the dialogue is even more nonsensical than the plot, and you'll need a calculator to add up the continuity goofs.
0.79 	 The cuts made before the film went into release are forever lost, but the cuts made for television have been restored in the Alpha release, and while the film and sound quality aren't particularly great it's just as well to recall that they probably weren't all that good to begin with.<br /><br />Now, this is one of those movies that you'll either find incredibly dull or wildly hilarious, depending on your point of view, so it is very hard to give a recommendation.
1.0 	 Roger Corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors/producers in history.
0.96 	 "The Trip", for example, as well as this imaginatively titled "Gas-s-s-s" can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation.
0.91 	 In other words, they're incredibly strange hippie-culture influenced movies.
0.76 	 The plot is simply and yet highly effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25.
1.0 	 This *could* be the basic premise of an atmospheric, gritty and nail-bitingly suspenseful post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trippy" road-movie comedy.
0.73 	 Definitely not my cup of tea, but the film does have a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who am I to say that it's not worth your time or money?
0.99 	 I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional.<br /><br />The other thing - impressive hand of the movie director.
0.57 	 <br /><br />And little bit more.
0.74 	 But it ISN'T.
0.99 	 I haven't had so much fun watching a film in years.
0.51 	 !
0.61 	 Season one story line was more interesting, a light side to the life at Jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the X-series.
0.91 	 I really hate most end of the world movies.
0.99 	 I've been to L.A. many times, I have family that works in show business, and I just want to say that these are the *last* people we should be looking to for a reality check.
0.78 	 I was in the 2nd grade.
0.92 	 But let's go back and look at this for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, not when I was eight is this about Bud & Sissy's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at Gilley's riding the bull.
0.76 	 Sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and Wes asks her if "she needs any help".
0.97 	 They're all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam, "when are you going to take me home and rape me?"
0.86 	 <br /><br />Anyways, that's my interpretation.
0.88 	 Paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called comedic movie..
0.58 	 Blood Surf AKA Krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller, Taryn Reif, Kate Fischer, Duncan Regehr, Joel West, Matt Borlenghi, Maureen Larrazabal, Cris Vertido, Susan Africa, Archie Adamos, Rolando Santo Domingo, and Malecio Amayao.
1.0 	 The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising.
0.99 	 The movie is filmed fairly good as well.
0.87 	 Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end.
1.0 	 This is a fairly thrilling film.
0.67 	 If you the the cast in the film, Monsters, Giant Animal films, Horror, Thrillers, Mystery, and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today!
0.91 	 This movie will kick your ass!
0.91 	 Why would would anyone want to stay in Coalville and develop black lung anyway?
0.98 	 When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in drag in this movie, my expectations that I would watch the entire movie were low.
0.53 	 He transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion.
0.75 	 I've told the police you're threatening me".
0.99 	 The good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy.
0.98 	 OH MY GOD!
1.0 	 Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team, he laboured under contract to Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheapies, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood features.
0.81 	 And where did they get that title 'West of Hot Dog'?
0.89 	 (As in the opening scene of the stage play 'Machinal'.)
0.98 	 <br /><br />'West of Hot Dog' was produced and co-directed by Joe Rock.
1.0 	 Among his many other achievements, Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson, and he was subsequently best man at their wedding.
1.0 	 Full disclosure: In the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him.
0.63 	 There are a couple of 'impossible' gags here, including Laurel's method for mounting a horse.
1.0 	 For just one moment in this movie, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke into a run.
0.61 	 The plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in Keaton's feature 'Our Hospitality' but (again) suffers by comparison: here, two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot Stan.
0.9 	 However, the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies.
0.98 	 As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision, not the previous owner's decision.
0.99 	 Hang on, Stan: in a few more years you'll be one-half of a comedy legend.
0.62 	 The movie never, and I do mean never, lets up in action.
0.71 	 It may be mild action but it's action.
0.91 	 Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne.<br /><br />All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and this is no exception.
0.88 	 The action, the stakes, the plot.
0.79 	 How they do it I will never know.
0.98 	 3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for Stanley Tucci to be a producer/moody deep doctor.
0.98 	 This programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for Neurlogical cases - yet there's nothing interesting or exciting going on!
0.99 	 In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father - snooze!
0.98 	 Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural.
1.0 	 She played her part with great perfection.<br /><br />SPOILERS!
0.96 	 The story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before.
0.65 	 She breaks up, he finds another, she get jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end.
0.55 	 This crew-versus-monsta has been done a hundred times, sometimes better.
0.96 	 Went straight to video in France.
1.0 	 I never saw the movie version until very lately on cable, and watched it with anticipation, to see my memories brought alive again, because I adored the original show.
0.95 	 They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul.
0.99 	 I was expecting a trip down memory lane, singing to the extraordinarily touching Music and the Mirror, At the Ballet, and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen.
0.98 	 The original had enough pathos on its own.
0.88 	 Let us just say that the televised "Dallas" was the authentic "heir," even if contemp(tuous) latterday "Texans" like Lay and DELay, not to mention our putative "president" of these here Yewbenighted States of Amurrika, perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions.
0.89 	 I never read Edna Ferber's original, but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein.
0.93 	 What's that there in the skies?
0.52 	 Is it Superman??
0.83 	 He/she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path.
0.6 	 The first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence!
0.99 	 How can you not love that?
0.82 	 There's very little else to write about this Japanese (and American re-edited) Sci-Fi effort, apart from that it's an obvious and totally shameless rip-off of such classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms.
0.65 	 Respectable actors like Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem unaware of what film set they're on and even the original Japanese mayhem-scenes aren't very convincing.
0.93 	 Gammera's very own and personalized theme-song is rather cool, though, so it gets one extra point for that.
1.0 	 Thankfully, Disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent '80s movies.
0.67 	 ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under another name.)
0.75 	 Misfits at a military school?
0.89 	 Hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some.
0.8 	 You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the sex crazy teen, the smart mouth, the pot smoker, and not to forget, the guy who burns things.
0.94 	 "Cat in the Hat?"
0.72 	 "<br /><br />You know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart.
0.99 	 Congratulations, producers, you've met your target market.
0.81 	 She also liked "Grease II," so you're in good company.<br /><br />Back on topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific (you guessed it) order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor.
0.99 	 If you want Scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother.
0.75 	 Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores, though in fact the less you see of the creature, the better.
0.64 	 )<br /><br />I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set.
1.0 	 My main reason for being interested in it is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; he's a pretty good actor, and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his career.<br /><br />The other thing is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work.
1.0 	 Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful.
0.98 	 The kids are asked to drive it, and while they do an okay job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have Brains' eight-year-old son flying T2, an enormous multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick.
0.99 	 Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood, but he can only do so much with a one-dimensional role.
1.0 	 If you can accept the film on its very slim merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, enjoyable ride.
0.77 	 Watch the original show, and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />And a word of advice to Jon Frakes.
0.96 	 Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild.
0.54 	 Last night.
0.94 	 And yes, I came in roughly in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island.
0.98 	 As it is, it's just another beloved childhood joy that's been ruined.
0.63 	 Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it.
0.91 	 Coming out of it, I wasn't really amazed nor disappointed.
0.9 	 Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies.
0.88 	 There were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny.
0.92 	 I totally gotta try that out next time I find myself in a club.
0.65 	 She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run.
0.99 	 I see it as a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull.
0.94 	 I can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila).
0.78 	 A series of random, seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister's boarding house has Miss Lemon quite agitated.
0.99 	 A ring, light bulbs, a rucksack, a lighter, a stethoscope, a shoe Â there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it.
0.74 	 And Poirot's fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered.
0.75 	 The major points of the mystery are all there Â the petty thefts, the boarding house, the students, the ripped rucksack, and, of course, Poirot's ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens.
0.62 	 If you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene, you would have something straight out of an early 70s Giallo.
0.99 	 In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock could have been used in a Giallo.
0.99 	 It's just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked.
0.73 	 The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they weren't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting didn't allow for that!
0.94 	 Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode (though I did smile at the 'Lemon sole' throwaway line).
0.99 	 Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others.
0.9 	 The murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL?
0.52 	 The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history.
0.71 	 When I say " Doctor Who " you might conjure up an image of Tom Baker , or Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison .
0.8 	 When I say " James Bond " you`ll almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small handful of people may think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan .
0.71 	 But when I say " Sgt Bilko " absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers .
1.0 	 After getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected Sharps magazine run by a reliably on form Jeff Bridges in New York.
0.96 	 It's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead.
1.0 	 The unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for the laughs but they don't exactly set the screen ablaze with their passion.<br /><br />Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine.
0.69 	 Of course he's eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox).
0.96 	 Please come back to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
0.99 	 Good job Sci-Fi keep the comedy movies coming.
0.51 	 !
0.59 	 The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you don't have to have seen the original.
0.54 	 Unfortunately this is also it's biggest drawback.
0.98 	 First of all, I have to say I have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something I haven't seen.
0.71 	 BeLyt must be out of his mind, I've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about.
0.95 	 Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2, but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well..maybe its just me.
0.89 	 The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye.
0.57 	 But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance.
0.56 	 I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments.
0.93 	 Plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief.
0.87 	 I'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/TV/literature/life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even).
0.99 	 Otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully.
0.99 	 This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons.
0.69 	 In fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as I speak.<br /><br />Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one.
0.99 	 Instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star.<br /><br />The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity.
0.57 	 Lindsay Anderson was very much a European film maker , whereas the likes of David Lean , Ridley Scott and Alan Parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope Anderson`s movie are more about social commentary and subtext , so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience <br /><br />What you think of IF comes down to what you think of British film makers .
0.99 	 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France .
0.75 	 You can just imagine every single French leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax .
1.0 	 French new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it , and many will dislike it intensely
1.0 	 Julia Stiles is a talented young actress, who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential.
0.53 	 I didn't go to the movies and see this, but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie.
0.57 	 I would recommend it!
0.98 	 The Omega Man comes to mind.
0.58 	 Additionally, the set-up and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming infectious fatal disease.
0.96 	 A movie SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them.
0.93 	 The problem is the young person is a girl and girls (or women for that matter) are not allowed into football matches to "sit with men".
0.61 	 There are some excellent set pieces, not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and, of course, the stadium has no toilets for women.
0.77 	 Yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite.
0.98 	 As the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs.
0.97 	 I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year.
1.0 	 How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected?
0.99 	 It's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented.
0.97 	 It's such a shame that this really is the end.
0.51 	 I could watch it all over again.
1.0 	 Jet Li, is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world.
0.57 	 He has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame.
0.54 	 First of all, it is dubbed.
1.0 	 Fans see Jet Li's movies for the fantastic martial arts.
0.95 	 Other times, a scene is left hanging (ie Li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the badguys arm their guns, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car!)
0.69 	 And are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask on?
0.97 	 Wouldn't the hair, lower jaw, or voice give it away?<br /><br />If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple.
0.99 	 If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be "up" for this movie.
1.0 	 Similar to Unleashed (which was great,) Dog Bite Dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding.
0.66 	 The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see.
0.5 	 The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling.
0.68 	 And in the end, you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary.<br /><br />On the plus side, the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies Â so those who aren't familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood's predictability should check it out.<br /><br />The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film.
0.99 	 Ultimately, in the end, we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us Â tetanus.<br /><br />4/10
1.0 	 The three stories are cute & amusing, although the songs were forgettable.
1.0 	 When an out-of-towner is stabbed to death at a floating crap game operated by Merrill, the hair-trigger Andrews roughs up a witness, causing him a fatal crack to the skull (exacerbated by a steel plate installed in the veteran's head).
0.8 	 Realizing that his job's already on the line, Andrews dumps the body in the river after making it look like the suspect had taken a powder.<br /><br />Of course, that's far from an end to it.
0.81 	 A film without conscience.
0.54 	 Then they double cross him.
0.96 	 Meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife, and, without her knowing he's the killer, moves in with her.
0.96 	 Then, in a WALKING TALL kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him.
0.95 	 The first problem is that, by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment, the drifter loses all sense of sympathy, worthiness, and heroism.
0.98 	 And the wife (nicely played by the fetching Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people, similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter (despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband).
0.51 	 Stoo-pid.
1.0 	 George Wendt, however, is terrific in a role as a beefy thug.
0.95 	 The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the "I do's" with fiancÃ© Henry(Paul Rudd).
0.99 	 After two years Henry has yet to move on and his sister Chloe(Lindsay Sloane)is very concerned.
0.97 	 Chloe arranges for Henry to talk with an attractive psychic Ashley(Lake Bell).
1.0 	 Ashley is to contact Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life.
0.54 	 There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film.
0.85 	 Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey.
0.94 	 I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker.
0.67 	 After catching some disease in space, an astronaut comes back to Earth and starts melting.
0.87 	 I can't for the life of me remember why--I must have had a free ticket or something--but I saw this movie in the theater when it was released.
0.74 	 That was hands-down THE most terrifying moment ever recorded on film.<br /><br />The plot, if I recall correctly, involved John Ritter and perhaps his wife (Lord, how I've tried without success to block this film out of my mind) adopting a "problem child."
0.81 	 Forget Damian, forget Rosemary's Baby.
0.99 	 This kid takes the cake.
0.88 	 1/10, only because I can't give it a negative score, which is what it really deserves.
0.94 	 It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ.
1.0 	 Judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly mistaken man, horribly misguided in his zeal.
0.94 	 The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is.
0.92 	 It's a movie that should be watched closely; some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them.
0.86 	 For instance, keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of the pricing gun at the pet store...and also on the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of scenes.
1.0 	 As a child the first installment ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie.
1.0 	 It was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family film.
0.54 	 A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time.
0.58 	 I think that I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I have grown up.
0.59 	 However, it is not a bad film.<br /><br />It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody.
0.65 	 As Melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go.
0.64 	 Trouble stirs up as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out.
1.0 	 I did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing.
1.0 	 I think this is a good family film though overall!
0.93 	 Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman.
1.0 	 There is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film.
0.98 	 The only error that I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note.
0.63 	 Speakman's considerable kempo skill (nice spin kicks, decent with the sticks - poor couch!)
1.0 	 That has been done in great detail already, many times over.
0.94 	 It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan's face in the bar in 'Russia' (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island).
0.99 	 This film really got off to a great start.
1.0 	 It had the potential to turn into a really heartrending, romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes.
1.0 	 It really didn't need to be anything more than that, and for a moment there I became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake, another timeless classic, a modern myth perhaps.
1.0 	 Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential.
0.92 	 Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan.
0.54 	 One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.
0.98 	 I can't really condemn the movie because it does work.
0.91 	 Sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that.
0.52 	 Worth watching once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then putting away.
0.76 	 Yanks, although the real Scotland may be just as colourful, if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to "dance out" controversies with the locals.
0.88 	 Other than that I'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists.
0.98 	 Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots.
0.99 	 Nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or Ph.d's(again, perhaps).
0.63 	 It is dangerous, but only slightly historical.
0.76 	 It has no guns.
0.99 	 This is not a problem.
0.98 	 Peace is not desperate.
1.0 	 So many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" mocks them ("Why Study Industrial Arts?"
0.74 	 Mr. Sirk laid the path for what would follow later on in the soap operas genre, mainly, "Dallas" and "Dynasty", just to mention two.<br /><br />The fact is this movie was shot entirely inside a studio.
0.98 	 Most of the decor is phony.
0.75 	 Like a lot of those 1950s pictures, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in a studio lot.
0.69 	 Having never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this movie on a clean slate.
0.76 	 Sure, some of the acting by Sondre Locke made me a little squeemish - but hey, it was the 80's.
0.78 	 But even if you can't get past her (and I almost couldn't) or her revenge killings (which seemed a little.. overdone ;P), it's worth it just for Dirty Harry.
0.54 	 Or at the very least, the bull dog he affectionately names 'MeatHead' :P<br /><br />7/10.
0.61 	 There are some good things about the movie.
1.0 	 The music and cinematography is great.
1.0 	 Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance.
0.98 	 Ryan Bauer is also hot.
0.73 	 The production was very lucky to have casted them because they really give production value to the movie.
0.92 	 Jonny Vincent (Sean) and a lot of the boys in the movie that don't speak are cute too.
0.99 	 Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink.<br /><br />The worse thing about the movie is probably the star, James Townsend.
0.66 	 His arms are like spaghetti.
0.74 	 They should have casted someone else as the lead if they wanted what's best for the movie.
0.92 	 I feel that the character of Lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better.
0.92 	 I'd recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under-laying meaning of the movie and plot.
0.76 	 Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint, it doesn't fail to question it, and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost, not matter what, and cruelty is a common denominator.<br /><br />What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize.
0.96 	 Still she doesn't come off as weak, in fact I think she's one of the stronger characters, she's always in control of the relationships, with the men just tagging.
0.86 	 You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries, so the prospect of of someone dying, while surely causing grief, didn't traumatise people like it does now.
0.67 	 He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut/manicure at the same time.
0.54 	 <br /><br />For Columbo completionists only.
0.64 	 I am SURE there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of.
0.61 	 Oh, and "Makes you think"?
0.52 	 Yeah, I was thinking "MOVE!
0.66 	 <br /><br />P.s.
0.95 	 This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too.
0.76 	 See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
0.99 	 ), an actually not-so-bad story, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!
0.94 	 It's one of those movies that's simply bad, yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night TV and cable.
1.0 	 "A Gentleman's Game" uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent's discovery about honesty, prejudice, and other life lessons.
0.84 	 And except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or linking of them.
0.99 	 <br /><br />First of all, the directing itself is quite good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) is magnificent.
0.7 	 No story at all, no message behind beautiful exploited talents.<br /><br />Or do I have to make people remember, the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story.
0.6 	 A simple story is it not?
0.82 	 Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered.
0.9 	 Smetimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
0.56 	 I have not seen this show in over 20 years.
0.64 	 I only remember two episodes, and I barely remember those.
0.51 	 I don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends.<br /><br />This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it.
0.99 	 Each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity, completely and utterly three dimensional.
0.99 	 Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut but aside from some minor surface similarities, Kubrick's is easily the more layered, artistic, and atmospheric picture.
0.89 	 A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement.
0.96 	 It wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic.
0.85 	 The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance.
0.6 	 However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability.<br /><br />4.
0.83 	 <br /><br />"step aside for hollywood veterans?"
0.58 	 This movie is just so good!
0.63 	 Go check it out.
0.99 	 It's one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isn't cheesy.
0.69 	 I wish Disney would make more pictures like it.
0.99 	 Don't get the wrong idea, I don't mean to bad mouth Disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and THAT'S OKAY.
0.96 	 But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail.
0.97 	 But not with Holes.
0.95 	 It's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny.
0.83 	 He is offering up a new stem cell technology that could make tons o' cash...or so it seems...This lures in several employees to his Moreau-ish island (must have been quite an impressive exit package from the company when he was let go for him to afford an island) to validate his scientific findings including the CEO and, co-incidentally, the ex-fiancÃ© of the mad scientist's son now morphed sharkuman (how convenient)....<br /><br />The plan, sort of, is to rekindle lost love between the former nuptials while exacting revenge on the former colleagues for his termination.
0.55 	 (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter?
0.95 	 Will a new species be created?
0.55 	 Watch it and find out.<br /><br />There is some entertainment value in this movie, but don't expect much...for the true Combs fan, this is not to be missed.
0.87 	 Interestingly, nobody in the Kay Linaker & Theodore Simonson screenplay ever refers to the amorphous, scarlet-red protoplasm that plummeted to Earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of Downingtown Pennsylvania on a Friday night as "The Blob."
0.92 	 Of course, neither McQueen nor Corsaut were teenagers, but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers.
0.67 	 Moreover, while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes, it remains largely anonymous.
0.58 	 In other words, the eponymous Jell-O neither talks nor communicates by telepathy.
1.0 	 Instead, it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody.
0.99 	 The meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick.
0.86 	 Hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation.
0.86 	 Of course, Hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the man's forearm.
0.71 	 Our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule Steve's fast driving.
0.62 	 Steve fools him into a reverse drive race, but the local police chief Dave (Earl Rowe) lets him off the hook.
0.99 	 During the interim, the blob has entirely absorbed the old geezer, killed Hallen's nurse and attacked the doctor.
1.0 	 Neither acid thrown on the protoplasm nor Hallen's shotgun have any effect on the blob.
0.99 	 When Steve and Jane go to the police department to report the incident, Dave is frankly incredulous, while Sergeant Bert (John Benson) believes that it is a prank.
0.97 	 Bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her car.<br /><br />Steve and Jane take them to Hallen's office, but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody, but Dave admits that the office has been vandalized.
0.63 	 Against Sgt.
1.0 	 No sooner have Steve and Jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again.
0.76 	 They drive into town and spot the old man's dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket.
0.99 	 They find nobody inside, but they encounter the blob.
1.0 	 Steve and Jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesn't attack them.
0.74 	 Police Chief Dave and the fire department arrive at the supermarket.
0.98 	 Steve tries to convince Dave that the blob is in the store.
1.0 	 About that time, the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers.
0.84 	 Suddenly, a horde of people exit the theater and Dave believes Steve.
0.95 	 Steve and Jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks.
0.81 	 The Pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the North Pole.
0.7 	 As the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack, the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark.
0.75 	 They never show the blob actually assimilating its victims and leave this to your imagination, so "The Blob" isn't without a modicum of subtlety.
0.76 	 The movie was a long awaited release, which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation's I had set up.
0.89 	 I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was o.k., but missing something.
0.96 	 Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off, or the labored line delivery of a leading lady.
0.83 	 The next day I kept thinking about the movie, though.
0.51 	 The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal.
0.58 	 Sure it ain't poifect...but there's a lot of laughs in this picture.
0.65 	 If you stick with it long enough in hopes of a satisfying conclusion Â good, bad, or surprising Â don't.
0.99 	 Costumes, hair-do's, and sets are starched, pressed, and immaculate.
0.51 	 Huh?!?
0.97 	 Want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of Westerns as we knew them?
0.75 	 Watch THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again.
0.95 	 Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really.<br /><br />Dr.
1.0 	 Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work.
0.85 	 Last note: watch for Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count On Me, Eternal Sunshine...) in this one.<br /><br />5/10.
0.5 	 I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!"
1.0 	 The Circle-Vision is disorienting.
0.72 	 And when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous!
0.67 	 You get entertained while sitting down, right?
0.97 	 NOT FUN.
0.59 	 Skip it.
1.0 	 Move directly to the United Kingdom.
0.59 	 To be honest, I don't think that I've ever<br /><br />laughed at something as much as this, including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse.
0.88 	 The people seem to have no substance, the lead protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redemptive values, in fact everyone in it including Jon Voight epitomizes sleeze.
1.0 	 Another chapter in the ongoing question, whatever happened to Mel Brooks's sense of humor?
1.0 	 It starts out nicely enough, with Mel as Trump-like mogul Goddard Bolt ("You can call me God"), who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days.
0.59 	 The worst part is this movie's musical number, in which Brooks and Warren do a silent dance to Cole Porter's "Easy to Love."
0.81 	 Brooks's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies; here he plays the whole thing straight, like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on "The Carol Burnett Show" (on which Rudy DeLuca, this film's co-writer, began his career).
0.98 	 Go rent Charlie Chaplin's THE KID, which covered the same ground 70 years before and did a lot
1.0 	 It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus.
0.82 	 (Perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film).
0.72 	 Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure.
0.83 	 His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick of the hunt, and only goes along, because he is a failure at anything else.
0.87 	 Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is interested in her also.
0.94 	 In the end Taylor gets spooked by the buffalo, as many hunters before him had, and runs off leaving Sandy with the girl.
0.94 	 The film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in College.
0.66 	 black people.
0.63 	 I am a white male and I know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.<br /><br />The storyline which I will explain now revolves around three characters.
0.6 	 They all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah don't forget education.
0.99 	 If you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see American History X.
0.98 	 If you want to see a more accurate view of college rent Porkys.
0.98 	 The stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare.
0.52 	 One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and "Gymkata" happened to be on; I watched way too much of it.
0.99 	 It is indeed hilarious, and horrifying, really.
1.0 	 Overly long, needlessly layered, purveyor of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: so go the usual raps.
0.88 	 It is too long.
0.59 	 I found nothing flashy, contemporary or manipulative in this depiction.<br /><br />The very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension, which increased incrementally as the film progressed.
0.97 	 You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute.
0.92 	 For me, that happens rarely.
0.59 	 But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case, wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address, first in ones and twos, and then in ever-growing numbers.<br /><br />Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest, although not all at the same time.
0.89 	 Unarmed, unorganized, and leaderless, they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich.<br /><br />Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, anxious to have that city racially cleansed, was also in charge of the nation's public morale.
1.0 	 <br /><br />To both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable.
0.98 	 But they were mistaken.
0.92 	 I'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight, or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through.
0.88 	 by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that about put it over the top.<br /><br />The acting and special effects were at an all-time low also.
0.59 	 You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General.
0.56 	 Speaking of the General, where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers look-alike anyways?
1.0 	 A man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an "accident".
1.0 	 His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also VERY rich!
0.74 	 I saw this many times on Saturday afternoon TV as a kid.
0.79 	 Back then, I liked it but I WAS young.
0.91 	 <br /><br />The music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric.
0.84 	 There also are a few scary moments (I jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending.
0.96 	 Not a knock on Korman as he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show.
1.0 	 He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks' movies ("High Anxiety" comes to mind).
0.72 	 This one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place (I only saw this movie once a long time ago so I don't remember everything to clearly) and it starts out friendly enough.
0.84 	 Best to skip this one, but then you may want to check it out just for kicks.
0.58 	 A worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out.<br /><br />With such an outstanding case, one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins.
0.92 	 When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one?
0.82 	 I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas.
0.89 	 This one is definitely one to miss.
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least.
1.0 	 The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.
0.99 	 Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series.<br /><br />The plot has Jane's cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she'll come back to claim it.
0.8 	 They are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will.Hiring a great white hunter, who secretly wishes to capture Tarzan and sell him, the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles (more so because of the stock footage).
0.78 	 After lots of talk Jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of Tarzan and Jame making kissy face.
0.95 	 The last third where Tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life (it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to re-shoot the film).
1.0 	 To me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn't very good (except at the end).I would be hard pressed to explain it except I would have to say that it was the relationship between Weissmuller and O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane which kept people coming back.
1.0 	 Its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples.<br /><br />(I should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the Tarzan tree house.)
0.99 	 In general I have enjoyed Dolph's movies, so gave this one a try.
0.97 	 I have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers.
0.52 	 The movie in places seems to be chopped together.
0.55 	 As a bit of a Dolph fan, I kept waiting to see him in action.
0.59 	 It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way.
0.92 	 Ya know what, they didn't WANT to be like SCREAM.
0.79 	 Everyone's like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!".
0.92 	 Well, if I am not mistaking, SCREAM also copied other movies too!
0.67 	 In fact, just about EVERY horror movie copied an earlier one.
0.66 	 The title of this film nearly put me off watching it.
0.65 	 The occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour, and best of all it's a good british comedy.
0.64 	 The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or "delights" as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me.
1.0 	 Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says: "It's the best movie I have ever seen."
1.0 	 Though I do think the ending is flawed.
0.94 	 It felt too fast and too abrupt, as if something was missing.
0.95 	 Besides I'd say the movie isn't able to keep a high level.
0.52 	 Until now I've never seen Pegg any different.
0.95 	 Don't know whether it was a hard thing to do, but her performance was hot and way better than during "Transformers" (okay... probably that's no tough match).
0.83 	 Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like it (as I do) or find it annoying.
0.92 	 <br /><br />What you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie, if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end.
0.55 	 Kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show???!!!
0.94 	 The acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE!
0.99 	 Randy Travis was really good in his role.
0.74 	 What has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction?
0.98 	 I think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest.
0.95 	 The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work.
0.78 	 They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful.
0.84 	 Some folks will always misunderstand.
0.92 	 All in all the film is entertaining, but I constantly found myself saying "oh brother, what a load of ....".
0.92 	 If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead.
0.97 	 Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English.
0.58 	 It's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color.
0.99 	 This could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors.
0.88 	 There are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.
1.0 	 The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor.
0.65 	 I laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes.
0.58 	 or small children.
0.98 	 The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere.
0.61 	 I can't wait to get the DVD.
0.72 	 Don't read any more, just do it.<br /><br />For me, this is a 9/10 film.
0.96 	 After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink, which was part of a chemistry set.
1.0 	 Tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off, but Jerry sets fire to his paw!
0.63 	 Man, I hope little kids didn't ideas watching these cartoons back in the '40s and '50s!
0.99 	 Planning to go on his own Logan then spots this couple at a seaside cafÃ© and is fascinated with the young woman Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />With Logan's assistant and all around gofer Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss,somehow getting a $740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece he starts to work on Suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film.
0.76 	 It's not really known what exactly Suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she, like Jesus, could miraculously heal the sick?<br /><br />There's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical-like vision that changed his life forever.
0.71 	 Sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world, like this movie that he's in, and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on Suzanne.
0.86 	 It turns out that the crazed Logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate, on the helpless and tied up Suzanne, the actual crucification of Jesus Christ some 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />Hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow "The Second Coming of Suzanne" puts you through the same kind torture that Suzanne is put through by Logan and the makers of the film.
0.94 	 Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers.
0.93 	 This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight.
0.97 	 I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and get's you wandering about what is to come.......
0.98 	 Therefor I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading: 1!
0.71 	 I watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children..
0.87 	 The terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking.
0.65 	 And the sad thing is--internally she dies.
0.88 	 Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains.
0.75 	 I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed.
0.97 	 I'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio.
0.99 	 Fans of male full-frontal nudity, however...hmm, well...yes.
1.0 	 After 2 dismal earlier efforts, although not nearly as well known to the public, this is really a reboot of the Modesty character, and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made.
0.58 	 If Mel Brooks made a picture about the Mob in the 30's, it would probably look like this.
1.0 	 I was very excited about seeing this film, anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature, containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of "Rivers and Tides."
0.99 	 Which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim.<br /><br />The photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed "ethical" duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images, along the periphery.
0.92 	 And frankly, the images were not generally that impressive.
0.63 	 Finally!
1.0 	 This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness."
0.8 	 Excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness.
0.76 	 The acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a Saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped, then tried to put on a play in your garage.
0.91 	 At first I was weirded out that a TV show's main character could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I'd give it a shot.
0.83 	 Guess what?
0.57 	 She cracks me up!
1.0 	 This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died.
1.0 	 I'll try my best, though.
0.65 	 <br /><br />The upside?
0.7 	 Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly.
0.86 	 <br /><br />Well worth the price of rental.
0.98 	 This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989.
0.82 	 His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script.
0.99 	 Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character.
0.55 	 The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film.
0.58 	 Or released on DVD or screened on a cable channel like Amer.
0.96 	 My father and I were big fans as I was already a big science/electronics nut, (still am) and my father was an old school chum of Nader.
0.85 	 More so than any show that old.
0.62 	 Or the one where he body surfs the big ones, (I did that too!)
0.8 	 Or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a trance-like state.
1.0 	 The fencing in this serial is also a bit bad, but not terrible.
0.78 	 They only should have practised some more.
0.52 	 One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming, instead of in post-production.
0.72 	 Maybe.
0.97 	 Many critics found Fawcett's performance to be one-note, but for me, Marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me.
0.98 	 This is a film that belongs firmly to the 50's.
1.0 	 Very surprising that American Film Institute has chosen this one for one for the best 100 American movies of all-time.
0.78 	 His mental age is about 14.
0.95 	 If you want to see a good musical made on the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the Rain".
0.86 	 People that support her, please seek help you do NOT know what is funny.
0.87 	 The show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all.
0.92 	 Please give me my 20 minutes of my life back.
0.86 	 It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now.
0.72 	 Not when you think about it.
0.96 	 Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar.
1.0 	 If the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud.
0.72 	 It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots.
0.83 	 And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe.
0.99 	 Usually it's far from the real truth.<br /><br />Although rather different than Stephen King's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula.
0.88 	 Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'I'll be back' (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).<br /><br />The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser).
0.85 	 And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future.
1.0 	 Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.<br /><br />This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release.
1.0 	 Gone is the horrid letterbox picture.
0.93 	 A far cry from the dreary black & white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars, the Capra films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eye-catching visuals shown in Technicolor.
0.54 	 The movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code.
0.81 	 Geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.<br /><br />I honestly didn't like the style of the movie.
1.0 	 I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much of it.
0.99 	 It gives the comic book like experience.
0.94 	 There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running.
0.94 	 Oh well, and I paid top dollar at the rental.
0.94 	 It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie.
0.83 	 The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s.<br /><br />Walking out of the film, all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s.
0.86 	 Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals.
0.9 	 I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival.
0.86 	 Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the film left off.
0.64 	 Sadly, this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it's worth checking out.<br /><br />MovieManMenzel's final rating for "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a 8/10.
0.99 	 Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film.
0.55 	 You know the one.
0.82 	 This October, Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend.
0.95 	 Prom Night shares this plight.
0.92 	 It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.<br /><br />Our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier.
0.95 	 Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife.
0.51 	 Naaaa."
0.92 	 This is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best.
0.83 	 DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE!!
0.51 	 !
0.76 	 By comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was spell-binding because it held one's interest throughout.
0.81 	 I will check this database before renting any more of his movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies.
0.94 	 As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it.
1.0 	 And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap.
0.99 	 Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv.
0.54 	 It's one that when its on its hard to shut off.
0.8 	 All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right.
0.83 	 check it out if you dare!
0.62 	 you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine (maxim) she looks so good there!
0.94 	 First of all,I don't know why, but everyone here says, that ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy's play is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong!
0.91 	 To my mind, that would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because that would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person.
0.96 	 Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk man, who hasn't shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye...( Thank's God, in this film there're some actors, whose play was awesome!
1.0 	 I suppose, that Alessio Boni coped with his task very well!
0.99 	 I was pleasantly amazed!
1.0 	 He is one of the few people who's read the book, which is very important for the play.
1.0 	 In addition, I liked plays of our Russian actors, that was really wonderful to watch them)) The only thing I liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses!
0.95 	 My advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense, the aim, with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and maybe realize the whole idea of the book... 1 from 10
0.99 	 The word "1st" in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims.
0.59 	 And while suffering through this cobbled together film, by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery.
0.83 	 "Meanwhile, in Cleveland .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 .
0.51 	 ."
0.51 	 !!!
0.51 	 !
0.91 	 Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees - leaping from vine to vine.<br /><br />Oh well, so much for expectations.
0.89 	 There was some guy with a guitar there.
0.85 	 Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments.
0.93 	 He does more than spin webs.
0.52 	 The only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours.
0.62 	 My evaluation: 9 out of 10.
0.75 	 The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues (drugs, prejudice, etc) is the source of the program's brilliance.<br /><br />The blame for this show's failure lies with NBC.
1.0 	 Several times, the show was preempted for an extra half-hour of such dreck as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough)!
0.76 	 The master of movie spectacle Cecil B.
0.89 	 In his brief 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible.
1.0 	 Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic.
1.0 	 Nor is a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the "basis" for this film.
1.0 	 Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the DVD's extras: a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters.
0.97 	 Let's just hope that these films are in better shape than "Jack London"!
0.95 	 Meet Peter Houseman, rock star genetic professor at Virgina University.
0.67 	 Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal.
1.0 	 I'd want to be immortal too if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet female lovin that only VU can offer.
0.99 	 Much to my amazement there are side effects and he, get this, metamorphoses!
0.7 	 into something that is embedded into our genetic DNA that has been repressed for "millions of years".
0.75 	 He also beds Dr. Mike's crush Sally after a whole day of knowing her.
0.93 	 She has a son.
0.92 	 His name is Tommy.
0.51 	 The whole time I watched this I couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989.
0.89 	 The look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest.
0.98 	 It does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as Metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics.
1.0 	 This is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.
0.96 	 As one other IMDB reviewer has remarked, this movie starts a bit slow, but gets considerably better as it goes along.
0.75 	 So it was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies.
0.98 	 A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker - maybe too much, in this case.
0.99 	 And the plot isn't easy to follow: Some zombiefied southeast Asian soldiers in WWI performed very admirably.
0.74 	 The key to long-distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition, who uses it to, among other purposes, temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots.
0.98 	 To prove his love for her, he gives up his hold on everybody, which he shouldn't have done 'cause, once they're all unzombiefied, many want to kill him so that he'll never control them again.
0.96 	 Recommended for only the extremely patient.
0.99 	 Work with it for the first few minutes and you won't be disappointed
0.89 	 <br /><br />(originally written 7/28/2002)
0.51 	 she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie.
0.65 	 I think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role.
1.0 	 Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie.
0.64 	 Not appealing at all.
0.97 	 Camilla Belle played Molly alright.
0.74 	 8 and younger.
0.96 	 Many people thought that this is a good movie but I don't agree with them.
0.5 	 Lastly, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly.<br /><br />In conclusion, I don't think this is a good movie.
0.83 	 *** from ****
0.5 	 Anyway, in the Thorn EMI video there's no music over the opening credits .
0.79 	 Tommy answers because i feel like it .
0.91 	 tommy looks up and says to Alien, what took you so long .
0.74 	 The boy with the robot arm needs a daddy and Alien is drafted in to being Tommy's daddy in the desert .
0.92 	 oh yeah, they need water too .
0.9 	 not THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) by any means but a silly western/post nuke movie with a boy with a robot arm and Alien and Trash and a few other good guys with a mean chick with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL who looks like Wez in the Road warrior .
0.63 	 .on Sunday afternoons on channel 57 (philadelphia, PA) after church i'd come home and find this on .
0.52 	 often .
0.78 	 too often.
0.87 	 A movie you start watching as a late night cable porn.....
0.72 	 I went expecting to see a football movie.
0.69 	 It is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater.
0.51 	 !
0.58 	 Or could the creature be real?
0.69 	 Ever.
0.94 	 Hopefully my vote of 1/10 will help it on it's way.
0.9 	 Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism... but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes, jiggly beach jogs, hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like!
0.97 	 You'll get an eyeful every two minutes.
0.61 	 When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go.
0.99 	 What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line.
0.85 	 By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels.
0.9 	 The scenes at the racetrack, along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded.
0.67 	 Yes, I know I'm one of the few people longing to trample this movie into the dust of oblivion.So let me me tell you why I feel this way.
0.75 	 Give me a break!!
0.83 	 It appears that all young people, but mainly those so-called "vampires", are into various kinds of Metal,judging mainly by their shirts!
0.51 	 :=8P
0.94 	 So you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film, and you might be thinking to yourself, "Huh.
0.98 	 There were sure a bunch of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30."
0.93 	 Funny thing is, most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person, or at best a small, coordinated group of "Open House" groupies.
0.97 	 your actors can dance, (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming.
0.63 	 I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like.
0.96 	 So, you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before.
0.97 	 Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue.
1.0 	 Had the clues been planted more in the movie, one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed.
0.99 	 And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments.
0.99 	 Furthermore, if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end, then how come she is the evil one?
0.95 	 Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages!
1.0 	 They're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest, I guess.
0.71 	 Because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality.
0.81 	 Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of.
0.99 	 I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex, TV, safety/being pampered, etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me.
0.68 	 And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial, are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils, ecstasy, leadership lessons (believe it or not!
0.99 	 ), entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and scary as it may seems, Death!
0.93 	 Some of the stories really fly,and others don't (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes---I won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didn't).
0.96 	 Spoken mainly in English,but does have bits of Yiddish & Russian with English subtitles.
0.62 	 Am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on Showtime.
0.91 	 There were the stereotypes- bible-thumping Reverend without a hint of nuance, authoritative Captain, hot-headed soldier, etc.
0.89 	 FOCUS people.
0.7 	 There's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians-that's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them.
0.98 	 If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them.
0.94 	 The question of their "immortal soul" can be resolved later.<br /><br />Also, I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy, these girls are supposed to be the protagonists?
0.7 	 One of them murdered the Indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives.
0.5 	 This is not appropriate for children at all!
0.85 	 It's just to intense and complicated, not to forget gory, for young kids.
0.94 	 I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on IMDB.
0.75 	 **** out of *****
0.82 	 For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who were paid to do this, I hope you GIVE your money back.
0.86 	 Go see.
0.66 	 It's the kind of film that people should be making.
0.59 	 Daniel's life and ours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man.
0.63 	 Stumbling upon this HBO special late one night, I was absolutely taken by this attractive British "executive transvestite."
0.9 	 I laughed so much that I woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house...
0.68 	 Your brain will than you.
0.99 	 Too bad they don't tour out here...I'd go see them.
0.9 	 See it if for no other reason than to hear some good music.
0.81 	 A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and I love good, small films!
0.99 	 I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Year's 10 Best" list.
0.74 	 I'd strongly recommend watching "The House of Sand" instead--now there's a good, small film!
0.53 	 This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack...
0.9 	 The movie does not do justice to Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood.
0.9 	 I mean he should thank God that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning Razzie awards in India if there were any such awards in Bollywood.
0.72 	 On top of that they don't even know how to copy well.
0.56 	 This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is.
0.94 	 Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the movies are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this one.
1.0 	 Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrific.
1.0 	 They are world class films which are timeless... among the best of this decade.
0.99 	 I have no idea how a Texan (the director, Douglas McGrath) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about Ms. Paltrow was in the first place!
0.79 	 If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD, it was probably 'Delirious' you were looking for.
0.93 	 He was something never before seen.
0.57 	 We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled.
0.75 	 And the car.
0.96 	 It is a two seater!
0.57 	 Largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (although he is really sending up his performance in Fawlty Towers).
0.77 	 See it at your peril.
0.78 	 Was hooked first time I saw it.
0.73 	 Wish I was there acting in with them.
1.0 	 Someone is going to get hurt, there's no stopping that.
0.98 	 I have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide.
1.0 	 Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place, it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate.
1.0 	 It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged.
1.0 	 Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer.
1.0 	 But there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas.
1.0 	 Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied.
0.73 	 Looking at the floor for their marks...<br /><br />Spoilers: Also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie.
0.99 	 All of the planes get blown up and yet again the ONLY person fighting back is the Sky Captain...<br /><br />THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he's the ONLY person ever fighting back.
0.7 	 I saw this in the summer of 1990.
0.67 	 I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished that they would make movies like that still.<br /><br />In fact I saw this movie the night after I had been at a crazy party (not so unlike the one in Jay's house) which had been crashed by what we considered the loser derelicts who hung out on the fringes of our crowd.
0.62 	 It does come out of left field, and REALLY isn't what you're expecting.
0.92 	 The overall cinematography is easy on the eyes, the editing and sound are very good quality, and the twisted story unfolds without clichÃ©s.
0.81 	 While none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster, the "what the hell?"
0.83 	 factor ALONE makes it a film treasure.<br /><br />The people who bash this movie make no sense.
0.9 	 This was not a theater release, it is a DVD release.
0.54 	 Well I had the opportunity to see it so I did.
0.77 	 If you are a fan, don't watch this movie coming in with high expectations.
0.59 	 Oh my god.
0.96 	 In my life.
0.96 	 In my life!
0.79 	 !<br /><br />First of all, G-girl?
0.88 	 I love all his work but this looks like nothing.. sorry..
0.53 	 I think people like it only because "it's from David Lynch".
0.78 	 Where was this supposed to be filmed anyway: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong?
0.99 	 I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those.
0.62 	 There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy.
0.74 	 We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.<br /><br />(spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed.
0.67 	 I was really looking forward to those
0.98 	 The film had some likable aspects.
0.98 	 Perhaps too many for my taste.
0.64 	 <br /><br />This is the job of television, not cinema.
1.0 	 <br /><br />The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as the pregnant friend.
0.53 	 Her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions.
0.99 	 I also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence.
1.0 	 <br /><br />That said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality.
1.0 	 It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine.
0.98 	 A TAC ad with some tasteful animation?
0.76 	 Okay.
0.54 	 But come on.
1.0 	 Mancuso had some great lines, while Nancy Allen, ironically, was completely bland and uninteresting.
0.87 	 No.
0.94 	 Bad parts?
0.71 	 Yes.
0.52 	 Big yes.
0.88 	 I watched the Canadian videotape of this movie as "The Witching" which somehow made its way to New York State.
0.89 	 A ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted.
0.81 	 Despite one of the AKAs of this movie apparently being "The Toy Factory," we never see it, and it's only occasionally referred to at all.<br /><br />On the way to Lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss Mr. Cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion.
0.89 	 They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware.<br /><br />Some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involving.
0.78 	 The original version, according to the end credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life.
0.82 	 The magic of DVD could let us see both versions on one disc, but re-releasing this movie probably isn't a priority.
1.0 	 Chris Rock deserves better than he gives himself in "Down To Earth."
1.0 	 Anybody who saw this gifted African-American comic in "Lethal Weapon 4," "Dogma," or "Nurse Betty" knows he can elicit more laughter with the F-word than Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy put together.
0.73 	 Unfortunately, a more than competent castÂamong them "The Full Monty's" Mark Addy, Chazz Palminteri of "Analyze This," "SCTV's" Eugene Levy, and newcomer Brian Rhodes as Charles Wellington, Jr.Âare wasted in flat-footed, sketchy roles.
0.87 	 Hardcore Rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken.
0.92 	 After Lance learns the Apollo Theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza, he implores Whitney to get him in the line-up.
0.77 	 Meanwhile, fate has something else in store for Lance.
0.94 	 While pedaling home on his bike, our protagonist spots a pretty lady, Sontee (Regina King of "Jerry Maguire"), crossing the street, but he doesn't see the bus that collides with him and kills him.
0.99 	 Lance Barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head.
0.93 	 In Heaven, which resembles a cruise ship nightclub, Lance learns that an overzealous angel, Mr. Keyes (Eugene Levy of "Stay Tuned"), timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule.<br /><br />Heavenly honcho Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri of "Analyze This"), God's right-hand guy, apologizes and escorts Lance back to earth.
1.0 	 The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless, white, 60-year old tycoon Charles Wellington.
0.99 	 Wellington's adulterous wife Amber (Jennifer Coolidge of "American Pie") and his unscrupulous personal aide Winston (Greg Germann of "Sweet November") have just tried to poison him.
0.83 	 Reluctantly, before Wellington's body vanishes, Lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until Keyes can locate a more appropriate body.
0.88 	 Meanwhile, Lance-as-Wellington encounters Sontee again.
1.0 	 While Regina King brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker, she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with Wellington.
0.84 	 Reportedly, he ate lunch with Warren Beatty and told Beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist Elaine May had penned for Beatty.
0.54 	 The deal fell through, and Beatty headlined the movie himself.
1.0 	 According to Rock, his longtime co-writers and he thought that they could 'annihilate' this classic.
0.6 	 Moreover, he justified his choice of "Heaven Can Wait" based on his philosophy to "Do Something you can only do when you're hot."
0.73 	 You know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes, only the laughter.
0.68 	 Similarly, the casting of Mark Addy as Wellington's butler who speaks the Queen's English but is in reality a commoner from Michigan defies logic, too.
1.0 	 About the only redeeming feature of "Down to Earth" is Jamshied Sharifi's superb orchestral film score.
0.94 	 Like the writer (also one of the stars?)
0.95 	 Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!!
0.78 	 <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies.
0.92 	 His father is a harsh Police Constable.
0.52 	 He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end.
0.91 	 His compromise towards unethical practice is negative.
0.99 	 Egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books.
0.98 	 Egon IS 'the' dull intellectual, while Axel IS his exact opposite.
1.0 	 The drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the book's: mainly because the characters are one-dimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying.
0.99 	 Guess who wrote the script?
1.0 	 It is obvious that this talented director (that's what the movie makes clear anyway) is hampered by a deficient screenplay.
0.7 	 Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.<br /><br />7/10
1.0 	 Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies (just look at the Academy Award nominations each year).
0.99 	 But still, the good ones are truly an art form.
1.0 	 Look at "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle", and classics like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night".
0.99 	 Modine is way past being a leading man - especially a romantic lead.
0.9 	 I'm sure as Executive Producer, he had the means - but not the good sense - to cast himself.
0.97 	 Go rent "Moonstruck" again.
0.88 	 This film is not in black and white.
0.96 	 Oh no.
0.63 	 Gypo a good, really the best, friend of the fugitive McPhillip is down on his luck not having a job with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, forced to turn tricks in the Dublin red-light district in order to pay her rent.<br /><br />After an outraged Gypo worked over a potential John who want's to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, an angry Katie tells the not so bright Gyro that he's preventing her for supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has , her body.
0.69 	 Thats enough money for both him and Kaite to travel to America.<br /><br />Gypo going to a local Dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal is startled to run into his friend Frankie McPhillip.
0.63 	 Without as much of a second thought, after he assured Frankie that everything is all right, Gypo secretly goes to the police and informs on his friend who's later shot and killed in a police and Tan shootout in his moms house.<br /><br />With the deed done the chief of police hands over the 20 pound sterling, much like thirty pieces of silver, to an almost emotionless Gypo who takes it and sneaks out the back door of the police station so that one one can see him.
0.89 	 You can see in the police chief's face and actions that he has nothing but utter contempt for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip.
0.85 	 Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend Katie, pointing a finger and implicating him in Frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the British authorities.
0.75 	 Gypo's guilty mind has him getting himself royally and gloriously drunk, on the reward money, that by the time he's forced to to admit his crime to his Irish Republican Army colleagues, who had the almost dead drunk and slobbering Gypo on trial, the money was just about gone in his partying drinking and whoring.<br /><br />Whatever good feelings, if that's possible, that you had for the weak minded and strong shouldered Gypo was completely demolished when in an act of total desperation, in order to keep from getting shot, he falsely implicate an innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime of informing on his friend Frankie McPhillip.
0.92 	 Which is quickly exposed as a total fabrication by non other then the guilt-ridden Gypo himself.
0.88 	 This movie doesn't really get into Beowulf's story, but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior, Beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster's rampage.
0.99 	 If this is successfully accomplished, the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay.
0.59 	 After a few failed attempts, the creature is slain, but it's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving it up to Beowulf to, again, lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it.
0.79 	 Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, calls women "slim" and "dames" and other such nonsense, is the only "real male" i.e.
0.94 	 Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne.
0.9 	 I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while.
0.99 	 The only plus to be found anywhere in the film are Corey Savier's impressive abs.
0.96 	 Yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or have you been living under a rock) and times look bleak.
0.68 	 But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles.
0.78 	 He even gets to take over from the leading man, don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot Shanghai Lil (who is really little Ruby in China-girl wig!
0.92 	 I had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point.
1.0 	 Anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy.
0.96 	 Guilty pleasure, they call it... Nananana ninja...
0.74 	 By all accounts, this could have been an interesting film.
0.97 	 The short story anthology setup was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties.
0.75 	 Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence (the typical 'cop on the edge' formula.
0.86 	 Or Scorsese.
0.82 	 As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filth's score... man, they should sue.<br /><br />The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience.
0.98 	 The title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town.
0.71 	 The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it already dated by the early 90's.
0.51 	 (*1/2)
0.89 	 The same can be said for this movie.
0.8 	 Not so much a new story, but filler and extended background on Timon and Pumbaa, and their place in this story.
0.95 	 The scenes never seem out of place.
0.95 	 The story is just not complete without it.
0.87 	 I really like this movie.
0.92 	 I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it.
0.99 	 The dying master sends the 6th venom, his last student, to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed.<br /><br />How will the last pupil find the other venoms?
1.0 	 How will he know which of them is bad?
0.97 	 It doesn't get any better than this.
1.0 	 An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a one-night stand with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert).
0.62 	 When he meets the first near-victim, McGovern, she immediately twigs to what happened, but agrees to keep quiet for the moment.
0.63 	 (Not that it matters because, after all, he never saw the creep in the first place.)
0.86 	 They'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and McGovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to, just to get him to try to kill her.
0.92 	 But everything will be okay, see, because not only will Guttenberg keep a close watch on her, and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive, but she will keep a can of mace handy -- just in case.<br /><br />I ask you, the alert viewer, does this scenario unfold as planned?
0.93 	 Elizabeth McGovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure.
0.98 	 Steve Guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that's about it.
0.93 	 If Isabelle Huppert can act, it isn't evident in this film.
0.6 	 Confidential"?
0.98 	 That was a nicely done piece of work.
0.63 	 Dick Olsen has a bit part as a late shopper.
1.0 	 He's a neat guy and always reliable.
0.66 	 Paul Shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too.<br /><br />That louche joint where McGovern attracts the attention of the murderer, where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes, was shot at a bar in Carolina Beach, in North Carolina, not far from where I lived.
1.0 	 Actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality.<br /><br />Overall, this is Hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.
0.79 	 I'm not quite sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, Im not even sure if this can be applied.
0.93 	 On the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin.
0.86 	 Therefore, I considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as "serious comedies".<br /><br />Does The 40 Year Old Virgin fit into this guild?
0.99 	 "Nat" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), along with his brainiac friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the always hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are kids with big dreams.
0.58 	 They want to be the first flies in space.
0.88 	 And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, the Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is the animation of the film.
0.98 	 I found it done very well done.
0.93 	 The scenery had depth to it, as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes.
0.99 	 I also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters.
0.65 	 There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story.
0.97 	 The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh.
1.0 	 I did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though.<br /><br />If you are an adult, this is not for you.
0.75 	 This is certainly just for kids.
1.0 	 Other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film.
0.57 	 I don't think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together.
0.99 	 Perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening, but that's about the only fault I can find.
0.86 	 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.
0.82 	 The movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead...back to life.
0.9 	 Of course, as all of these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature.
0.63 	 For this promising setup, you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful.
0.72 	 The translation of the French (for subtitled versions), as well, leaves something to be desired, although this can't be attributed to Demy.
0.99 	 The film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting, such as references in songs to LeGrand himself.
0.95 	 And the costumes - well, the tight pants/white boots combination, and the freakishly unnatural colors, reminds one of an Austin Powers film .
0.51 	 .
0.95 	 .<br /><br />But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; note, for instance, the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg.
0.93 	 Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be quite happy.
0.75 	 It is just as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, if not funnier.
0.83 	 In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao (another recent Dominican film) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected.
0.93 	 The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic.
0.8 	 About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits.
0.95 	 To top it all off (and I guess I should warn you now **SPOILER ALERT**) it all turns out to be a dream.
0.99 	 and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95.<br /><br />When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art?!?!
0.97 	 Perhaps a comedy to match France's Amelie, or an action flick to match Thailand's Ong-Bak, an animation as Akira was to Japan, a witty crime thriller as Layer Cake was to England, or a socio-awakening journey as Waking Life had here in the states.<br /><br />...i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of DR, search Los Jodedores and you'll know what I'm talking about.
1.0 	 Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life.
0.57 	 Billed as a kind of sequel to The Full Monty, about unemployed men in Sheffield, this movie is a fake.<br /><br />As someone born in Sheffield, and still with links to the city, I was extremely disappointed by this film.
0.69 	 This looked like a romantic view of northern England made for the US market.
0.94 	 Probably many Americans - and many southern English people - don't realize that Sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture.
0.59 	 I recognized a few places where I used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of Wales.
0.87 	 The Peak District is, in the summer, crawling with walkers and tourists in cars.
0.98 	 It is situated between two big cities.
0.76 	 I LOVE Don Knotts, let me just say that up-front!
0.73 	 He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the Reluctant Astronaut, but the film is pretty dull, really, even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films.
1.0 	 It's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children.
0.84 	 I'd categorize it as 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night.<br /><br />As with all of Knotts' films, there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky, open-mouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you are.<br /><br />From an adult perspective, one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future!
1.0 	 And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then.
0.99 	 Beware -- you'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching, it's that catchy.
0.55 	 Who knew they could be so funny??
0.82 	 She's no "Stifler's Mom".
0.75 	 Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her "separated at birth" twin or even Elaine herself.
0.52 	 Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism.<br /><br />Unlike 1990's soft-core porn, 70's softie porn retained the hardcore film's realism (something that 2000's soft-core has brought back on occasion, instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms) and it is here in full force.
0.61 	 As a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me.
0.95 	 The movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies, without being overly pretentious.
0.66 	 He's always funny, even when he does or says very little.
1.0 	 When you consider the powerful subject, the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a shame that little attention was given to acting.<br /><br />
0.66 	 That is what I think.
1.0 	 and Grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together.<br /><br />When John was still around I really didn't laugh as much as I do now.<br /><br />It is too bad that no more are being made.
0.97 	 poor Rory is almost always left out.
0.72 	 well even chuckle.
0.76 	 However, I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country.
0.97 	 After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan.
0.69 	 He organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables.
0.89 	 That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from.
0.88 	 Anyway, De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are.
0.97 	 Brilliant!
0.96 	 By a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove.
0.98 	 De Sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this.
0.83 	 The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to it, and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez/Tarantino flick 'From Dusk till Dawn'.
1.0 	 These things do not make a great movie, however, and this is more than evident all the way through 'Curdled'.
1.0 	 The film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who, because of her obsession with grisly murders, takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes.
0.89 	 Angela Jones, or rather; the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction, takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability.
0.89 	 She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself.
0.7 	 Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels.
0.53 	 One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone.
0.91 	 I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called "Pon".
0.78 	 It seems phones are hard to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie.
0.93 	 I'll keep the review of this program as short as possible.
0.59 	 Skip it.
0.81 	 That's all you need to know, but I will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary.<br /><br />This is a film with three segments, each one parodying some other type of movie.
1.0 	 MM parodied films of the 1930's, and did it with elegance, precision and dry wit.<br /><br />This movie did not.
0.51 	 I mean, I remember the 70's, I was there.
0.83 	 This is a soap-opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power.
0.96 	 I noted elements of "The New Centurians" and some "Dirty Harry", both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created.
0.99 	 Yeah, nice and current.
0.93 	 My sides!
0.97 	 How irreverent!)
0.52 	 I want mine back.
0.99 	 On the positive side, Fred Willard's in it!
0.69 	 The acting was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but I was able to see through it most of the time.
0.77 	 I didn't when finally in South Africa in 1993.
0.75 	 Yes, this movie make me feel real horror, when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it.
0.76 	 I'm always supporting independent movies, when it deserves the support, but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies.
1.0 	 It's no huge revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's last movie (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me.
0.86 	 I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review...<br /><br />"I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was strike one in his movie career.
0.51 	 Well, now we've got steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo!
0.94 	 One more strike, and it's back to SNL!"
0.8 	 or "Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but don't buy tickets to Fever Pitch.
0.8 	 You'll walk out of the theater and never go back!"
1.0 	 But hey, I couldn't let my puns go to waste, right?
0.91 	 The mere mention of Pedro Martinez' name sends me running to the bathroom.
0.51 	 Oh man, hold on...<br /><br />...All right, I'm back.
0.9 	 Well, figuratively speaking.
0.6 	 I don't love it so much that I want to marry it, but you know what I mean.
0.75 	 Ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years.
0.97 	 He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals (sorry Mr.
0.65 	 Been there.
0.98 	 Ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome.
1.0 	 Lindsey is embarrassed, and her parents don't know what to think.
0.9 	 Yeah, sports fans can be weird, I don't deny it.
0.95 	 They do have their moments though, like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth "like an adorable stroke victim," but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side that the bros are putting on display.<br /><br />That's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy.
0.98 	 Thankfully, when the sap starts to ooze a bit, the Farrellys know when to pull away.
0.99 	 Is it spongy?"
0.96 	 Ernest Dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment.
0.97 	 Master shot, close up, close up.
0.83 	 We are never given the reasons, other than "no one will miss these people", why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things.
0.99 	 Frankly I don't understand why this movie has been such a big "flop" in publicity.
0.9 	 She is "screwing your brain" as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.<br /><br />As for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors.
0.99 	 Her B-rate "assistants" are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.<br /><br />I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot.
0.65 	 It's been said several times - not least by me - that watching an Eric Rohmer film is like watching paint dry; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer resents this (he doesn't deny it, but then how could he, he just resents it) so much so that his new movie, which may also be his last, Inch Allah, is set so far back in time that it's like watching woad dry.
1.0 	 Those wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea.
0.59 	 I wish more movies were two hours long.
0.75 	 On the other hand, I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long.
1.0 	 The central two are Jake, the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln, and Jack, an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares.
0.77 	 It's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes: if we have some independent reason to like them, or feel as if we know them in some way, then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more.
0.81 	 Good points?
1.0 	 Jewel was nice to look at, and so was the scenery.
1.0 	 The cinematography, nicely framed, looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for Jewel, we were teased with her body, but never actually allowed to gaze upon it, which I think is the least we were owed.
0.82 	 How viewers react to this new "adaption" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards "special effects" being the first and last word in how "good" a film is, are going to love it.<br /><br />Things I did not like about this adaption:<br /><br />1.
0.9 	 They completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been "born bad".
0.58 	 This doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.<br /><br />3.
0.56 	 It's first "victim" died before ever setting eyes on it.<br /><br />4.
0.99 	 The original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through Nel's eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts.
0.98 	 That totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version.
0.81 	 They also tried to make Nel much more of a heroine.
0.92 	 There was also no "Grace" (wife of the original doctor) and Hugh Crain's wives died in totally different ways.
0.69 	 The hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!
1.0 	 My favorite movie of all time remains so.
0.93 	 As that French film critic, whose name escapes me, said: "There is no Garbo.
0.85 	 There is no Dietrich.
0.64 	 And that's what this film is.
0.99 	 It's a shame Louise Brooks was blackballed by Hollywood when she came back to the States--so much talent cast so arrogantly by the wayside!
0.98 	 I never get tired of this film!
0.78 	 I don't think this movie is for everyone.
0.82 	 I haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time.
0.72 	 Not me.
0.5 	 I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time.
0.57 	 If your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit, pop it on you'll get a few laughs.
0.69 	 My thoughts on the movie, 9<br /><br />It was not good, not good at all.
1.0 	 Visually, it was great.
0.99 	 I was pleased with the pacing, the camera angles, etc.
0.83 	 However, the characters?
0.97 	 It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life?
1.0 	 type of exit.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it.
0.99 	 Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily.
0.77 	 Evil humans use it as a weapon.
0.99 	 He gave the Machine his intellect, but didn't give it his heart.
0.92 	 He meets up with another like himself, #2.
0.95 	 <br /><br />Well, #2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine.
0.55 	 #9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue #2.
0.92 	 <br /><br />They succeed.<br /><br />#9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly.
0.96 	 He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out #2's soul in the process.<br /><br />The movie then continues with action scenes with #9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots.
0.67 	 <br /><br />They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine.
0.99 	 They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds.
0.79 	 It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet.<br /><br />Hunh?!
0.51 	 What did it accomplish?
0.7 	 But the son eventually is found out to be a girl.
0.91 	 Hi, Everyone, If you saw "Singing in the Rain," you remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain.
0.99 	 You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor, "Make 'em Laugh."
1.0 	 If you saw "Royal Wedding," you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling.
1.0 	 If you saw "Jailhouse Rock," you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by The King himself.<br /><br />That is what is missing here.
0.94 	 the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film.
0.6 	 He is OK when he is in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at.
0.74 	 A good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it.<br /><br />Next time they do one of these I hope they call me first.<br /><br />Tom Willett
0.92 	 This is not a Hollywood film.
0.74 	 There are virtually no special effects whatsoever, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty.
0.92 	 ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other.
0.78 	 The hillbillies are the human (i.e.
0.98 	 However, i must warn you, this is also an equally depressing movie, as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own, and struggling to breathe.
0.97 	 There is a bit of a spoiler below, which could ruin the surprise of the ONE unexpected and truly funny scene in this film.
0.98 	 There is also information about the first film in this series.<br /><br />I caught this film on DVD, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate.
0.98 	 In addition, many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly.
0.78 	 To boot, the movie was dubbed in English (the first was subtitled), which I tend to find distracting.<br /><br />The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals.
0.95 	 We then jump to modern times where because of some event, the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place.
0.72 	 Thus, when they come back, they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death, which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience.
0.93 	 There's also a time problem: in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars, where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake, which would date it around 1473.
0.99 	 And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well.
0.97 	 It comes somewhat out of the blue, and is easily the funniest scene in the film.
0.83 	 If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film, see the first movie, which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes.
0.7 	 An average TV movie quality, totally formula story of religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good "I'm not just the President of 'Psychos R Us,' I'm also a client.")
0.82 	 Has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic (wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous).
0.8 	 "<br /><br />Worth a rent.
0.71 	 The book version of the film was much better, and well conceived.
0.99 	 If it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book, it could have been a very cool classic.
0.63 	 Disney goes to the well one too many times as anybody who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will feel blatantly ripped off.
1.0 	 Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan on introducing her to King Triton.
0.98 	 The celebration is quickly crashed by Ursula 's sister, Morgana who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to get the King 's trident.
0.99 	 LITTLE MERMAID 2 gives you that feeling everything you watch seemed to have come straight other Disney movies.
0.99 	 It's an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director.
0.9 	 There's no giggly, 'everything that can go right does go right' resolution a la "Bend It Like Beckham".
1.0 	 So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch.
0.88 	 Not this one.
0.96 	 He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour.
0.62 	 We don't buy into the merchandise angle and have our son wearing everything Dooblebop.
0.91 	 I don't think we'd spend money to go to a live show, if they ever came to town.
0.87 	 Going to The Zoo or the Science Centre is a far better experience for everyone involved and in my opinion is money better spent.
0.99 	 The ultimate goal of Big Brother, that we know what to think before we think it, has been realized.
0.51 	 ...
0.97 	 Page has a boyfriend, but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship.
0.91 	 <br /><br />One can't ignore its smug simplicity.
0.89 	 In New York, where Ms.
0.98 	 Page tries her best to fit into and appease a man's world, letting herself be tied up in the ropes of bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and bodices of S & M, the movie is black and white.
0.96 	 Big Brother must be smiling.
0.62 	 You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par.
0.99 	 The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle.
0.62 	 This really should deserve a "O" rating, or even a negative ten.
0.85 	 I watched this show for ages, and the show jumped the shark around series 7.
1.0 	 His novel "Wonder Boys" became a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson.
1.0 	 His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years back, and he had a hand in the script of "Spider Man 2", arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time.<br /><br />Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces, such as the gut-busting "Dodgeball" and the genius short film series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker".
1.0 	 Literally.<br /><br />Jon Foster stars as Art Bechstein, the son of a mobster (Nolte) who recently graduated with a degree in Economics.
0.6 	 Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works a minimum wage job at Book Barn, has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend/boss, Phlox (Suvari), which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex, with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion.<br /><br />One night at a party, an ex-roommate introduces Jon to Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist.
1.0 	 If you do, it will make this night indelible."
0.98 	 Jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by, yet none of them look him in the eye.
0.54 	 "I imagine it must be what death feels like," he says.<br /><br />The next day Jane's wild boyfriend Cleveland (Saarsgard) kidnaps Jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts, doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol.
1.0 	 This doesn't sit well with Phlox, who pushes Jon for a more personal relationship, namely letting her meet his new friends and his father.
0.53 	 The film then attempts to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father, Phlox and his dead-end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane.<br /><br />There is a problem having us follow Jon throughout the film: he's completely uninteresting.
0.99 	 He has no ambitions, passions or goals.
0.88 	 But he never gets any more interesting.
0.69 	 He simply follows along the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself.<br /><br />Consequently, the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party, have sex and get in arguments.
0.79 	 What is this all about?"
0.9 	 We in the audience are dying to know, too.<br /><br />The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are.
0.92 	 The film never lets us in.
0.72 	 If not, then it's VERY close.
0.7 	 Well this is like one of those.
0.98 	 They completely change the personalities of the characters and the events.
0.85 	 because of its retardedness.
0.91 	 Almost everything in the world has sugar in it!!!
0.53 	 In episode "Eddie Monster" when eddy screams at Terrance he falls into the crate twice PLUS the seconed time he falls in he doesn't fall in, he falls off to the side.
0.51 	 Byyyyyyyyeeeee
0.73 	 Everything revolves around that note.
1.0 	 Tom's son joins the army to make up for the note, making Tom join the army as well, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat.
0.95 	 Transistions between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle.
0.89 	 He's helped out first by a Englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on (Rex Harrison!
0.83 	 ), then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then by an Arab called Malik (Kabir Bedi).
0.88 	 The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster, but it's all pretty forgivable.
0.9 	 I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago.
1.0 	 First, I'm going to say that it looks great.
1.0 	 Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer.
0.81 	 I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks.
0.86 	 <br /><br />It's a drama.
0.95 	 There are few uplifting things to say about this, but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile.
0.97 	 The better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car-bash fest creating some tension.
0.97 	 If you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here.
0.98 	 After a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
0.54 	 When I saw this film on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie.
1.0 	 FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from all the actors.
0.82 	 Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it.
0.98 	 Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child.
0.89 	 She touches her child's head, transferring her soul into the child and then dies.
1.0 	 The acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everybody else is excellent.
0.89 	 I got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it.
0.99 	 It had a 7,8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments were pleasant.
0.99 	 Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out.
0.77 	 It starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that I didn't like it very much.<br /><br />You can make a few laughs.
0.54 	 But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining.
1.0 	 I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully.
1.0 	 The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research.
0.53 	 In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics.
0.53 	 Same string of letters two entirely different meanings.
0.94 	 In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty.
0.54 	 Putting soapbox away, God Bless Maegi
0.99 	 My children watch the show everyday that its on.
1.0 	 Its a great program for younger children.
0.99 	 Does the show ever make its way to the United States and if so where can we find its schedule at.
0.87 	 Kids loose interest that way.
0.97 	 The garbage that Hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall!
0.99 	 I don't want to ruin the movie for you but I'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score, why?
0.62 	 Because the movie puts men in their place, that's why.
0.63 	 The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students... to learn how NOT to make a film!<br /><br />Let's see... what did the crew mess up in this flick?
0.94 	 The "evil" robot was hilarious... what was that?
0.94 	 Jazz dancing?
0.96 	 NONE!<br /><br />A perfect example of how not to make a flick... a must see for EVERY serious film student!!
0.51 	 !
1.0 	 This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: MuriÃ«l (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest who is the mother of MuriÃ«l.
0.88 	 They live together in the same building.
1.0 	 They have different expectations of life.
0.83 	 The vital Laura wants a child.
0.97 	 MuriÃ«l comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels.
0.97 	 Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl.
0.58 	 As times goes on, you discover that the director DorothÃ©e Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more.
0.81 	 Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around.
0.65 	 However, after living in the south for six years now, I have never heard this way of talking.
0.79 	 And then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it?
0.77 	 Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which isn't especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character.
0.78 	 Not a cheesy camp-fest, but nothing exceptionally memorable either.
0.82 	 I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub!
0.67 	 I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way.
0.93 	 It's kind of a hobby, really.
0.89 	 And you can just see her seething during takes - doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him.
0.82 	 Audition a bunch of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997).
0.95 	 Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of dignity when alive, has to be rolling over in his grave.
0.75 	 If INXS are at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.
0.99 	 The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell, particularly the character we are meant to identify with (CarrÃ¨re - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it's obliquely suggested might be fraud).
0.63 	 On one occasion CarrÃ¨re dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken.
0.54 	 We have Marcus, a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to PÃ¢querette (French for Daisy) a heavily retarded young man.
0.83 	 I think that's what disturbs me the most, seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically.
0.84 	 I'm actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self-destructive.<br /><br />I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently, particularly with CarrÃ¨re, also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation either.
1.0 	 I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than execution, such as the famous "vagina eye", and the sodomy of Lasalle, for me, totally hollow images.<br /><br />At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with, and some things don't seem logical, for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about CarrÃ¨re's child.
0.94 	 There is no comedic dross or genre segueing, like Cube (1997/Natali), the obvious movie to compare it to, it's a total immersion experience, where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters.
0.6 	 This last comment I make about it being a "pure" experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point.<br /><br />On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian.
0.87 	 The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge.
0.78 	 That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge.
0.96 	 Although this film has it's share of problems, such as continuity, I must say that I would rent the director's next movie.
0.92 	 I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production.
0.99 	 The sets in a Wagnerian production must, of necessity, be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience.
0.75 	 I found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas.
0.84 	 "The House that Bled to Death"
 I could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it!
0.96 	 The husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later the "cursed" house is still for sale.
0.81 	 Or maybe the seemly helpful neighbors cause all the horror?
0.65 	 Little warning though, the sequence with the cat is hard to watch when you're an animal lover.
0.99 	 Her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the 'Rubber House' he had given her.
0.95 	 Once there, she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her.
1.0 	 Within a day, she starts a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the caretaker of the house.
0.95 	 Eddie Murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom.
1.0 	 He is surrounded with his perfect family, full of good family values.
0.85 	 The '80's were not very kind to one-time major star Charles Bronson.
1.0 	 For anyone interested in his best movies, check out most of the films he made in the '60's and '70's like "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once Upon a Time in the West", "Red Sun", "The Great Escape", "The Magnificent Seven", "Rider on the Rain", etc., etc....
0.99 	 They were in auh at first but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in.
0.52 	 and never changes.
0.74 	 Ned is pretty much the same.
0.54 	 It had just the right amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10.)
1.0 	 There was almost no offensive language.
0.87 	 I liked the push for more conservative dress.<br /><br />Corky was a bit of an annoyance.
0.54 	 He was a little out of place on a high school campus.
0.61 	 I never quite got why he was there in the first place.
1.0 	 Still being of school age, and having to learn Shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years (which is very off-putting of any writer, no matter how good), I didn't really expect to enjoy this film when my English teacher put it on; I thought it'd be the typical English lesson movie: bad acting, awfully shot, badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog, so, as you can tell, I was all but ready to go into a coma from the go.
0.9 	 However, I watched and, much to my disturbance, found myself not only paying attention, but actually enjoying the movie too.
1.0 	 It's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on Shakespeare, that his plays are boring (I came to the conclusion it's not the plays that are boring, merely the teachers who recite them in class).
0.58 	 If only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one, English students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the Bard.<br /><br />Overall 7/10
0.92 	 Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch are among the funnier women to have been on "Saturday Night Live".
0.91 	 Yep, just Shiraki.
0.83 	 The premise is original, being about three thirty-something women who were unpopular in high school (and apparently college, too) who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about.
1.0 	 I say "allegedly" because you never quite know what fun is to these characters.
0.89 	 They entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro-woman anthems like "True Colors", and spend their nights together holding make-your-own-pizza parties.
0.99 	 There's a scene where a blind student of Poehler's (played by Poehler's real life husband Will Arnett) asks her out on a date, only to touch her face and immediately change his mind.
0.94 	 If Poehler's character is supposed to be unattractive, they obviously hired the wrong actress.<br /><br />The movie continues to show promise, even though we have our doubts about the main characters, when Posey's boss, Texas Senator 'Kay Bee' Hartmann (Jane Lynch, funny as always) hires Posey to watch over her unpopular college-age daughter (Amber Tamblyn, playing yet another woman who's attractive in real life, but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie) while she goes to a Laguna Beach-like vacation spot for Spring Break.
0.97 	 Poehler and Dratch come along, they reluctantly get boozed up, party like they apparently should have when they were in college, and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by Sophie Monk.<br /><br />Sophie Monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons.
0.95 	 Here, she plays a Southern belle, although her voice sounds like she stole Delta Burke's voice box.
0.79 	 If director Shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input, especially Rachel Dratch, this movie would have been great and not nearly as run-of-the-mill as frat-house comedies we've seen before.
0.98 	 She's funny enough, and she deserves better than this half-baked comedy that would accept Stiffler's brother with open arms.
0.51 	 ..Oh wait, I can!
1.0 	 It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake.
0.86 	 If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.
0.87 	 I did not like Chandni Bar from the same director.<br /><br />I did not watch his other movies.
0.76 	 Seems real.
0.6 	 Serious movie, not to be watched with children or expecting wives.
0.7 	 Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported.
0.99 	 In this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot.
0.93 	 This makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for.
0.99 	 In fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap.
0.57 	 Definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.
0.72 	 <br /><br />Neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.<br /><br />The film's plot, such as it is, concerns three loosely interconnecting stories, none of which conclude satisfactorily.<br /><br />The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes.<br /><br />First we have Dylan McDermott, looking darn fine, as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter, when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by Helen Hunt.<br /><br />Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, not sure which one, playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman, an attractive redhead, whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension.
0.98 	 I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies.
0.99 	 And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this ain't.
1.0 	 She is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses!
0.95 	 This film is not without flaws - it is overly long, and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel.
0.98 	 Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed, and I never could figure out why she was in the film, except to placate Myrtle.
0.89 	 I had been looking forward to How to Lose Friends & Alienate People for months, particularly due to the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Simon Pegg were starring.
0.83 	 How to Lose Friends & Alienate People hit the spot!
0.72 	 How to Lose Friends & Alienate People follows the life of Sidney Young, a smalltime, bumbling, British celebrity journalist, who is hired by an upscale magazine in New York City.
0.98 	 Instead, Sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst).
0.97 	 He makes Sydney bumbling, obnoxious, and annoying as real as it gets, but later in time making Sydney not just likable, but also a real character who you root for in the end.
0.74 	 How can you not like him?!
0.91 	 Each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable, but that's what just made the film work.
0.94 	 I understand that most were the supporting cast, but some of the cast was underused and could've given the film some more spice to it.
0.67 	 So...we get so see added footage of Brando...interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff.
0.93 	 New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets.
0.6 	 Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let's listen to Donner make fun of Lester's version that made more logical sense.
0.92 	 Then there is the ending with the "turn back the world to go back in time" effect.
1.0 	 I respect the fact that this is a very popular show.
1.0 	 However, in comparison with Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, zany, and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic, this show was probably destined to be less-than-mediocre... even if it did run for 11 years, that doesn't necessarily make it any good.
0.71 	 This show formed an all-too-integral part of my early childhood (it was on re-runs every night, and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up), but it's one of the memories I don't miss.
0.99 	 His style of humor is totally different, as are his characterization and outlook.
0.84 	 The new characters are not that great; they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing.
0.87 	 It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr).
0.51 	 Oh, yeah.
0.68 	 With a laugh track (it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not), it comes across as creepy, due to what's going on in the other settings.
0.97 	 I've never liked this show, and I never will.
1.0 	 I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid, though.
0.65 	 There are many good movies to see, and in short, this one is not one of them.
0.9 	 <br /><br />Jason Vanness
0.99 	 God gracious have mercy on us!
0.66 	 <br /><br />Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off, Return of the Joker, dug deep with the characters involved.
0.67 	 Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in it's prime.
1.0 	 As Willis asserts "It's already happened," while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself.
0.59 	 All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.<br /><br />Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery.
0.6 	 It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it.
0.61 	 Yes there is a 180 degree slip/clip in there, but shi* happens.Did anyone else see Hugh's dirty shirt turn white (near the end,in the rain) in "Australia"?
0.94 	 Look how much money and people were behind that movie!
0.95 	 Only 2 things I would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning-Don't walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera, and I would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot, so people wouldn't necessarily know what it is.<br /><br />My experience so far has taught me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie,it just takes time to learn how to do it,then the time to actually do it, and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you'll need to have shot before you call "post-production time!"
0.81 	 IMHO, it looks like director/writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this indeed is his first report card, I'd give him an "A".
0.92 	 The rest of you report to the principals office for a whuppin'.
0.62 	 Disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising.
0.98 	 I can't believe I'm saying that.
0.68 	 It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion.
0.82 	 (but not quite!)
0.51 	 The film stars champion gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of "Parmistan" to enter and hopefully win "The Game," a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the Khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like "Yak Power."
0.64 	 The goal of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system.
0.96 	 Jonathan is trained in the martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house.
0.78 	 Once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white.
1.0 	 Still there's the germ of a good action adventure here.
1.0 	 A Hong Kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good.
0.61 	 Think of a no-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes John Woo and you'll get 'Power Play.'
0.83 	 It might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story.
0.99 	 None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.<br /><br />Framing story: Adam West is... well, himself.
0.64 	 Then you've seen this.
1.0 	 As well directed as can be expected, but basically incoherent.<br /><br />Nex's Diner: Reminiscent of various Serling time travel stories, mixed with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds."
0.99 	 I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls.
0.57 	 The main character is mildly sympathetic.
0.99 	 Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!
0.73 	 ), and the guy in the first segment died.
0.51 	 Huh?
0.74 	 But still...<br /><br />Overall: basically not dissimilar from the two newer Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters.
0.76 	 The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time.
1.0 	 But there's nothing really spectacular here.
0.67 	 Who could ask for more?
0.79 	 It doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman.
0.99 	 Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been.
0.98 	 A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself "The Devil" (hence the title).
0.7 	 It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap.
0.81 	 I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!
0.62 	 ), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it.
0.91 	 I got this one with the title Christmas Evil.
0.94 	 There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night.
0.88 	 Whereas Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had lots of potential and was very close to being good, this one wasn't quite as good.
0.94 	 About an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror, and the guys he kills aren't even his targets they are just making fun of him.
0.99 	 Well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play.
0.95 	 How does it end you ask, well since I have spoilers I will tell you.
0.51 	 !
0.99 	 If you enjoy films like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs.
0.62 	 Consider yourself warned!
0.95 	 "ASTONISHING" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box.
0.62 	 The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals, and murder innocent people just to stay alive.
0.68 	 Their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads etc that are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set.
0.92 	 Then, on the same paragraph he compares himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero.
0.94 	 Now you're just being silly.<br /><br />Do you enjoy this film?
0.73 	 If so, you must be a member of said cult.
0.92 	 Do they pocket your wages?
0.95 	 Do they let you see other family members?
1.0 	 Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson films till you think he's the best director since A.Hitchcock?
0.93 	 Do tell... this sounds like a Panorama special brewing to me.
0.79 	 And say hello to the critic of the LA times when you return to your colony, will you?
0.51 	 0/10
0.88 	 A man wants revenge for a crime- but when he enacts his revenge- there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time.
0.71 	 Because, after disposing of one big cat, a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left.
1.0 	 Great, groovy.
0.92 	 Out of the ones who do live, only one has completed their task, so I got a kick out of that.
0.62 	 If I had only gotten away so easy.
0.6 	 I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants.
0.91 	 You surely expect something different!
0.93 	 Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years.
0.52 	 If only the script was as shattering as the glass, then "The Broken" would have been a brilliant film.
0.62 	 I got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and "meaning" of the film.
1.0 	 He thinks Ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die.
1.0 	 "The Broken" centers on the American McVey family living in London, and particularly Gina.
0.99 	 When a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events.
0.92 	 Gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building.
0.52 	 When dismissed, Gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing.
0.96 	 She doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes.
0.9 	 Does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her?
0.62 	 Writer/director Sean Ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them.
1.0 	 "The Broken" is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package.
0.69 	 This means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far.
0.95 	 By the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore.
1.0 	 Some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly Sean Ellis' style with the repertoires of David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick and even Alfred Hitchcock, but that is way, way 
 WAY too much honor.
0.98 	 It's success can only be described as a marketing marvel.
0.94 	 Thelma Ritter did steal the picture.
0.64 	 I just finished watching it again.
0.93 	 She didn't get the Oscar.
0.94 	 That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars.
0.69 	 Yes, it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but, without it, you don't have much of a film.
0.99 	 The top three stars didn't really need much script.
0.97 	 I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue.
0.84 	 That's when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted.
0.9 	 But I did find the river.<br /><br />I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself.
0.75 	 If you have seen it, no elucidation is necessary.
0.91 	 If you had never heard of the real story of Gram Parsons then it might seem a reasonably entertaining diversion.
0.88 	 Johnny Knoxville can't really be criticised for his performance as Phil Kaufman - he's pretty good at looking laid-back and down to earth and you can sort of root for his long-suffering everyman.
0.85 	 We all know his real father committed suicide when he was young - something that could surely be compared to Gram's life on the edge by a better film-maker.
0.51 	 Having Forster as his supposed real father, and not his step-father would be bad enough, if not for the well known difficulties Gram had with the man who actually flew to collect his body.
0.73 	 When you think of the ingredients that could have been used in a good movie about Parsons, the shortcomings of this film are easily apparent.
1.0 	 Country music being changed by a young, polite, southern gentleman - who was also long haired, drug loving, popular with the ladies and ultimately self destructive.
0.8 	 Instead of these things we have to concentrate wholly on Kaufman's input into Gram's life.
0.83 	 Kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did (he certainly is a little cult).
0.99 	 From interviews it is obvious that he's delighted with the attention.
0.57 	 Looking at Knoxville and the director in interviews, a few things become clear also.
0.77 	 They want a hit movie about an event that is infamous and crazy.
1.0 	 It was an amazing life with a strange end.
0.98 	 That the end is the only thing covered by this movie shows how limited an understanding of Gram Parsons the makers had.
0.85 	 I work at a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies, these are the kind of movies that the Sci-Fi channel shows.
0.88 	 ( This is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign, or a documentary.)
0.98 	 This aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm.
1.0 	 Glad so many of you enjoyed it!
0.66 	 <br /><br />
1.0 	 Along with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Director Stanley Kramer's 1967 master piece.
0.56 	 So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home (Insert GASP here) to his grand father's funeral.
0.98 	 His family members reactions were of course....predictable.
0.72 	 Do yourself a favor and rent the original.
0.7 	 Take a pass on Wake.
0.99 	 They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city.
0.62 	 The content is pretty much made up of two things.
1.0 	 These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing.
0.87 	 The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties.
0.71 	 The acting was spot on and I felt for all the characters situation, even though the true family unit was not completely revealed.
1.0 	 We never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with Tobe.
0.99 	 I mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off.
0.89 	 We are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience.
0.9 	 Finally getting my hands this week on a VHS copy that was being thrown away (and isn't that just par for the course..?)
0.75 	 Some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed Jackson-lovers, others as Jackson-haters; I'm not exactly either.
0.94 	 (The only exception to the latter, as others have remarked, is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of Rivendell, where the Ringwraiths, having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back Frodo in mid-flight -- which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river -- then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop, which is initially nightmarish but pointless, plot-wise, and definitely goes on too long.)
1.0 	 I would also agree that the Balrog is unsatisfactory, due partly to bad animation, and that Gandalf windmills his arms too much.<br /><br />But having watched both approaches to the film, I feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take.
0.66 	 In a tale that is half-myth (oddly enough, one thing that is included is a snippet of Aragorn's story of Beren and Luthien) the extreme literalism required by live-action filming, where everything from monsters to mail-shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera, is counter-productive: latex-faced (or CGI) monsters are less monstrous than sketchily-drawn shapes, heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies, and hobbits or dwarfs with non-human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly.
0.8 	 The hobbits are, I suspect, intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience-identification figures: I find the animated style (their proportions are much more 'cartoonish' than those of the human characters) works well to differentiate them, and the whole 'hairy feet' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions, including much fan art.<br /><br />Personally I have less objection to Boromir as Viking -- he was always a fairly bludgeoning type -- than to beardy-Aragorn (illogical: they were both Numenorians, after all), although I am clearly in a minority here!<br /><br />The big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project, with a bizarre tacked-on voice-over ending attempting to resolve matters.
1.0 	 A pity; it would have been interesting, not to mention less frustrating, to see what Bakshi planned to make of Shelob and Minas Tirith, never mind the Dead...
1.0 	 This Fantasy is modeled after the "Walking with Dinosuars" series.
0.66 	 Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos.
0.78 	 Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci-Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.<br /><br />On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes.
0.73 	 But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10.
0.93 	 I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.<br /><br />I also think this weakens the great "Walking with Dinosuars" series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.
1.0 	 The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at.
0.94 	 I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself, but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution.
1.0 	 Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament.<br /><br />I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD.
0.79 	 But it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen.
0.81 	 So he does; as only `Dirty Harry' can.
0.91 	 employed by the perpetrator.
0.52 	 `Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, Eastwood `is' Dirty Harry, without question, just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.'
0.99 	 The beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing , but sit tight, because you are in for the ride of your life.
0.64 	 The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs.
0.98 	 ...and you can look at that statement in different ways, by the way.
0.79 	 Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here.
0.97 	 Now, I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence', but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !!
0.77 	 The "movie" contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story.
0.92 	 Not very informative, if you ask me.
0.98 	 With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? )
0.66 	 It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual.<br /><br />The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula.
0.95 	 It doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending.
0.95 	 Before seeing this, I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated "Emmanuelle" series starring Sylvia Kristel.
0.72 	 But only after a very long courtship, as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman.
0.98 	 Her place in society is gone, she has been debased.
0.98 	 One would expect lots of sex and nudity here, but there is not much.
0.78 	 After catching it on late night cable TV years ago, I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film.
0.97 	 When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer.
0.93 	 More sex?
0.99 	 No, more melodrama.
0.64 	 For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease!
0.94 	 I actually preferred the cable version better.
0.91 	 There was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached.<br /><br />Not for people who like the regular old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent films.
0.82 	 But it was still an OK horror film with some good action.
0.99 	 I did not think that it was one of the best in the series.
0.51 	 4/10
1.0 	 Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie.
0.66 	 "<br /><br />3/10
0.8 	 Like many people she is an endless dreamer, and she holds onto her dreams, never giving up.
0.82 	 Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than I anticipated.<br /><br />The setting was interesting, strange but interesting.
0.88 	 The storyline had gaps/jumps that I think throws the audience off a bit.
0.99 	 There was some inexplicable strange chemistry that I couldn't resist; I fell in love with it and here I am, writing this review.
0.96 	 I had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things I didn't catch at first.
0.52 	 I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope YOU do.
0.8 	 It was written by the same guy that wrote and directed "Arthur" and though it isn't as funny as that movie, it does show the potential that Steve Gordon reached with "Arthur".
0.99 	 The martial arts are 'ok', but when put next to the Jackie Chan movies and "The Matrix" you're better off seeing one of those.
0.78 	 Was it a happy ending?
0.96 	 Trust me, you will probably thank me if you don't watch this movie.<br /><br />3/10
0.61 	 The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space.
1.0 	 "Nil by Mouth" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu.
0.96 	 Ditto for "In the Warzone."
1.0 	 And although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.
0.69 	 A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to "the Iranians."
0.59 	 Max, the explosives expert.
0.99 	 These teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest, who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously.
0.85 	 The sole administrator of this "Academy" is a young and seductive headmistress, and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash, so to speak.<br /><br />Sexual overtones abound, and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies.
0.96 	 It gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days...
1.0 	 Just as "ITS A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD" is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made, this one is at the very bottom.
0.94 	 I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees.
0.59 	 Just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough.
0.67 	 Why is this?
0.94 	 Until I heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen.
0.65 	 <br /><br />Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF, so can other artists.
0.87 	 <br /><br />Would recommend this film
0.56 	 This time Harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation.
0.66 	 Harry's always on the job it seems.
0.81 	 Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear.
0.96 	 This doesn't mean that it's quality is any less.
0.61 	 How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me.
0.95 	 The attitude of 'ah, it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same'.
0.93 	 A great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old.
0.6 	 Cringeworthy stuff.
0.99 	 International Audiences be warned: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock.
0.84 	 Intermission is a walk-outer
0.99 	 Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent.
0.98 	 ... (Go ahead censure me, my conscience is clear.
0.51 	 ).
0.87 	 This films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy B movie.
0.94 	 It will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy.
0.99 	 It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese.
1.0 	 But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go, "Hmmmmm... that's so stupid!"
0.67 	 and then have you laughing.
0.82 	 Hmmmm... hahahah!
0.98 	 I could not stop laughing.
0.68 	 And the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny.
1.0 	 You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible.
0.77 	 Her air time in the film was pretty short though.
0.96 	 More so because this is a man who cannot react accordingly to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows how: via screams, shrieks, and profanities aimed at hurting himself.
0.96 	 Unless you're a prude, I heartily recommend this movie.
0.8 	 Would have better strengthened considerably by making it as a<br /><br />50 minute episode of the Outer Limits.
0.88 	 The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and watching an American Rochester felt strange.
1.0 	 The scenery and music were all very nice, but I could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved.<br /><br />If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with CiarÃ¡n Hinds and Samantha Morton.
0.99 	 Now these two are brilliant adaptations.
0.51 	 I have always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun.<br /><br />It really wasn't.
0.85 	 He's a brave man.
0.72 	 "Oh god - it's his ear!"
0.62 	 <br /><br />I realise I'm making this movie sound rather fun.
0.96 	 He try's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body.
0.55 	 I'm looking forward to the next film.
0.81 	 In spite of that, it seemed very unlikely that I'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself.
0.9 	 And you can almost never say that.
0.81 	 Most films would never even expect such a thing of you.
0.71 	 As far as I can gather, this film is not very representative of it.
0.86 	 Maybe much of what makes "The Stone Boy" what it is was the time period it was made in.
0.75 	 I see myself in this.
0.77 	 As much as the movie was good, i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already.
0.95 	 "If I wanted to dribble, I'd call a nurse."
0.87 	 <br /><br />"Haven't you had enough?"
0.89 	 ..."More than enough.
0.96 	 "<br /><br />"If I begin to die, please remove (the cowboy hat) from my head.
0.87 	 <br /><br />Judge Miller
0.93 	 Okay, so it's not that scary.
0.93 	 BUT, her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a Santa suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) comes her way.<br /><br />If you look it up on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing).
0.89 	 But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do.
0.91 	 In a way it's a slacker movie for girls.
0.71 	 The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me.
0.88 	 As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement.
0.99 	 We suck.
1.0 	 My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help.
0.94 	 Oh My God!
0.89 	 Please, for the love of all that is holy, Do Not Watch This Movie!
0.98 	 Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual.
0.84 	 This movie feels like a film project.
0.66 	 As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work.
0.88 	 Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though.
1.0 	 Despite this amateurish feel, the movie is effective.
0.92 	 Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality.
0.72 	 I can't imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel's argument.
0.99 	 Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster, and their niece and nephew.
0.87 	 Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates?
1.0 	 If you do wish to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically thrilling "Space Station 3D".
0.74 	 Trust me.
0.86 	 I hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to "go to hell", as Rose so bluntly put it.
0.81 	 Shut up!".
0.78 	 Dying to save the others.
0.99 	 I felt really sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared.
0.97 	 I was like "Oh my god if I was Rose I'd be so scared for him".
0.54 	 hands off!"
1.0 	 No rubbish - no where even near rubbish.
0.77 	 Not an original?
