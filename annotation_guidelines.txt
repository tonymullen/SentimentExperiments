1   : Compares/contrasts with some other work
    # examples:
    I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights.
    I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time.
    I actually prefer the sequel to this film as I like the fact they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is.
2   : Sarcasm. Exact opposite of meaning.
3   : Subject matter sentiment. Score reflects subject matter rather than reviewer's opinion.
    # examples:
    In addition to the dramatization of historical events, the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother.
